A Facultyâ€”Alumni baseball game will be an in-
stitution at Finals this year. The contest will precede
the annual boat race at â€œthe Islandâ€ on Monday,
June 6th. One admission will cover both events.

for the game in order that the finish of the Albert Sid-
neyâ€”Harry Lee classic may be seen advantageously.

Prof. C. FE. Williams, of Real Property fame, will
captain the Faculty nine. Eddie Parks Davis, â€™15, in
his usual red flannel uniform, will captain the assem-
bled alumni diamond stars. A line up has not been
worked out, but the Alumni Magazine suggests the

Lofberg, W. B. Dominick, Howard Thompson and
Frank Gilliam, outfielders. The Alumni team de-
pends upon the men returning for Finals. If you
plan to return communicate with Eddie Davis and
then borrow a glove and ball and limber up for the
coming classic. :

â€œBossâ€ Moreland, Dean â€œHarry,â€ â€œHowdyâ€ Howe
and â€œPrexyâ€ Smith will be on hand to coach from the
side lines or umpire. Forest Fletcher and Captain
Dick Smith will coach the Faculty and Alumni teams
respectively.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE 9

Judge McDermott, Trustee, to Speak at Finals Alumni Meeting

Judge Charles J. McDermott, trustee and ardent
supporter of Washington and Lee, has accepted the
invitation of the Alumni, Inc., to speak at its annual
Commencement meeting in the Carnegie Library,
Monday, June 6th at 11:30 A. M. He will talk upon
the subject â€œWhoâ€™s on Your Campusâ€. He is well
qualified to talk upon this subject, due to the inti-
mate and active connection which he has main-
tained with the W. & L. Alumni, Inc., and to his con-
nection with the Alumni Association of the Columbia
University Law School, of which he is first vice-
President. ,

Since his election to the Board of Trustees of Wash-
ington and Lee in 1920, Judge McDermott has given
much time and attention to the affairs of the Uni-
versity. He is an alumnus of Adelphi Academy,
Brooklyn, and of the Columbia University Law School,
receiving his LL.B. in 1889.

After graduation Judge McDermott continued
the practice of law in New York City. He was ap-
pointed Judge of the Kings County N. Y. Court by
Governor Whitman in 1917 and elected to that posi-
tion in 1918. He resigned and reentered the practice
of law in January, 1921.

At present Judge McDermott is president of the
Brooklyn Law Library, a member of the Board of
Trustees of Washington and Lee, of Adelphi Acad-
emy, of the College of the City of New York, a mem-
ber of the Board of Higher Education of New York
City and first vice-President of the Columbia Law
School Alumni Association. He has many important
business connections in and about New York, includ-
ing the Doremus Estate. He is an executive commit-
teeman of the Phi Delta Phi (legal fraternitv) As-
sociation in New York, a trustee of the Good Samari-
tan Dispensary, a member of the Finance Committee
of the Brooklyn Home for Consumptives, of the
Courtâ€™s Committee of the Brooklyn Bureau of Chari-
ties, and of various bar and lawyers associations.

Athletics, hunting and fishing are his recreative in-
terests. He was for many years Governor of the
Crescent Athletic Club, then president and then vice-
president. He is a member of the Narrow Bay Gun
Club, the Long Island Country Club and of the Cherry
Valley Club.

In April, 1924, Judge McDermott was appointed
Deputy Attorney-General for the prosecution of cases

DAN OWENâ€™S HAM

You have not received the highest degree of atten-
tion to which prodigals are entitled unless you have
partaken of the ham, â€œtheâ€ ham being the annual sac-
rifice made by porkers on Dan Owenâ€™s farm for the
gastronomic delight of returning alumni at Finals. Of
course there is cheese and crackers, pickles and ap-
ples, but the â€œpiece de resistanceâ€ is the ham.

Midnight is the accepted time for performance of
the ritual. A foreign element in the shape of Lex-
ington baked bread is introduced, then someone pro-
duces a rusty pocket knife with which the ham is
gracefully carved. A pencil serves as a pickle fork.
Cheese and crackers are easily managed. After the ap-
ple course, reminiscences begin. Dan is good for sev-
eral yarns, then â€œEdâ€ Caffrey will thrill you with
murder cases which he has tried; other yarns from
varied fields will mingle with the mellow smoke of
glowing pipes as the night wanes into dawn.

So come back Finals if you want to know Dan.
May be, if the signs are right, you will be introduced
to the order of the ham. Three Finals are required
before permanent initiation will be granted. â€™27 is a
good time to start.

Marse Robertâ€™s Hoss

A recent issue of Colliers Weekly contains an in-
teresting account of â€˜Traveler, General Robert E.
Leeâ€™s famous horse. The account is written by James
C. Young and contains the recollections of an old
negro named William Mack Lee who was an attend-
ant of General Lee during the war. â€˜The following is
what William has to say about â€˜â€œMarse Robertâ€™sâ€
horse:

â€˜â€œâ€œMarse Robert paid a thousand dollars foâ€™ Traveler
in Yellow Brier County,â€ said William. â€˜That hoss
knew more than I did. He sure was a beauty. Yes,
sir; his tail swept the ground. He was an iron gray
with a black mane and tail. He had a little head, a big
chest and flat legs, a regular racer. Run? He use
to run like a streak, Marse Robert risinâ€™ and fallinâ€™
with him over the hills. He was a snortinâ€™ hoss, too,
specially when he smelled powder. Didnâ€™t care for
it at all when Marse Robert bought him. Iâ€™ve seen
Traveler raise right up on his hind legs at the first
shot and snort terrible when he smelled the powder.
Kind of wild-eyed and wantinâ€™ to get away from here.
But he learned to know the smell, a war horse for
fair. Hâ€™d walk across the battle fields, steppinâ€™ light
as a lady so he wouldnâ€™t paw none of the men. Some-
times heâ€™d lick their faces when Marse Robert let the
reins fall. â€™Peared to know they was hurt and needed
somebody to care foâ€™ them.

A great hoss, Traveler was. Three years old when

we got him and proud as a Lee. You couldnâ€™t treat

 

him like an ordinary hoss. He had to have fresh
oats, or none. Wouldnâ€™t drink out of a dirty trough
neither. Particular as his master. They sure kept me
busy them two, tryinâ€™ to provide foâ€™ their wants when
we didnâ€™t have nothinâ€™ to provide sometimes. But let
Marse Robert come out of his tent and there was
Traveler, whinnyinâ€™ and ready to start. Rode him all
through the war and neither one got a hair singed. He
lived long after Marse Robert; got to be twenty-five
years old, I guess.â€

WHERE TO STAY

Alumni headquarters will be in the central wing of
Leeâ€™s Dormitory for Finals. Rooms will be provided
in the Dormitory for unaccompanied alumni. Those
returning with their wives and families are urged to
make reservations at the Robert E. Lee, Dutch Inn
or at private homes at an early date.

The Alumni Secretary will be at Alumniâ€™ head-
quarters in Leeâ€™s Dormitory at all hours during
Finals. Every visiting alumnus is asked to register
there. Information and every possible assistance will
be given by the Secretary.

John W. Leigh, â€™21, of Memphis, Tenn., has been
promoted to manager of the Meridian branch of the

BASEBALL

At the first call for diamond candidates, Captain
Dick Smith found few new faces. Except at short
stop and left field the positions were occupied as at
the close of last season. â€œTyâ€ Rauber, football ace,
was moulded into the short stop position, â€˜â€œApieâ€
Lowden from last yearâ€™s freshman team was given
the out field post and Ginsburg and Eaglebach, vet-
erans, alternated with White, a newcomer, at third.
In the box the veterans Folliard and Maben were as-
sisted by Osterman and White, Tipps and Jones be-
hind the plate, Spotts at first, Captain Mike Palmer
at second, Sterns in right field and the old timer,
â€œTipsâ€ Gwaltney, in center, completed the line-up.

The high spots of the season were seen in a 2â€”O
defeat of Georgia Tech. at Atlanta when â€œSnakeâ€™â€™
Maben let the golden tornado nine down with three

hits, and the crushing defeat handed Virginia 8â€”O, â€”

by Paul Folliard in the first classic encounter of the
season. Hard hitting and erratic fielding character-
ized the Gerenalsâ€™ play throughout the year. Im-
portant games were lost to Georgia Tech., Virginia,

HERRON SAYS NEW GRID CHANGES WILL
NOT AFFECT GENERALS

â€œThe new changes recently effected in the football
rules will not change the play of the Generals,â€ stated
Coach Pat Herron when interviewed recently.

One of the changes made by the rules committee of
American football affected the shift play, making it
necessary for a team to halt two seconds after a shift
has been made. â€˜The lateral pass in football will un-
dergo a change under the ruling by the committee so
that in case of a fumble behind the line of scrimmage
the ball will not be lost except on the fourth down.

Goal posts will no longer be on the goal line, but
ten yards behind it. This ruling will make the point
after touchdown harder to secure for teams using the
drop-kick method of securing the extra point. Also
a fumble may no longer be scooped up and taken for
a touchdown, however, the-ball will go to the team
recovering the fumble.

Coach Herron, mentor of the Generals says, â€œThe
new ruling in regard to the shift play will help the de-
fense of the teams not in the habit of using the shift

play as part of their offense. Washington and Lee

grid teams will profit by this change, as we do not use
the shift play.â€ | |

In regard to the ruling on the lateral pass, Coach
Herron stated, â€œUnquestionably it will make the lat-
eral pass more popular among teams. â€˜The risk which
has heretofore been attached to the use of this play
has been removed and more coaches will undoubtedly
use it in their style of game.â€

â€œWe met with the lateral pass in only one instance
last season, and that was at Princeton. The Tigers
only used it once, however,â€ Coach Herron added.

â€œThe ruling about the point after touchdown will
make the extra point more difficult to make and will
of course cause more tie games,â€ it is thought by Coach
Herron. He also said that a fumbled punt and run-
ning for a touchdown merely eliminates one more
break of the game and will have no effect on gridiron
strategy whatever.

 

WRESTLERS CHOSEN

At the close of the wrestling season three W. & L.
grapplers were chosen for places on the All-South-At-
lantic Wrestling team. Those chosen were Captain
Rule, â€œMikeâ€ Seligman and Wilkes. Two men from
V. M. L, one from V. P. I. and one from Virginia
were chosen on this mythical eleven.

 

Kappa Sigma won the interfraternity basketball
tournament by defeating the Phi Epsilon Pi quint 23
to 8. The game was marked by the close guarding of

both teams and the sensational shooting of the win-
ners.

CINDER TRACK IS COMPLETED

The cinder track is at last a reality. Work on it

which extended over a period of seven months was

finally culminated. Washington and Lee now has one
of the finest outdoor tracks in the South. Â»This was
the opinion voiced by several of the athletic authorities
in the University. |

The jumping pits which will be a part of the track,
have not yet been completed, but they will be directly
in front of the stadium and will be three in number:
broad jump pit, pole vault pit, and high jump pit. The
permanent pits are not being constructed now because
of the desire to finish the sodding of the field. The
temporary pits for this season will be placed at the
north end of the gridiron.

The cinder path has been built according to regula-
tions a quarter of a mile in length. The longest
stretch of straight-a-way will be 150 yards in length.
The track is wide enough for six lanes of hurdles,
ample enough to take care of any meets held here.

The starting point will be at the north end, while all
finishes will be directly in front of the stadium. When
final completion is made the project will be one of the
finest of its kind in the Southern Conference.

 

â€œCYâ€ TWOMBLY HURLING WELL

FE. P. Twombly, the Generalsâ€™ own, was crashing
through in masterful style in his pre-season workouts
with the Newara Bears, according to the sports dope
emanating from the New Jersey metropolis. From
all accounts â€œCyâ€ surprised Manager Figanâ€™s out-
fit with his condition, which he got as a result of
working out with the Generals almost daily for sev-
eral weeks.

The part of the sophomore gym and suicide classes
in preparing Twombly for his summer mound duties
with the International League club has not been over-
looked by the scribes of Newark. They speak highly
of the physical condition of their right-handed ace in
every story, and attribute a large part of it to his work
in the local physical education department.

 

AN ALL-TIME W. & L. FOOTBALL TEAM

We have All-American, All-Southern, All-South
Atlantic teams. Why not have an All-Time W. & L.
football team, suggests an interested alumnus. Itâ€™s a
good suggestion.

The ALUMNI MaGazINnE woud like to receive nom-
inations from alumni. Nominations should be lim-
ited to players of the modern football gameâ€”(not
the Rugby game in vogue in the â€™80â€™s). Any W. &
L,.. varsity player should be eligible. His full name,
year and position should be stated.

If this effort is approved by magazine readers the
plan will be republished in the summer issue of the

ALUMNI Macazine, which goes to all alumni, a set
of judges appointed and rules of entry defined. Let
the alumni secretary hear from you. .Should we
propose an All-Time baseball team, too?

 

ATHLETIC FIELD FENCED IN STEEL WIRE

A new steel fence, of the same type as that which
surrounds the athletic field at the University of Vir-
ginia and supported by steel posts set in concrete, now
encloses the entire athletic field, taking in the baseball
diamond, gridiron and stadium. It was bought at a
cost of $3,500.

There are six small gates at the regular entrance
on the south side of the field, and also several entrance
gates from the railroad side of the field.

No provision, however, has been made for parking
purposes on the field. Autoists will in the future be
compelled to park their machines in front of the gym
or on the streets of Lexington. The reason given is
that after the athletic field will have been completed
and sodded the destruction that autos would cause to

the field in wet weather would cause much damage.

It is the plan of the athletic association to eventu-
ally construct a concrete foot bridge across the railroad
gap that separates the athletic field from the gym-
nasuim. This improvement would greatly relieve the
crowded conditions that now exist when games are
played on Wilson field and the cars could then be parked
in front of the gymnasuim with no inconvenience to
the visitors.

 

GENERALS BEAT W. & M. RUNNERS

Washington and Leeâ€™s trackmen scored their first
victory of the spring season over the harriers from
William and Mary College by a 12 point margin, the
final score being 69-57. â€˜The Indians came from be-
hind in the last few events to seriously threaten a
seemingly safe lead which the Generals had accumu-
lated early in the match. The afternoon was replete
with spectacular individual performances.

The best individual performance of the day was
turned by Coleman of the Generals, who threw the
javelin 171 feet, eight inches. This mark came within
one inch of the old school record which was made by
J. O. Lewis in 1925. While failing to establish a new
school record at this time, Coleman bids fair to be-
come successful in breaking this and other records be-
fore the year is over.

 

Duke Universityâ€™s flimsily garbed gladiators raced
through the field events to a hard-earned victory over
the Washington and Lee spikers by a score of 75 to
51. The Generals about held their own in the running
events, but were unable to give the skilful Carolinians
much competition in the jumping and weight events.

â€œSuicideâ€ Has Not Changed

The football tactics of â€œSuicideâ€ as played in
Washington and Lee have not been lessened in six-
teen years of playing. Those who participate in this
rigorous sport in the gym today, feel the same as the
student who wrote an article concerning it in the Ring-
tum Phi of March 12, 1914. After writing a long
description of the manner in which the game was
played, he reports, â€œAs a visiting alumnus said last
week, â€œT'alk about the violence of football, the bloodi-
ness of German duels, the wildness of Mexican revo-
lutions, .... Great Scott, man! Go out to the gym
and see a game of W. & L. suicide.â€™ â€

The writer summed up his article with the follow-
ing paragraph:

â€œTâ€™ll shoot Niagaraâ€™s highest fall, but I wonâ€™t play
suicide basketball: Iâ€™ve been about a bit in my time,
when things were rough and wild, and Pd had my
share of dangers when I was but a child; Iâ€™ve been
pursued by Indians over many a trackless plain, and
Iâ€™ve seen some heavy firing in the memorable war
with Spain; Iâ€™ve broncho busted in the wooly West,
and Iâ€™ve sailed uncharted seas, Iâ€™ve withstood attacks
from bandits in the Spanish Pyrenees; Iâ€™ve been cap-
tured by cannibals in a far off South Isle, and Iâ€™ve

used the back of a crocodile to ferry across the Nile;
Iâ€™ve been in the revolutions of southern Argentine,
and Iâ€™ve been to the depths of the ocean in a punctured
submarine. â€˜These are a few of my numerous deeds
â€”I canâ€™t recall them all; but thereâ€™s just one thing I
will not doâ€”play suicide basketball.â€

â€œSuicideâ€ has taken its toll at Washington and Lee.
Strange to say, no death notice concerning any stu-
dent at the University can be found in the newspaper.
No one is dead. But â€œsuicideâ€ has taken its toll. In
collegiate circles â€œsuicideâ€ is not necessarily limited to
death imposed by oneâ€™s own hand, but it is a term more
generally applied to a modified form of basketball, in
which kicking, gouging, punching and fighting are all
allowable, and even to be desired.

As a result of one of these games, one student suf-
fered from a broken arm, another had two front teeth
knocked out, two more had broken noses, while cuts,
bruises and sprains are numerous.

Modern reformers are demanding that a stop be
put to the â€œsuicideâ€ wave among students, but they
admit.that they would have a real job on their hands
to convince a typical Washington and Lee man that
â€œsuicideâ€ isnâ€™t a great game.

 

 

ANOTHER W. & L. WORLDâ€™S RECORD

Dr. Matthew Page Andrews, â€™O1, of Baltimore,
Md., author, historian and baseball fan, has called
our attention to an article published in a New York
paper several years ago by Ernest J. Lannagan, which
stated that the Worldâ€™s record for the highest shut out
score was made by Washington and Lee in a game
with William and Mary. The score was 40-0. This
article was written ten years after the game was
played. The author had evidently been digging up
baseball statistics for publication and had gone through
college records as well as other amateur and profes-
sional records, so it can really be considered a worldâ€™s
record and regarded as official.

Another record of which W. & L,. may be proud is
that of Mr. Andrews pitching in 1901, which was
hung up at Sharpsburg, Md., against the Washington,
(D. C.) Y. M. Â©. A, team, iIn-this game Mr. An-
drews struck out 24 of the 27 men to face him during
the nine innings of play. This record has since been
equalled in an amateur game in Texas which is quoted
as a worldâ€™s record.

 

Representative H. St. George Tucker, â€™75, of the
Tenth Virginia district has accepted an invitation to
make the principal address before the State Bar As-
sociation of Georgia, at Savannah, June 2.

FORMER GENERALS IN PROFESSIONAL
BASEBALL

Tommy Seehorn, â€™26, former Generalsâ€™ baseball
star, signed up with the New Orleans â€˜Pelicansâ€
in the Southern League for the 1927 baseball sea-
son. After the training season he went to the Tampa,
Florida Association. â€˜There he is leading his club in
batting and is rapidly proving to be the outstanding
star of the League.

Seehorn played third base and short stop for
Washington and Lee, being captain of his team last
year. He was noted for his heavy hitting. After
graduating from W. & L. he played in the Tri-state
League, then returned to Memphis, Tennessee, to
play with the Chrysler Baseball Club.

Gus Lindburg, General pitching ace and captain
of the 1925 team, signed up with the Winston-Salem,
N. C., Baseball Club at the beginning of the season. |
He had previously had a try-out with the New York
Giants. |

 

Rev. Donald W. M. MacCluer, â€™07, pastor of the
Rose City Community Church in Portland, Oregon,
writes us: â€œFor the second year we have the larg-
est Sunday School in the state. But I have had
nothing to do with it. Our officers and teachers are
responsible.â€

â€œREDâ€ GILLIAM HAS VARIED ATHLETIC
EXPERIENCE

(From Ring-tum Pht)

There are many interesting persons and characters
connected with Washington and Lee. But how many
ever directed the life of a Harvard crew, managed
and played on a professional baseball team, and played
in an orchestra? Very few.

Yet â€œRedâ€ Gilliam, Iocal athletic trainer, has done
them all. ;

â€œRedâ€ was trainer at Harvard from 1899 to 1901.
His work was directed especially to the crew. During
his time at this historic institution â€œRedâ€ became ac-
quainted with all the outstanding athletics of the â€œBig
Threeâ€. When Bill Roper, a Princeton star, came to
V. M. I. to coach in 1902 he induced â€œRedâ€ to come
with him. The former Harvard Trainer resumed his
duties at V. M. I. for two years. However, he felt the
call of his old ambition, so in 1904 he signed to play
baseball with the Royal Giants of New York. He was
an outstanding catcher for this team until 1907 when
Dr. â€œLibâ€ Smith persuaded him to come back to Lex-
ington as trainer at W. & L. :

During his twenty-four years of service â€œRedâ€ has
served many Blue and White teams. When he came
to W. & L. a generation ago, the gym was where the
chemistry building is now. From the burning of that
gym to the reserved place under the Carnegie Library,
from that to the field house and from the field house
to the present Doremus gym, â€œRedâ€ has attended the
men who have been responsible for the athletic recog-
nition which Washington and Lee receives today.

During the summers for ten years after â€œRedâ€
came to Washington and Lee he continued to play
ball. When his day of baseball reached its climax
â€œRedâ€ devoted his time to other things. For the past
few summers he has managed the base-ball team at
White Sulphur Springs, West Va., and along with
his managership has played the banjo in the orchestra
of this well known resort.

nee

FIFTY YEARS AGO THE SAME THING
HAPPENED!

~W. & L. baseball players celebrated the golden an-
niversary of historic event this spring, when they beat
the University of Virginia by a score of 8 to 0. Fifty
years ago the score was 12 to O in favor of W. & L.
It was another spring day in April, 1877, when the
Blue and White â€œnineâ€ took the all-day trip to Staun-

ton, then by train to Charlottesville to cross bats with Â©

the University of Virginia â€œnineâ€ that had an idea
that W. & L. was pie. But there was a boy hereâ€”
Sykes by nameâ€”who came from old Rugby School in
Louisville along with McElwee; and Sykes had an

assortment of â€œcurvesâ€ in which the baseball funda-
mentalists didnâ€™t take any more stock than some folks
do these days in Evolution.

Washington and Lee watched and prayed; all Lex-
ington held its breath; then came the message ticking
over the wire that â€œweâ€ had shut â€™em out by a score
of 12 to O! The rest of the story was one of riotous
rejoicing and bon fires and when the boys got back, so
hoarse from shouting that they could not talk, how
they were feted and feasted!

 

SPOTTS ELECTED QUINT CAPTAIN

H. 8. Spotts, of Brooklyn, N. Y. was elected captain
of the 1928 basketball team at a banquet held at the
Dutch Inn for the basketball monogram then. â€œBabeâ€
is a member of the Phi Kappa Psi social fraternity,
â€œ13â€ Club, O. D. K., Cotillion Club, and Pi Alpha
Nu. :

Since entering the University in the fall of 1924
Spotts has made his monogram in football twice, -bas-
ketball twice and boxing once. Last season he was
one of the leading hitters on the baseball team, hitting
around the 320 mark. â€œBabeâ€ was the first all-tour-
nament center at the first annual prep basketball tour-
nament held under the auspices of Washington and
Lee. Before entering the University here he attended
Fishburne Military School. :

 

PHI BETA KAPPA INITIATES RECEIVE

Washington and Lee Phi Beta Kappa initiates re-
ceived their keys on Thursday evening, May 12th, at
the annual meeting and banquet at the Dutch Inn.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE 15

A Commencement Message from the President

To Our Most Loyal Alumni:

Were I to list only the gratifying items of our re-
cent history you might well infer that your Alma
Materâ€™s progress was a triumphal procession, with-
out handicaps, problems, deficits, or uncertainties.

Our alumni are in my judgment more united,
more interested, better informed, and more loyally
cooperative with the trustees and faculty than I have
ever known them.

Your institution seems to be more widely es-
teemed, more highly rated by official accrediting au-
thorities, and given wider and more favorable pub-
licity by more newspapers and telegraphic agencies
than ever before.

Its patronage today is more national, more insist-
ent, and more regularly in excess of the pre-deter-
mined limit of enrollment than ever in its history.

Its teaching force is much larger in number com-
pared with the enrollment, and is on the average bet-
ter trained and more highly educated than at any
time in recent years.

Recent notable additions, such as the chemical lab-
oratory, the new athletic field, the electrical engi-
neering laboratory, etc., have very much improved
its equipment.

Its library has been largely increased by notable
gifts, is much better catalogued than ever before,
and is utilized by three or four times as many stu-
dents every day. :

The entering students of the University are se-
lected from a larger list of applicants by a far more
rigid investigation than ever before, are now put
through a course of special assimilative training,
and are placed under expert psychological and voca-
tional advisers during their undergraduate course.

These are a selected group of the very favorabie
items in our recent history.

A few outstanding doubts, deficits, and handicaps
lay be mentioned as follows:

The annual number of students thus careluily se-
lected by the University which she fails to awaken,
assimilate, or successfully train, constituting the an-
nual ghastly scrap-heap of â€œcollege failures,â€™ seems

DR. LAING IS SPEAKER AT ASSEMBLY

Dr. Gordon J. Laing, Dean of the graduate school
at the University of Chicago, was the principal speaker
at the University assembly held recently in the gym.
His subject, â€œLiterature and Leisureâ€™, proved most
interesting and was well flavored with fine wit and
catching humor. Dr. Laing brought out in a forceful
manner that men should devote their leisure time to
accomplishing something which is not gained by at-
tending the movies and cheap shows. He said that
the forms of amusement now were just as detrimental
as the saloons had been.

The editor of the University of Chicago â€œPressâ€ dis-
cussed the study and writing of literature in our

leisure hours and showed that something beneficial

could be gained along this line. At the end of his
address, the student body gave Dr. Laing a great
ovation, expressing their true delight and enjoyment
of such an accomplished character.

Dr. Henry Louis Smith then requested each mem-
ber of the student body to write down, on blalnks pro-
vided for the purpose, the names of the four most
typical Washington and Lee men. â€˜The purpose of
this was to have all the students select the best ex-
ample of Washington and Lee man to whom a loving
cup will be presented, the plan for this being origi-
nated by a Washington and Lee alumnus. â€˜The award
will be made at Finals.

DR. FISHER OF YALE UNIVERSITY
ADDRESSES STUDENT ASSEMBLY

â€œA drunkard commits suicide morally if not phy-
sically,â€™ Dr. Irving Fisher, head of the Department
of Economics at Yale University, declared before an
assembly of the entire Washington and Lee Univer-
sity student body here. |

Dr. Fisher, who is known throughout the country
as an author, hygienist, and economist, spoke on the
subject: â€œThe Liquor Question as an American Prob-
lem.â€ 3

â€œThere are three classes of people as regards pro-
hibition,â€ Dr. Fisher pointed out. â€œFirst, there are
the fanatical dries who believe in prohibition on prin-
ciple whether it works or not; second, the fanatical
wets who are against prohibition on principle; and
third, the pragmatists who are in favor of any suc-
cessful plan for the good of the nation.

It is the latter class which is only able.to solve this
problem for in such a crisis a scientific or unbiased
mind is invaluable.

Dr. Fisher went on to show that prohibition to a
certain extent is a failure, in that it has caused. dis-

respect for law and has brought about corruption in

some places where it had not existed. â€œThe wets have
been prone to exaggerate this failure,â€™ he said, â€œfor-
getting the corruption of the saloon with its far greater
evil influence.

â€œThe disrespect for the law has shifted from the
poor to the rich, who in many instances openly defy
the law. It is only so-called â€˜smartâ€™ sets that drink
now who did not before prohibition.

â€œHighty-five percent of drinking has been abolished
by prohibition however, but this is yet a failing per-
centage.

â€œThere is no economic argument against prohibi-
tion as figures conclusively show that $6,000,000,000
has been saved annually by the Volstead Act.

â€œIt is the duty of the coming generation to solve this
unsettled question of prohibition with the knowledge
which the present generation can impart.â€

Judge Caffrey, 09, Promoted

As a result of the creation of two additional Cir-
cuit Court Judges, Governor Moore of New Jersey
named Judge Edwin C. Caffrey, â€™09, of the Court of
Common Pleas, Newark, N. J., to fill one of the po-
sitions. His appointment was immediately confirmed
by the State Senate.

Judge Caffrey was appointed to the Common Pleas
bench by Governor Edwards in 1921. It has often
been noted that two of the three judges of this court
were Washington and Lee alumni, the other being
Judge Dallas Flannagan, â€™88, of Montclair, N. J. In
May of last year Judge Caffrey was named by Gov-
ernor Moore as one of the commission to study crime
conditions in the state and make recommendations

As national president of the Washington and Lee
Alumni, Inc., Judge Caffrey is well known to every
Washington and Lee alumnus. He never misses a
Virginia game nor a Finals alumni reunion. Few can
match his actively loyal and liberal interest in his
alma mater. He has placed Washington and Lee on
the map in New Jersey, as was proven by the attend-
ance of twenty-four of his business friends at the
Virginia-W. & L. gridiron catastrophe in Charlottes-
ville last fall. Though none were alumni they char-
tered a private pullman and came down to root for
the Generals en masse.

In behalf of the entire alumni body the ALUMNI
MaGazINnE congratulates Judge Caffrey upon his well
deserved promotion to this field for greater public
service, upon this recognition of his professional abil-
ity, and upon the added glory he reflects to Washing-
ton and Lee.

the hardest times we have. had since coming here,
with the possible exception of a few hurricanes and
a few other bank failures. I am determined to stay
with them, however, because I have implicit faith
in the future development of this country. I have
charge of the above company in trying to keep the
outstanding contracts up to date and have a_ good
mortgage connection aside from my real estate and
insurance. â€˜That ought to keep me from starving
till things get better which I believe they will do this
summer. â€˜Things will be mighty cheap this sum-
mer and fall and it will be a buyersâ€™ market. I hate
to think of the poor devils who will have to  sacri-
fice their stuff to get eating money but that will be
exactly what will happen just as sure as there 1s a

the directors of the Lincoln National Bank and the

Lincoln Mortgage & Title Guaranty Company. Judge

Caffrey is vice president of the title pompany atic 2
director in each financial institution.

The dinner was held at the Newark Athletic Club.
The thirty-five diners sat at an oval table. In the
center was a fountain and in a pool were goldfish and
ducks. The walls were decorated with silk hangings.

The guests were Senator Edwards, who first named
Judge Caffrey to the bench; Vice Chancellor Berry,
District Court Judge Dillon, James Baker, president of
the State Board of Taxes and Assessment, and Cir-
cuit Court Judge Nelson Y. Dungan. Mr. Baker pre-
sented Judge Caffrey a silver tea service.

Senator Edwards declared that â€œJudge Caffreyâ€™s
success on the Common Pleas bench entitled: him to
his new position and unless I am mistaken he will
eventually go to the Supreme Court and then on to the
United States Supreme Court.â€

Hill Cemetery in Macon, Ga.

Flournoy was born in Richmond, Va., and in 1922
was given the Rhodes scholarship from this state. He
spent three years at Oxford and during that time was

on the boat crew, was in the famous Oxford union

training for debating, specialized in English literature,
and won a first place in the college on the subject, be-
ing the first American to win such a distinction in
fifteen years. |
When he returned to Aoi in 1925 he taught
English at Leland-Stanford University, in California.
He is now associate professor of English in Washing-

LOCAL PROFESSOR WINS ESSAY PRIZE

Dr. Albert Levitt of the Law school was awarded
the prize of $500 offered by Boni and Liveright, pub-
lishers of â€œThe American Tragedyâ€ by â€˜Theodore
Dreiser, for the best essay on the subject: â€œWas
Clyde guilty of murder in the first degree?â€™ The
trial and conviction of Griffith in â€œThe American -
Tragedyâ€ raised much pe ey throughout the
country.

The judges of the contest were thoroughly repre-
sentative. They were Arthur G. Hays, noted lawyer,
Bishop William Brown, and Heyward Broun, the
famous author and newspaper columnist.

Dr. Levitt approached the subject from these an-
gles: the law, Christian ethics, and society. He finally
came to the conclusion that from the point of view of
criminal law, Griffith was not guilty of first degree
murder, but that the jury was justified in giving their
decision from the facts presented by the prosecuting
attorney. According to Christian ethics Dr. Levitt
held that Griffith was guilty. Dr. Levitt considered
society altogether culpable for the crime, in that neither
Griffith nor his victim had received the proper educa-
tion to prevent the wrongs they committed. He stated
that such crimes were due to the failure of society to
educate youth concerning sex-relationship.

AN ALL-SOUTHERN JOURNALISM
ACTIVITY

~The Lee Memorial School of Journalism, though
established only two years ago, is the leader of journ-
alistic education in the South. During its first year,
able Journalism Professor R. B. Ellard formed the
Southern Interscholastic Press Association for the en-
couragement of high and preparatory school journal-
istic activity. A successful convention of this newly
formed association was held under Prof. Ellardâ€™s di-
rection.

Crippled by Mr. Ellardâ€™s serious illness and con-
sequent absence this year, the S. I. P. A. convention
was again held by the Lee School. One hundred del-
egates and faculty advisers representing ten Southern
states attended the meetings April 21, 22 and 23rd.
They came from Florida, Texas, Maryland, Kentucky,
etc. to submit their high school papers and annuals in
competition, to be criticised and judged. Forum dis-
cussions, lectures and a final banquet with prize
awards to highest grade entries made up the program.

To active, energetic, capable Howard M. Thomp-
son, assistant professor of Journalism, and his assist-
ants goes the praise for this yearâ€™s success. A former
student under Mr. Ellard at Beloit College, Mr.
Thompson came to Washington and Lee after two
years practical experience, as teaching assistant in the
rapidly expanding School of Journalism. Due to Mr.
Fllardâ€™s sudden illness he shouldered the entire re-
sponsibility of instruction and publicity for the year.
In addition, he promoted and conducted the annual
high and preparatory school convention with remark-
able skill and success. Delegates were prompt to ex-
press their appreciation for his work. We add our
full praise.

Prize awards for the convention were generously
donated as follows:

Kven to the bell-bottomed collegiate, the place

A recent survey of student living quarters at Wash-
ington and Lee University reveals that of the 927 men
enrolled in the entire school, 305 prefer rooms in pri-
vate residences.

After questioning the students divulge that in pri-
vate residences it is more quiet and hence more con-
ducive to study. A few will even admit the truthâ€”
that the private residence is more like the real homeâ€”
back in Podunk or maybe in New York.

The Washington and Lee Swing

(By J. R. Cask Ga.

Last November, at a meeting of the. Lynchburg
Alumni Association I gave a brief history of the Wash-
ing & Lee Swing, which has probably become the
most popular college song in America, and I have been
asked by the editor of the Alumni Magazine to write
it out for use in the Magazine.

As the talk was entirely ex tempore, it is, of course,
impossible for me to give anything like the identical
history which was given at that time. _

The Swing is the product of three Washington and
Lee students, attending the University at different
times. The air of the chorus originated with Mark
W. Sheaf, who was a law student from Watertown,
South Dakota. Mark was a natural born musician,
and is the only man I ever saw who could play a man-
dolin solo and make you like it. He sang in the Glee
Club and was director of what was then known as
the Mandolin and Guitar Club. He was also a splen-
did man, personally, and a high type student.

I think it was during the session of 1905-06 that he
picked out on his mandolin the air of â€œThe Swingâ€,
and taught it to the men of the Guitar Club, which
used it as an encore in their program. He called it
simply, â€œI'he Swingâ€, and as we all know, it has a
veritable swing. It has swept the country. I think
Mark graduated that year, and left for his home in
South Dakota; where he is now practicing law, or was
according to my last information.

In the fall of 1907, a committee was appointed to
get up songs for the annual V. P. I. Football game.
As it happened, I was song leader at the athletic con-
tests at that time. I do not recall now the other mem-
bers of the committee, with the exception of Ran
Bledsoe, now deceased, and who was not a musician
himself but had a retentive mind for tunes. In-
cidentally he had one of the brightest minds with
which I came in contract while in college. â€˜The com-
mittee posted a notice on the bulletin board, asking
that the student-body submit any songs which they
thought proper. â€˜Then we had a meeting and from
the various suggestions we culled probably four or
five for use. At that meeting, Ran Bledsoe suggested
that it would be well if we could get someone to put
words to â€œI'he Swingâ€™. It had been over a year since
Sheaf had left college, and I remember that when
Ran made the suggestion, though I had been in the
Glee Club and had heard all the mandolin and guitar
music, as the two generally went together, I had no
recollection whatever of â€œThe Swingâ€ and did not
know what the tune was. Ran hummed it over, and
I immediately recognized it. We looked around for
someone to write the words, and finally hit on C. A.
Robbins, from Brooklyn, N. Y., generally known as

 

 

J. Re Casere. 06
First to sing â€œThe Swingâ€

 

 

â€œod . [le was quite a. character, and one who did
not feel impelled to do a great amount of study, and
yet who had an unusually bright mind, and a literary
turn. â€˜Tod, though a small man, had the best devel-
oped shoulders and arms I have ever seen. He was
a member of the track team and specialized in the
pole vault. â€˜Tod composed the words for the chorus,
as they exist to day, with the exception of the some-
what profane interpolation which we often hear and
which in my opinion, puts a discordant and improper
note in the song. â€˜â€œlâ€™odâ€ Robbins is now known for
his writings and scenarios. Probably his best known
scenario is â€œThe Unholy Threeâ€™. I have heard that
he is now a producer of moving pictures, being head
of the â€œTod Browningâ€ Production Company. Doubt-
less Tod Browning is his â€œstage nameâ€™â€™, though I can-

not vouch for the fact.

After we had collected the songs, including â€˜The
Swingâ€™, we had the words for the various songs
printed on a little folder for distribution among the
students, and held several rehearsals at which the
songs could be learned by the student-body. â€˜The
Swingâ€™ immediately became immensely popular, and
has remained so to this day. A curious coincidence is

Ae THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

that a short time thereafter I sent one of these folders
to Mark Sheaf, telling him that he would be pleased
to know that his song was being perpetuated. He
wrote back, thanking me for it, but stating that he had
not thought of â€œThe Swingâ€™ since he left college, and
could not remember how it went.

What now came to be known as Washington &
Lee swing was adopted as the official athletic song of
the University, merely the chorus part. Being a lively
air, it spread rapidly and was used by numerous pre-
paratory schools and colleges.

About 1906, I think it was, Thornton W. Allen of
Newark, New Jersey, entered the University. He
was a musical genius, directed the band, the orchestra
and was a member of: the Glee Club. He was also
a composer. During his stay in the University, (he
graduated in 1910) he took hold of â€œThe Swingâ€ and
wrote both the words and music for the verses, fitting
them into the original and established chorus. I did
not know Allen personally, but I have often been told
that he could play any instrument in either the band
or orchestra better than the regular man on the instru-
ment, and that in fact he could pick up any musical
instrument and play it. Allen then had the complete
â€œWashington & Lee Swingâ€ copyrighted for the ben-
efit of the University. I understand he is now the
managing editor of â€œThe Musical Courierâ€™, New
York City, and has composed and issued numerous
songs. Music is his profession.

From that time to this, â€œIhe Washington & Lee
Swingâ€™â€™ has been â€˜the official student song, and has in-
deed gripped the student-body from the time it was

first tried out in the fall of 1907 at the football games.

Since I was song-leader at that time, I had the pleas-
ure of leading the chorus part the first time it was
ever tried out. I am frank to say I do not think I
was a very efficient leader, and when I go back to col-
lege now, and see how they do these things, I can
appreciate how wonderfully inefficient I was.

As stated in the beginning. â€œThe Washington &
Lee Swingâ€ is probably the most popular college song
in America and, therefore, in the world. It has swept
the country and is used by orchestras everywhere. It
is sung by boys and girls over the country and in
traveling around, I hear it in the most unexpected
places. The air has been adopted by any number of

preparatory schools and colleges, which at times has

caused some complications since the song is copy-
righted. Some controversy was had with Tulane Uni-
versity and the University of Alabama, who put
words of their own to the music and called it respec-
tively â€œThe Tulane Swingâ€ and â€œThe Alabama Swing.â€
Our understanding is that neither Allen, who copy-
righted the song, nor the University has ever objected
to any other college or school using it, except they do
specify and require that the name shall not be changed

 

and that wherever used, it must be known and desig-
nated as â€œThe Washington & Lee Swingâ€™â€™. For a while,
I understand, both Tulane and Alabama claimed that
the song was originated with them, and I know of one
instance where a preparatory school claimed that it
was originated with them. After some correspond-
ence and trouble, both Tulane and Alabama were
finally convinced that they were infringing on a copy-
right song, and when this was realized, they both
cheerfully admitted their error and ceased to use the
song under any other name than its correct name.
Various orchestras throughout the country likewise
use it under its proper name. During the war, it was
used as the official marching song of Camp Sherman,
much to the delight of Bob McDougle and the other
Washington & Lee men, who were at that camp. It
was used in France and, in fact, wherever you go and
hear much lively music the program is seldom com-
pleted without playing â€œThe Washington & Lee
Swing.â€

Being entirely the product of the Washington &
Lee students, and of unprecedented popularity as a
college song, the Alumni and students of Washing-
ton & Lee have a right to be proud of it and to guard
it jealously in its integrity as a Washington & Lee
song, while at the same time being generous in allow-
ing others to use it. | 7

It is a wonderful air and one that stirs the blood,
and so is an ideal athletic song. Personally, I have
never felt that it is proper to use it as the official song
on the playing of which the audience rises and heads
are uncovered. The whole spirit of the song is ath-
letic, and, therefore, not dignified and not intended as
such. The idea of reverence and dignity is incon-
gruous in connection with this song. It is wonderful
for the purpose for which it was intended, and will
probably go down through the years as a heritage and
tradition of the school; at the: same time, it would
seem that there should be a more dignified and more
solemn song or hymn to call forth the rising of the
student-body and the baring of heads.

I trust that the future will bring about this condi-
tion. Several attempts have been made but so far,
apparently nothing has been found to answer the pur-

pose to the satisfaction of the successive student-
bodies.

The Richmond Alumni of Washington and Lee
University, at their meeting of February 26, 1927,
organized the Washington and Lee Club of the City
of Richmond. â€˜The former association of the Alumni
was discontinued. The meeting was largely attended.

C. H. Morrissett, â€™14, was elected president of the
club; C. H. Moss, â€™18, vice-president, and O. M.
Stumpf, â€™16, secretary. It is the purpose of the first
president of the club to exert his best efforts to
make the first year of its life healthy and _ strong.
Within a short while the first meeting of the club
since its organization will be held, and thereafter
quarterly meetings. It is the purpose of the presi-
dent to make these meetings interesting and attrac-
tive enough to draw large and enthusiastic attendance.

C. H. Morrissett has been State Tax Commis-
sioner for the past year. Graduating in law at
Washington and Lee in 1914, he was a_ substitute
teacher in the law school in 1915, and a teacher in
the summer law school in 1916. He revised the
notes of the official Code of Virginia of 1919 (1914-
1919) ; edited the Second Edition of Burks Pleading
and Practice in Actions at Common Law (1921),
and edited General Laws of Virginia (1923). He
is the author of â€œNotes on Statutes Subsequent to
the Code of 1919â€ (1921); the draftsman of ap-
proximately 4,200 legislative bills, a majority of
which have been enacted into law, and the author of
several published addresses before bar associations.
From June, 1919 to April, 1926, he was Director of
the State Legislative Reference Bureau. He has
practised in both trial and appellate courts. He was
a member and secretary of the Childrenâ€™s Code Com-

RECUMBENT STATUE OF LEE CONSID-
ERED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
IN VIRGINIA

What is the most beautiful thing in Virginia? Some
will say the lawn at the University of Virginia by
moonlight. Others will say Goshen Pass when the
laurel is in bloom. Others, the valley from Afton
mountain. Others, the sight of Balcony Falls from the
mountain heights. Othersâ€”there are hundreds of
possible answers. But few who know will deny that
among the most beautiful things in Virginia isâ€”the
recumbent Lee at Washington and Lee University.
Stately in its white calm, majestic in its eternal peace,
almost holy in its everlasting rest, the Valentine statue
of Lee is so nearly sublime that the first sight of it
catches at the throat and causes the eyes to smart.

Above the body of Lee it liesâ€”in the little chapel
built when Lee was president of Washington College.

In that chapel, too, is the office of Lee. â€˜There those
who see where he worked in peace during the last
days of his exalted life, those who reverently look
upon the chamber where his body is entombed, and
those who stand before the wondrous marble of Lee
in lasting sleepâ€”all these must sense, as nowhere else
on eatth, the very spirit of Lee.

DR. ROBERT P. COOKE, â€™92, HEALTH
OFFICER, LAUDED IN CONGRESS AS
YELLOW FEVER HERO

R. M. Lynn, a well known correspondent, writes as
follows from Washington, Feb. 23rd, to Virginia
papers: :

In favorably reporting the bill of Representative
Harrison granting an annuity of $100 a month to Dr.
Robert P. Cooke, 92 of Virginia, for disabilities con-
tracted by him while assisting in Dr. Walter Reedâ€™s
yellow fever experiments, the military affairs commit-
tee caused to be printed a twenty-four page report.

It is the record of the heroism of the physicians and
others who risked their lives to conquer â€˜Yellow
Jack,â€ with passages of thrilling interest. â€”

Dr. Cooke, who is a son of the late John Esten
Cooke, â€™67 Virginia historian and writer of novels of
the Civil war period, volunteered in 1900 to assist
Dr. Reed in his experiments in Cuba.

Two buildings were built, one for experiments with
infected bedding and clothing and one for infected
mosquitoes. Dr. Cooke was one of several volunteers
who agreed to enter the first building containing bed-
ding and clothing from the yellow fever wards of Les
Animas hospital, Havana. This house was constructed
with a minimum of ventilation and kept at a max-
imum temperature to duplicate as far as possible the

conditions under which the disease was most apt to

occur. It was very carefully screened against mos-
quitoes.

Dr. Cooke and the other volunteers, during a period
of three weeks, were required to enter this building
shortly after dark each evening and remain until
morning, to unpack large boxes of soiled bedding and
clothing sent from the yellow fever wards of the hos-
pital, to hand them around the room and place them on
the beds. Later on some slept in the pajamas soiled
with black vomit of persons who had died of the dis-
ease in Havana. None suffered any ill effects at the
time. â€”

Concurrent with this experiment, other men were
being bitten by infected mosquitoes in the other build-
ing, which was especially constructed for that purpose

and clean and well ventilated and located at a distance

from any other known source of infection. Here it
was conclusively demonstrated that the bite of the
mosquito was the cause of yellow fever.

In recommending the bill granting Dr. Cooke an
annuity, the report says:

â€œIn our judgment, these heroes of the fight against
yellow fever are entitled to the everlasting gratitude
of the people of this republic and that gratitude should
be shown not only by honoring their memories in

print and the spoken words, but by a substantial rec- _

ognition of our obligation to assist in the support of
their dependent loved ones, and, for that reason, we

respectfully urge the passage of the pending bill in
favor of Dr. Robert P. Cooke.â€

 

-W. H. WINFREE, â€™90

There is stored away today in a fireproof, moth- -

proof, waterproof vault of steel and concrete a mo-
tion picture-filmed record of every instrument filed
with the auditor of King County, Seattle, Washing-
ton. It is the first film-preserved record of its kind
in the world, and a revolutionary move in the economy
of space, patience and time when one goes about es-
tablishing chain of title to any property he may wish
to acquire. |

The King County Title Company, of which W. H.
Winfree, 90, is president, has made this film record.
Formerly head of the North-western Title Insurance
Company, of Spokane, Washington, Mr. Winfree is
now a resident of Seattle, where work of the King
County Title Company was begun May, 24, 1926. The
history of this move and of the new way of doing
things in the matter of tracing title was given the other
day by Mr. Winfree in an address before the King
County Bar Association.

In any system theretofore used for compiling rec-
ords for the purpose of indexing property in pursu-
ance of tracing title, it would have required three and
a half years for completing the books of the newcomer
company to King County. Under the current system
the records would have to be taken off on slips. There
would have been 3,000,000 slips necessary in this in-
stance. Each is handled about nine times, an aggre-
gate handling 27,000,000 times. The motion picture
plan has never been tried before. It is now an ac-
complished fact. The work of photographing the rec-
ord books and of indexing from the projected films
has been in charge of an associate of Mr. Winfree for
a number of years.

In tracing title to property under this Made-in-
Seattle system, which is expected to revolutionize
title company indexing is found, first, through the
tract runs until the desired reels are spotted, when
they are taken to the projection room and a picture
of the entire title is thrown on the screen. One turn
of the ratchet on the projecting machine flashes off
thirteen pages. An expert can arrive at the desired
page of the filmed record in a little less than nothing
flat.

â€œNow that the work is done,â€™ said Mr. Winfree
yesterday, â€œCarl Lundberg and I feel like tackling a
similar undertaking somewhere else. It has been a
most fascinating work and Carl has discovered sev-
eral improvements to his system which he would like
to try elsewhere.â€

O. H. Breidenbach, â€™11, has recently been promoted
to the position of Vice President and Bond Officer of
the Palm Beach Guaranty Company, of West Palm
Beach, Florida.

This company, a very strong and prominent mort-
gage bank-institution in Florida, with a capital of $1,-
500,000, is engaged in making mortgage loans secured
by improved city property of all types. Mr. Breiden-
bach first became associated with the Palm Beach
Guaranty Company two years ago as Treasurer and
Bond Officer in charge of advertising and sales or-
ganization, which organization he will continue to di-
rect. He is also Treasurer of the Mortgage Invest-
ment Company, another company of the Palm
Beaches. .

After leaving W. & L. Mr. Breidenbach was for
several years in public school work as city superin-
tendent of various school organizations. Later he

studied and practiced public accounting and for a.

while was financial secretary to Tulane University.

He then became associated with a prominent mort-

gage banking institution of New Orleans in charge of
advertising and selling organizations.

He is a graduate of the American Institute of Bank-
ing. . Several articles on financial subjects written by
him have been published by the Southern Banker.

While at Washington and Lee Mr. Breidenbach, as
a student, won several scholarships. He was a cross-

PAYING UPâ€”-A NON-ALUMNUS

December 11, 1926.
Dear Mr. Penick:

I enclose herewith check for $250.00 which, ac-
cording to my records, pays the balance in full of
my subscription of $1,000.00 to Washington and Lee
University.

It has been a pleasure to make this little contribu-
tion to so fine an institution representing, as it does,
two of the greatest characters in American history.

Whenever I think of Washington and Lee Uni-

versity, I am reminded that George Washington

served his country through the long periods of the

Revolutionary War, absolutely without compensation

and, in fact, advanced all of his own expenses
through the period of the War with the understand-
ing that he would be reimbursed when our independ-
ence was fully established and the Nation should be-
come able to reimburse him for his outlay.

I am reminded also that at the close of the Civil
War General Lee declined numerous offers which
carried handsome remunerations which would have
made him comfortable and independent for life, with

the simple statement that he did not feel that he
could render any service commensurate with the
compensation offered but when the Presidency of
Washington College was offered him, he accepted it
because, as he stated, he felt that in that position he
could render some service to the young men of the
South. His constructive work and noble example
has borne an abundant harvest, and I am quite sure
that those who are following in his foot-steps now
at Washington and Lee will continue the great work

which he carried on so successfully there.

With kindest regards and best wishes for the con-
tinued success of Washington and Lee University, I
am

Yours very truly,

T. B. Gay.

W. H. MASON, â€™96, INVENTS WOOD FIBRE
PROCESS

Recent advertisements appearing in leading maga-
zines announced the invention and marketing of
â€˜â€œMasonite,â€ a new wood fibre insulating board. In-
vestigation proved that W. H. Mason, â€™96 was the in-
ventor of this new manufacturing process which uti-
lizes waste lumber, chips, scraps, etc., by converting

them into a hard â€œpresdwoodâ€â€™ or a smooth surface in-

sulating building material. Mr. Mason is vice-president
and general manager of the company which is now
engaged in manufacturing and marketing the products
of his process.

In an interesting paper presented at the annual con-
vention of the Technical Association of the pulp and
paper industry in New York, February 22-24, Mr.
Mason explained his method. Wood chips and other
saw mill waste materials are exploded from steel guns
by high steam pressure. A long fibre wood pulp is
the result. Under pressure at a predetermined tem-
perature the fibres are rewelded to form a hard thin
pressed wood. A variation of temperature and pres-
sure produces â€œMasonite,â€ a thicker board with a
hard compact surface, but high insulating qualities pre-
served in the central mass.

William Horatio Mason came to W. & L, from
Lewisburg, West Va. in 1895.
Cornell University, became Superintendent of the
Edison Cement Works, Stuartsville, N. J., entered the

AMOS L. HEROLD, â€™09, â€™12, WRITES BOOK*

The Columbia University Press has just published
a biography on James Kirke Paulding, by Amos. L.
Herold, B.A. â€™09, M.A. 712, Head of the English
Department of the University of Tulsa, Tulsa, Ok-
lahoma. â€˜The book is listed as the critical biography
of the versatile American who was the chief Dutch
interpreter of the New York Dutch and who became
Secretary of the Navy in President Van Burenâ€™s
cabinet. A background view is presented of the
political, social and literary world of early New
York. This background is so deftly sketched as to
make the book an outstanding piece of literature
aside from the genesis, character and doings of Mr.
Paulding.

The author, Mr. Herold, entered Washington and
Lee from West Virginia in 1905, joined the Alpha
Chi Rho fraternity and received his B.A. in â€™09.
He returned in 1911-12 to take work for his mas-
terâ€™s degree. In the interim he taught at various
prep schools and took graduate work in English at

pect to be back for this anniversary and I hope every
man in our class will return this once, if no more.â€

Why not have a reunion of the W. & L. Ambu-
lance Unit this year? And of the other â€˜17 classes?
One is carried back ten years to the time when the
campus looked like an army camp and the athletic
field a parade ground. Captain Manning, â€™92, drilled
student battalions, a special ambulance unit was
formed, cap and gown were discarded for the army
blouse, Clovis Moomaw went, Dave Noble went, ev-
ery student over age joined the exodus. Some re-
turned. â€œBobâ€ Kane sounds a call to men of 17 to
reunite on the campus once more.

Since his graduation from Washington and Lee in
1916, Mr. Page has been practicing law in Norfolk,
Virginia, with the firm of Page, Page & Page, which
consists of his father, Ivor A. Page, Sr., who was
president of the Norfolk & Portsmouth Bar Associa-
tion last year; his brother, Reginald J. B. Page, of
the Class of 1911, who is Associate Justice of the
Civil Court of the City of Norfolk, and another
brother, Ivor A. Page, Jr., of the Class of 1910, who
is a former member of the State Legislature, having
served in the House in the session of 1922.

Mr. Page has served in the House of Delegates
for three sessions; we will not attempt to enumerate
the happenings in the Legislature during his time in
office as our readers are possibly familiar with those
things of interest which he has taken part in, having
gotten same through the press. â€œIt is my intention,â€
he writes, â€œto stand for re-nomination in the coming
primary.â€

FROM THE FACULTY TO STUDENTS AND
ALUMNI

Drinking, as every one knows, constitutes one of
the serious problems in the United States today. A
college community, which is only a cross-section of
our national life, furnishes no exception. The prob-
lem exists always in an intensified form at Com-
mencement, and the authorities of an institution are
constantly confronted with the difficulty of coping
with it at such a time.

Washington and Lee, as she is facing such an occa-
sion in the near future, appeals to her alumni and to
her students on the campus to exercise that self-re-
straint which is the marked characteristic of a gentle-
man, so that our Commencement season may be a
dignified and enjoyable one, worthy of the traditions
of her founders. General Robert FE. Lee said, â€œMy
experience through life has convinced me that while
moderation and temperance in all things are commend-
able and beneficial, abstinence from spirituous liquors
is the best safeguard to morals and health.â€

The alumni especially wield a powerful influence
over undergraduates, both in precept and example,
and we request that they recognize their responsibility
in this matter and the distinct service they can thus
render their Alma Mater.

Before an audience of 500 people the Washington
and Lee debating team, composed of H. M. Platt, C.
B. Carr and W. A. Plumer, lost a hard-fought debate
to Georgetown University in Washington, D. C., by a
judgeâ€™s decision of four to one.

WALTER EDWARD HARRIS, â€™92

Dr. E. Pendleton Topkins, â€™88, entertained his boy-
hood friend Walter Edward Harris, 92, and Mrs. Har-
ris, who motored up to Lexington from Petersburg to
see their brother Mr. William O. Harris, who has been
in the Jackson Hospital for some time.

Walter Edward Harris, who is a veteran Wash-
ington newspaper correspondent, and now the brilliant
editor of the afternoon and Sunday Progress-Index
of Petersburg, was graduated in law at Washington
and Lee about twenty-five years ago, with the highest
mark in constitutional law ever made in this school.
Harris also won the Santini medal. Mr. and Mrs.
Harris left on Wednesday morning for a trip down
the Valley to visit New Market and other points of
interest. :

Dear Kemp:

Thanks for your note and the prompt delivery of
the Alumni Directory which is excellent. I have been
at the Pittsburgh Station of the U. S. Bureau of Mines
four years engaged in research work, upon coal and
coke for the most part. I have continued my studies
in chemistry at Pitt and Carnegie Tech. Married Miss
Mable Abbott of this city about a year ago. Our home
is open to any W. & L. travelers who happen this way,
much more open than were the doors of â€œye ole kemikal

Nashville, Tenn., March 28, 1927.
Dear Mr. Kemp:

Your kind note of the 26th requesting my permis-
sion to publish in the next issue of the Alumni Maga-
zine a recent letter of mine to President Smith, has
just been received. Replying I say â€œYes, of course,â€
if you deem it of interest. My letter to him was one
of transmission of an article on the Southâ€™s produc-
tion of cold steel. I kept no copy and cannot recall
what I said outside of this but, ten to one, it over-
flowed with some emotional things which I never can
repress when writing about that dear town wherein |
spent so many happy days. If you are a student I just
must ask you one question. Are the girls there now
as charming as those who were there a short while ago
in â€™67 and 68? May be so, if they are their daughters,
though you may remember that Milton describes Eve
as being fairer than her daughters, and Milton â€œwas
an honorable man.â€™ My companion and I had our
room over a lawyerâ€™s office in the Court House yard,
though we stayed so long after meals at Dr. Waddellâ€™s
that we may be said to have lived at his home. You
may guess that it was because Misses Martha, Maria,
Edmonia, and Nettie Waddell lived there also. Well
you have my room-mates number but not mine. He
had, I admit, abundant cause, but my duty of keeping
the students of Washington and Lee and the cadets of
the V. M. I. on friendly terms, rendered my presence
near the dividing line necessary in the evenings and
my love for music carried me there in the mornings
and so I had no time to stay at home. Besides Prof.
Carter J. Harris, of blessed memory, was always so
inquisitiveâ€”I had to pass by his home in going to the
V. M. I. and he always wanted to know why I couldnâ€™t
gratify my musical love with the sweet notes of Ciceroâ€™s
ringing voice when he spoke for the past archives. He
tried to point these out to me, but his points posted
on those big columns in front were not exactly what
â€œthe old folks at homeâ€ wanted. Iâ€™m coming back some
of these days and will leave at home my copy of
Fiolmesâ€™ poem, â€œthe Last: leat.â€ â€œdis a sad kind of
thing and I donâ€™t want to find it true in my case.

Sincerely,
RoBert EWING, â€™68.

OBITUARY

Judge Waller Redd Staples, a prominent member
of the Roanoke bar, died in April at his home near
Hollins. Having been in bad health for some months,
he finally succumbed to an attack of influenza and
pneumonia. Judge Staples was educated at Wash-
ington and Lee and Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and was a brother of the late Abram P.

Staples of the University faculty. He always kept
up a pleasant association with Lexington where his

death is learned with sorrow by friends.

Israel Moore, 764, died on March 28th at his home
in Lynchburg, Virginia, at the age of eighty years.
He attended Washington and Lee for the session of
1863-64. When southern boys from seventeen to
eighteen years old were called to the Confederate
army, Mr. Moore enlisted and saw active service
around High Bridge. In 1865 he secured a trans-
fer to Jacksonâ€™s horse artillery, but the surrender
prevented him from seeing service with this regi-
ment. After the war he returned to Washington

College, where he received his degree, being a stu-

dent for two years while General Lee was president.

Joseph FE. Cockrell, â€™82, who was a classmate of
Dean Campbell, died in Dallas, Texas on April 3th,
after a surgical operation.

Thomas Campbell Wilson, â€™03, died on May 4th at

Salem, Virginia, with tuberculosis. He was a student
at Washington and Lee for seven years, receiving his
A. B. in 1903 and thereafter studying for three years
in the Law School. Particularly gifted in oratory,
he won the Society Oratorâ€™s Medal in 1902, and the
Cincinnati Oratorâ€™s Medal in 1903. For the past fif-
teen years Mr. Wilson has been engaged in the prac-

tice of law in Oklahoma, where he became a recognized

authority on Indian land titles.

JOHN L. CAMPBELL, â€™11, MAKES GOLF
HOLE IN ONE

The unusual and rare feat of making a hole in one
stroke was accomplished recently on the Lexington
golf course by John L. Campbell, one of the directors
of the club. The ball driven from the third tee on a
hole about 175 yards long, trickled up to the hole and
lay against the flag staff when Mr. Campbell and his
associates came to the green. The hole is a blind one.

Players, it has been said, usually give up the game
when they have made a perfect score, for there is
nothing more to be accomplished. Mr. Campbell,
however, intends to keep on until he has made the
nine hole course in nine strokes, which will give him
probably several more years on the links.

WEDDING BELLS

Dr. Samuel Brown McPheeters, â€™00, of Charlotte,
N. C., was recently married in Columbia, S. C., to

A REAL SUPPORTER

Portland, Oregon,
April 21, 1927.
My dear Mr. Kemp:

Enclosed you will please find my check for $4.00
for my subscription to the Washington and Lee
Alumni Magazine for two years.

I believe that your magazine is one of the finest
pieces of publicity in the country. It certainly does
bring back old memories, and stirs up not only loyalty
but enthusiasm for the university.

'Everything is moving along nicely in the North-
west, and any time you are out this way would like
to have you look us up. I remember with great pleas-
ure the privilege I had of meeting you when I was
back at Commencement last spring.

With best wishes, I remain,

Most cordially yours,
DonaLp W. M. MacCriuer, 707.

Recent Books Worth Owning

(Grateful acknowledgment to Miss Blanche Mc-
Crum, Librarian.)

During the year 1926, the publishing companies of
the United States produced 9,925 bound volumes. Of
these 7,549 were by American authors and the re-
mainder by British and other foreign writers. When
these books came from the press they were launched
on the market by the most skilful of advertising; for
publishers along with other mortals must earn money
in order to live. Not only were these books written
up by specialists paid to do such work, but they were
also treated as news items by various newspapers
which were not at all concerned with their intrinsic
value as literature. It therefore becomes a very hard
ptoblem for any reader, however intelligent, to weed
out from such a mass of publicity the notices of the
relatively few books that belong to him as an indi-
vidual by divine right. As an answer to what may be
a need felt by some old Washington and Lee men,
their college library has complied from its accessories
of the past twelve months the following list of books
recommended for reading or purchase. No claim of
inclusiveness is made for this list; nor will the critic
necessarily find there his favorite volume. But it
does represent a balanced ration selected at first hand
and indorsed by readers who have found rather un-
usual stimulation and pleasure in the titles that ap-
pear here. Inquiries about these books and requests to
borrow them will be welcomed.

BEACH, JOSEPH W. Outlook for American Prose,
Unwersity of Chicago Press, 1926, $2.50.

A vivid collection of essays on controversial points
in contemporary American literature by a man who
has not allowed his enthusiasm to submerge his criti-
cal faculty. Excellent for discriminating appraisal of
such men as Theodore Dreiser and Sherwood Ander-
son.

BIRKENHEAD, FREDERICK, 1st. earl. Famous
Trials of History, Doran, 1926.

Fugene Aram, Crippen and the like live again in
these pages from the pen of one of the most distin-
guished criminal lawyers of England. Notable alike
for literary style and for content.

BOWERS, CLAUDE G.
Houghton, 1925, $5.
Called by one of our History faculty â€œThe out-
standing historical work of the year,â€™ but dear to
many laymen for its lively delineations of men and
manners in the spacious days of the early Republic, as
well as for the best discussion they have ever found of
the foundation on which American democracy rests.

Jefferson and Hamilton,

BRADFORD, GAMALIEL. Darwin,
1926, $3.50.

This does not supplant the two volume Life and
Letters of Charles Darwin, edited by his son Francis,
which remains the classic for the student. But it does
give with much insight and sympathy Darwinâ€™s true
place in the history of the theory of evolution, and it
is written with the felicity and charm that one ex-
pects of the author of Lee and American.

Houghton,

BROMFIELD,
1926, $2.

William Dean Howells is reported to have said
something to the effect that certain kinds of fiction
are written for us only â€œwhen we are sick or when we
are silly.â€ Early Autumn can stand the test of our
best moments and then lead us back with eagerness to
the other volumes by this gifted young American.

LOUIS. Early Autumn, Stokes,

BROWN, ROLLO W. Dean Briggs, Harper, 1926,
$3.50.

Too fine an appreciation of a fine man to be ade-
quately criticized in a few lines. Humor, sympathy
and good writing make this tribute of an old Har-
vard man to his Dean one of the best biographies of
recent years.

DORSEY, GEORGE A. Why we Behave Like Be-
mgs, Harper, 1925, $3.50. |
The author has selected certain vital points in such
sciences as anthropology, biology and psychology and
with amazing success has used them to explain man to
himself.

DREISER, THEODORE. An American Tragedy,)
Bom and Liveright, 1926, $5.

The Yeas and Nays continue to struggle to have it
where these two large volumes are concerned. â€˜T'o
one type of mind it is a penetrating analysis of certain
underlying evils in our American life to-day, so epic
in its scope as to rank with the great tragedies of this
and other ages. An equally right-minded section of
the reading public considers it a wordy and sordid ex-
ample of the unnecessary in fiction, written in awkward
English and without distinction to redeem it. Because
of these diverse opinions the person with a literary
curiosity can hardly afford to ignore it.

DRINKWATER, JOHN. Pilgrim of Eternity,
Byron, a Conflict, Doran, 1925, SO.

Byron emerges from this new study neither glori-
fied nor damned, but more than ever the eternally ro-
mantic idol-breaker, whose ageless charm has never
been portrayed better than in these pages.

 

 

32 THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

DURANT, WILL. The Story of Philosophy, Simon,
1926, $5.

A successful attempt to present in language intelli-
gible to the average reader the principal contributions
to thought made by the great philosophers from Plato
to John Dewey. The book escapes the profound and
dull as successfully as it does the slight and superfi-
cial; and it links the ancient origins of ideas to their
present manifestations in a truly exciting way.

GLASGOW, ELLEN. Romatic Comedians, Dou-
bleday 1926, $2.50.

For a sophisticated sense of humor and for the
reader who cares more for types than for individuals,
this book showing the Old South at grips with the
New will be a genuine joy.

JONES, RUFUS M. The Churchâ€™s Debt to Here-
tics, Doran, 1924, $2.

Presents the idea that the heretic of to-day is often
the hero and reformer of to-morrow, using as illus-
trations such names as Origen and Martin Luther.
An interesting book for the student of Modernism and
Fundamentalism.

DE KRUIF, PAUL. Microbe Hunters, Harcourt,
1926, $3.50.

Adventures on the frontiers of science where such
men as Pasteur, Metchnikoff, Bruce and Koch have
met the invisible enemies of man and have defeated
them.

LEGOUIS, EMILE. History of English Literature,
Macmillan, 1926, $3.75.

Does for its own field what Reinchâ€™s Apollo does
for the field of Art,â€”provides a handbook in which
brevity and scholarship are very fortunately com-
bined. â€˜The author shows the pageant of English lit-
erature seen through the eyes of a student and writ-
ten with the taste and discrimination of a man of let-
ters. The first volume is now in print and volume
two, soon to appear, will complete the survey which
is to cover a period beginning with the year 650 and
ending with modern times: Excellent bibliographical
notes are included.

MEAD, MARCIA. Homes of Character,
1926 $3.50.

A successful effort to link the small house, its set-
ting and its furnishing into a harmonious whole
worthy of the best American tradition in architecture.
A valuable book for prospective builders, containing
a few good plans and illustrations.

LUDWIG, EMIL. William Hohengzollern, Putnam,
1927, $5. | :

By the author of â€œNapoleon,â€ which was a recent

Dodd,

|
|
i

Book of the Month. Our professor of European his-
tory considers this a brilliant book, of particular value
in that it gives much new light on one of the most 1m-
portant figures in a momentous scene of world his-
tory.

MIMS, EDWIN. The Advancing South, Double-
day, 1926, $3. .

While one regrets the Rotarian character of the
determined enthusiasm with which this book is writ-
ten, it nevertheless remains the only effort so far
made to assemble and discuss the most illuminating
facts in Southern life to-day. One reviewer says:
â€œTo paraphrase John Sharp Williamâ€™s reflection, it
invites everybody to curse less and think more.â€

POTEAT, WILLIAM L. Cana Man Be a Christ-
tan Today? University of North Carolina Press,
1925, 31.50.

By the President of Wake Forest College, and ori-
ginally delivered as lectures at the University of
North Carolina on the John Calvin McNair founda-
tion. The dedication of the book shows its temper:
â€œTo my children . . and all who share youth and
intelligence.â€â€™ One of the best recent discussions of
the conflict between the material and the spiritual in
the universe. :

RUSSELL, BERTRAND. Education and the Good
Life, Bont and Liveright, 1926, $2.50.

Not ony an important document for parents with
young children to bring up but also the presentation
of a philosophy of life based on courage, vigor and
co-operation as opposed to fear, denial and competi-
tion. The radical social theories which it advances
may detract from it for some people, but it remains
one of the most thought-provoking. books of the year.

SULLIVAN, MARK. Our Times, Scribner, 1926,
$5.

The author shall speak for himself: â€œThe purpose
of the narrative is to follow an average American thru
this quarter-century of his countryâ€™s history, to re-
create the flow of the days as he saw them, to picture
events in terms of their influence on him, his daily
life and ultimate destiny. The aim is to appraise the .
actors of history and their activities according to the
way they affected the average man.â€ Always out or

Dear Mr. Kemp:

A few more days and the Ides of March will be
upon us and even at this date a President or two have
made their march down: Pennsylvania Avenue to say
the ever procrastinating â€œI willâ€™. (That phrase has to
do with another dread event as well, hasnâ€™t it?) You
see I have a sense of drama. |

I regret to think that it has been some time since I
have had the pleasure of reading the ever happy
Alumni Magazineâ€”but I still hold the hope that I
will view the copy and revel in the memories recalled
at each page.

When you last heard from me I was, I believe, a
-habitant of that beautiful paradise as often eulogized
in the columns of Arthur Brisbane, San Francisco.
But alas or alack or what have you, I did roam to this
fair city of angles and angels and did enter ye gay
moving picture business. What a business!â€”lI love
it, and all the other little thingsâ€”I love them, too.

Anyway here I am after a long hard pull, the assist-
ant director for Mr. de Mille. We have just finished
a picture with Vera Reynolds, Bob Ober, Phyllis
Haver, Victor Varcomi, Theodore Kosloff, and Fred
Walton, called â€œThe Little Adventuress.â€ You might
enjoy the production when and if staged at I. Wein-
bergâ€™s Palace of Fine Arts and Expression.

Mr. Cecil de Mille has just finished the greatest pic-
ture ever made in this industryâ€”a story of the Christ,
entitled â€œThe King of Kings.â€ You and everyone
else whose good fortune it will be to witness this
triumph, will see a production of such beauty and
magnitudeâ€”yet of such sweetness and simplicity â€”
that you will leave the theatre, I am certain, a bet-
ter piece of clay than when you entered. â€˜This man de
Mille is a genius and regardless of his idiosyncrasies
you would go through Hell and high water for him.

When you answer this, if you do, tell me something
about the T'roubadours and what they are doing. â€˜To
be a member of that organization is an honor and I
say, sincerely, that the experience obtained there has
been of great benefit to me.

Please remember me most kindly to everyone of my
dear friends on the campus and tell John Graham that
he owes me a letter. |

INTERCOLLEGIATE SONG BOOK READY

For nearly two years the representatives of over
one hundred of the foremost American universities
have been cooperating in an effort to put together in
one volume the official alma mater and principal foot-
ball (or â€œfightâ€) songs of the American universities.
Thornton W. Allen, Â°13, well known as the composer
and publisher of college songs, has just announced
that the new book has gone to press and will be ready

for distribution this month. Over half of the edition
has been subscribed for, and as this edition is limited
the subscription committee is urging all those who de-
sire copies to order them as early as possible. The
orders will be filled as received until the edition is ex-
hausted.

Every effort has been put forth to make this new
volume as attractive as possible, and no expense has
been spared in making it handsome as well as complete
and up-to-date. In addition to the 256 pages of music
printed on dull finished Oxford paper of excellent
quality, there are sixteen pages of text matter and
eight pages of illustrations (photographs of the larg-
est and most important college football stadiums in
America.) All of the paper is of ivory finish and the
half-tone cuts are printed on heavy coated stock. The
books are being bound in attractive olive green cloth
with gold lettering. While the book could very read-
ily sell for five dollars per volume, the special price
of $3.75 has been made on this first edition only.

Many of the songs are printed in this volume for
the first time and also included are the greatest college
song hits of record.

Represented in the first volume are over 100 of the
foremost universities.

While the responsibilities of editor-in-chief and
publisher are borne by Thornton W. Allen, 113 W.
57th Street, New York, he has the cooperation of a
large organization of over one hundred college men,
nearly all officially representing their various institu-
tions.

All orders for the Intercollegiate Song Book should
be placed at once with the college cooperative store or
local dealer, or sent direct to the publisher, Thornton
We. Allen, 113 W. 57th Street, New York City, di
orders are sent direct to the publisher they must be
accompanied by check or money order.

Brick has equal value for the poor manâ€™s cottage or As Always the Gathering Place Of
the rich manâ€™s palace, for the cobblerâ€™s shop or the city

hall, the wayside chapel or the metropolitan temple,
and yet combines that strength and beauty which

meets the requirements of both good taste and a thrifty ALUMNI, STUDENTS AND FRIENDS

purse. Other materials have their merits and make their

appeal, but looking at the building problem on all sides, OF WASHINGTON AND LEE

no other material approaches face brick in the struc-
tural and artistic values it offersâ€”permarience, com-
fort, safety from fire, economy, and beauty. You
owe it to yourself to look into this matter thoroughly.
You should discuss the matter with us before deciding.
It will cost you nothing and you are sure to get most

valuable and practical suggestions. Onexcelled Fountain Service
