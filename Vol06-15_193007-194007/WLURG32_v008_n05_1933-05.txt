The President's Page

N THIS YEAR’S annual report, submitted by the
President to the Board of ‘Trustees, there is

the following statement:

‘Most noteworthy of all general factors in the
University life for the session closing is the en-
deavor to enlist new interest and new support on
the part of our alumni. To the promotion of this
work, the president of the alumni, Mr. Walter
McDonald, has brought great intelligence and tire-
less devotion. The necessary expense involved was
borne by a small group of generous sons of Wash-
ington and Lee. Permanent class secretaries for
nearly all groups have given large and unselfish
service. The results for this first year will neces-
sarily prove small but we have every conviction
that we are launching a movement of great pos-
sibility.”

Behind this somewhat formal statemeut lies a story

of beauty and of hope.

Within the hearts of hundreds of our alumni there
has stirred a new concern for the welfare of the Uni-
versity, a new understanding of its problems, a new

sympathy for its endeavor.

There are in this movement irradiations that
strangely move the souls of those permitted to catch the
gleams, brilliant flashes of heroic gallantry, tender
lights of sacrifice. One alumnus, now a professor in
another institution with a salary cut of more than half,
sends in a substantial contribution to the support of his
Alma Mater.

another institution though not himself an alumnus, of-

Another gentleman, also a professor in

fers a donation in the name of his deceased father.
Many letters come in bearing the minimum gifts but

with an attestation of spirit that is priceless.

[3]

In such a light the mere dollar-and-cents signifi-
cance becomes relatively unimportant. The spiritual

strengthening of the University is beyond computation.

For ultimately Washington and Lee will be as
powerful and as fine as its own alumni will it to be.
Other institutions may count upon other resources, the
individual patron, the sustaining community, the income
from church or state. Washington and Lee is essen-
tially dependent upon its own sons. They have tested
it; they can best appraise it ; they hold its future in their

hands.

Somewhere in this future, and in the not very re-
mote future, waits the consummation of the plan which
this year has brought forth. Without a strain upon any
individual, the alumni will be able to supplement the
slender resources of their institution in such a fashion
as will enable it to be the kind of school they want it
to be. The entire fulfillment of that dream is not with-

in the results of this first year.

But already the entire University has felt impres-
sively the measure of supporting loyalty and generosity
which is this year’s record. It is as if a definite turn-
ing point has been reached. From this moment onward,

the course is upward.

It is impossible for those who are working at the
center of the University’s task to express their grat-
itude. The most satisfactory mode of appreciation,
perhaps, is the renewed assurance of a dominating
purpose here on the campus, a purpose to make this
institution worthy of the spirit made manifest in these

recent months.

THE WASHINGTON AND LEE
ALUMNI CAMPAIGN

STARTED OCTOBER 29, 1932

when the Alumni Board of Trustees met with the University Board of Trustees to discuss Alumni
and University affairs.

DR. GAINES WROTE WALTER McDONALD, PRESIDENT OF THE ALUMNI
ASSOCIATION

a letter on November 15th. It is reprinted on page 13. It has been mailed in the past three months
to every alumnus.

A COMMITTEE OF THE ALUMNI BOARD

made a survey of other colleges and the functioning of their alumni associations and collected data
on what their alumni are doing to relieve the stress of these times. This report dated January 16th
is reprinted on pages 14, 15 and 16, and it likewise has been mailed to every alumnus.

THE SPONSORSHIP COMMITTEE

was formed according to the plan proposed, and by March Ist a guarantee fund was contributed,
authorizing the president of the Association to organize and conduct an alumni-wide campaign by
means of class agents. The list of these sponsors is gratefully printed on page 11 in this number of
the magazine.

THE CLASS-AGENTS

were appointed for all classes from 1880 through 1932 and the older classes from 1869 to 1879
were made into one group. During April and May every alumnus of the University totalling nearly
7000 have been written a letter or two, or sometimes three letters, by their class-agents. Never be-
fore in the history of the University has there been such a comprehensive and intensive effort made
to put every alumnus in touch with the University and with each other.

The list of class-agents is published in this number. Among them are those men whose loyalty
and devotion, whose energy and service to the University cannot be surpassed.

THE LAST FEATURE OF THE CAMPAIGN

Just before the campaign closed the first of June, the class-agents sent cards to all members of their
classes from whom they had not heard. Not contributions alone were asked, but an appeal was
made for a communication of news, for friendly letters. This card asked for a dollar, if possible,
if not, at least for a letter.

Class Agents in the Alumni Campaign

HE LAst issue of the Alumni Magazine car-

ried an announcement of the Alumni Campaign
for a revival of interest in the affairs of the University.
A letter from Dr. Gaines, defining the situation that
made the campaign necessary was published and a re-
port from the Alumni Committee offering a plan and a
means of carrying it out.

After a preliminary fund was raised by the Spon-
sorship Committee, Walter McDonald, 1910, President
of the Alumni Association, immediately put into effect
the committee’s plan for a re-organization of the Alum-
ni by class lines, with an appointed class-agent for each
class from 1880 through 1932. There are forty-eight
class-agents who have been in touch, by personal letters,
with the nearly seven thousand alumni of the institu-
tion. In some of the older classes, where the roster is
small, it was not possible to get individual class-agents
and Col. Walter Forrester of Lexington, acted for al-
most the entire group. The classes from 1869 to 1879
totalling 165 men were taken as a group by Mr. John
M. Glenn of New York City.

These forty-eight men by June Ist will have been
in touch with every alumnus who can be reached. Every-
one has had a letter, a copy of Dr. Gaines’ letter, a copy
of the Committee’s survey and report. Based upon the
experience of other universities and colleges using this
method of organization, it looked, at first, as if it would
be possible to raise a fund of $20,000. ‘This estimate
was based upon the experience of universities whose
alumni are organized to give regularly in small annual
contributions. The committee hoped for a certain
percentage of contributors who would average $5 an
alumnus. The difficulty in realizing this estimate is
now analyzed as being due to loose, remote contacts
among the alumni and is not taken as evidence of in-
difference or unability of the alumni to make their
own association self-supporting. With the gradual im-
provement in organization and contact, there will be an
increase in both the number of contributors and the
total annual amount given. It is not felt that there is
a fault in the organization or method. It was not ex-
pected that the result of the first year’s effort would be
ideal or spectacular. ‘There is satisfaction on the part
of everybody that a beginning has been made, that from
year to year, there will be an improvement 1n closer con-
tact and warmer impulses expressed toward the Uni-
versity and all its affairs. The class-agents cordially
undertook the job in the face of hard times, bank strin-
gencies and the worst economic period in our recent

[5]

history. They are being repaid for their efforts by
the renewal of many pleasant associations. Letters
from friend to friend showing interest and loyalty and
affection for the common cause of the University are
in themselves, apart from contributions, evidence of the
revival that was part, and a large part, of the ideals of
the campaign.

tions to their class fund to date are few but widely
scattered.

1930—SNorvteEr Morison of Bristol, Virginia, is also a
lawver. He has 290 men in his class. Snorter
will be as efficient and as popular as class-agent
as he was as president of the Student Body in 1932.

1929—LeEwis PowE .t, Jr. of Richmond is with the law
firm of Christian and Barton. The 316 men in the
class of 1929 are responding better than the aver-
age and one contribution equals the second highest
given by any alumnus.

popular leader and has not been forgotten.

-

1923—Bitt McCati_um is manager of the Knoxville
Claim Division of the Maryland Casualty Compan
at Knoxville, Tenn. He has 206 men and is giving

alumni. Finals this year will be the tenth anni
versary for this class and sentiment is being sound
ed for a reunion.

1922—Jor SILVERSTEIN of Charleston, W. Va., has 213
men. He is a lawyer which relieves him of dis
tinction from a profession! point-of-view, in the

1916—Revs Lewis, in spite of a broken leg that kept
him from his business at the Continental Illinois
Banking and Trust Co. of Chicago, has been in
communication with the 141 members of the class
of 1916. Reub was honored by the University in
the spring of ’'29 with a Phi Beta Kappa key.

1915—K1i WILtiAMs is production manager of the Du-
pont Rayon Company at Waynesboro, Va. He is
having response from his class and maintaining
the average of contribution. Ki came over to Lex-
ington specially to talk over campaign matters and
and brought some of his best letters as proof of
getting what he is after.

1914—CLARENCE SAGER is a lawyer in New York. He
visited Lexington early in May and reported con-
tributions above the average. Clarence is in the
legal department of the Standard Oi! Co. of New
York.

1913—BeEn Fiery of Cleveland, in the firm of Baker,
Hostetler, Sidlo and Patterson, headed by the il-
lustrious Newton D. Baker, an alumnus of Wash-
ington and Lee of 1894, has had contributions
equaling the average.

1912—WriuiaM A. Hyman ranks among the few high
class-agents in both number of contributors and
the amount of their contributions. He has been
busy at the campaign longer than most of the class-
agents and the work he has done in a warm, per-
sonal way, shows. He is a lawyer in New York.

1911—Dana Hopcpon is in the Department of State,
Washington, D. C. He is chief of the Visa Divi-
sion and has one of the largest of the classes of
that time—176 men.

1910 —Wacter McDonatp to his class-mates and
intimates ‘‘Flossie,’’ President of the Alumni Asso-
ciation is the Sales-Manager and Vice-President of
the McDonald Printing Co., an old and fine busi-
ness in Cincinnati. Whenever you use anything
that Proctor and Gamble makes, you are helping
Walter’s business for he prints everything they use
for wrapping and packaging. Nobody but Mc-
Donald has ever printed an Ivory Soap or a Camay
wrapper and the billions of them printed couldn't
be counted. Walter’s class campaign was the first
started and he fired a barrage of letters, cards,
memoranda, bulletins that may have frightened his
friends.

1909—Dr. Jonn WiLiiAM Ctaupy, “Bill” to his
friends and classmates, “Doc” to the thousand in-
mates at the Rockview Prison Farm at Bellefonte,
Pa. The class of 1909 with 140 men leads all
others in the number of contributors and the
amount of contributions.

[7]

Bill Claudy is superintendent of a unique prison
in which there are 1000 men without a wall. He
has seven thousand acres of land with a completely
self-supporting community in diversified occupa-
tions. His experiment is being watched all over
the world. His policy and methods are daring,
and may be influential in reforming penology. Dr.
Claudy was a Presbyterian minister with a fashion-
able congregation in Pittsburgh. Penology and
criminology, from their social aspect, were his
avocations for years and he finally gave up his
ministry to go into a higher one.

The success of his class-campaign has been due
to the warmth and breadth of his friendships and
the strong personal impulse he puts into his letters.

1908—Dozirr DEVANE, a lawyer in Washington, D. C.,

had as high a response from his first letters as any
class-agent heard from yet. His secret, as others
have discovered, is the writing of personal letters.
Dozier is a very active member of the Alumni
Board of Trustees.

1907—Bixt Forp is teacher of mathematics at Wood-
berry Forest school, Woodberry Forest, Va. His
contributions so far, have doubled the average
given.

1906—Pret HoLtanp, a lawyer of Suffolk, Va., got

ately overcame the handicap by an energy that is
always characteristic of him and has not depreci-
ated with the passage of years.

Ect MiLien lives in Germantown ( Philadel-
phia) to which place he was in the midst of mov-

1905 came to him and he immediately and cordially
went to work.

1904— WALLER C. Harpy of Charleston, W. Va., has
70 classmates to whom he presented the campaign
and the opportunity to share in it. His own con-
tribution as class-agent was matched only by the
Hon. John W. Davis, class-agent for 1892.

1903—Dr. Samuet McP. Grascow is the pastor of the
Independent Presbyterian Church ot Savannah,
Georgia, founded in 1755, not long after the found-
ing of our own institution. There are 64 men who
will have letters from him.

1902—Morrison Hurcueson, physician, diagnostician,
hospital and medical college staff man of Rich-

chairman of the History Committee of the Mary-

m6 A 4D Ak ME

land Tercentenary Commission in charge of the
Charter Celebration in 1932. His responses were
among the earliest and contributions sent him
among the most generous. In The Ring-tum Phi
there was a recent article on old-time baseball in
the 90’s by Mr. Andrews who was captain of the
team. It is not betraying confidence to publish
that many of his letters were on this theme and
they brought quick responses.

1900—Lynwoop Hotes of Philadelphia, is with Fur-
ness, Withy and Company, Ltd., shipowners and
agents. They are agents for sixteen steamship
lines whose lines cover the earth. ‘Their offices
are likewise globe-wide. Contributions in this
class rank high in individual amounts.

1899—Harry St. Georce TucKER CARMICHAEL has
twenty-nine letters in his name and lives in a place
with six—Kyrock, which is in Kentucky and is
owned entirely by the Kentucky Rock Asphalt Co.,
and Harry Carmichael. He is remembered by
many as the engineer of Floyd Collins in the Sand
Cave disaster. Among his contributions is the
second largest individual one received. Harry Car-
michael is known among the alumni as one of the
most loyal and enthusiastic sons -of Washington
and Lee. He is often in Lexington and has a host
of old and new friends here.

1898—RicHarp Flournoy, JR., is in the Department
of State in Washington, in which department he
has a fellow class-agent, Dana Hodgdon, 1911,
and a fellow-townsman, Dozier Devane, 1908.

1897—Prtre Hamitton of New Orleans, is not merely
class-agent but general round-up man for all
Washington and Lee men in his vicinity. He
has the longest list of straight five dollar contribu-
tors of any class-agent and the devotion he has
given to the job is a model not for this campaign—
but for any! His many friends will be glad to
know that he is better after a serious fall in which
he broke his back a year ago.

1896—Mayor Heru Ty er, former mayor of Norfolk,
Va., had a special roster of the 67 men in his class
sent to every member. He has a son, Jimmie, in
the law school, graduating this year.

1895—Dr. Tuomas Farrar of the Faculty has charge
of the 52 men in this class and is enthusiastic in
rounding them up.

1894—Mr. JAMES VEECH lives near Louisville. His
most prominent classmate is the Hon. Newton D.

The Lee Statue Anniversary

RIEF but impressive services in Lee Chapel on
Sunday afternoon, May 7th, under the auspices
of the Alumni Association, marked the fiftieth
anniversary of the dedication of Edward Valentine's
famous Recumbent Statue of General Robert E. Lee.
Dr. Francis P. Gaines, president of the University, and
the Hon. Stuart Moore who received his A.B. here
in 1915 and his LL.B. in 1921, delivered a short address
on behalf of
the alumni.
A feature
of the cere-
monies was
the placing
of the re-
stored Con-
tederate flag
as a
oall for Gen-
Lee's
coffin a

the foot of

Montgomery
who gradu-
ated under

General Lee
in 1869.'This
flag, on public view for the first time in sixty-three
years, was restored for the occasion by the Lexington
Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.
Mr. Montgomery, whose home is near Collierstown,
Virginia, is the oldest alumnus of the University living
in the vicinity of Lexington. He was assisted in the
ceremony by Carl B. Vickers, vice-president of the
Student Body and a guard of honor from the Virginia
Military Institute.

Dr. Gaines opened the services by giving a brief
history of the movement to erect a fitting memorial to
General Lee, culminating in the great work by Valen-
tine. He explained the occasion was not the fiftieth
anniversary of the formal dedication of the statue,
which took place later than the ceremony commemo-
rated last Sunday, but rather it marked the “dedication
of the University to the statue” and to the great ideals
exemplified by the man who is represented by it.

Mr. Moore spoke of the occasion as one of those
which aids in the closer union of the alumni of the in-

 

The Edward Valentine Recumbent Statue of Lee

[9 ]

stitution through the celebration of common traditions.
He then introduced Mr. Montgomery as the oldest ex-
ponent of the teachings of General Lee living in the
vicinity.

favorite hymns of General Lee, “How Firm a Founda-
At the close of the ceremonies the audience

Dr. William

Besides
Vickers, the
Student

Body was
repre-
sented on

the platform
by Henry C. Robert, president of the senior law class ;
Fred Cooke, president of the senior science class; and
Ed Bacon, president of the senior commerce class.

The services were well attended by students, faculty
members, alumni, members of the surrounding commun-
itv, and many distinguished guests. Honor guests who
sat in Lee’s pew were Miss Annie White, former Uni-
versity librarian; Mrs. Stevens, and Mrs. Showell,
daughters of Governor John Letcher, wartime governor
awarded General Lee a commission in
army; General Lee was godfather to
Captain Greenlee Letcher, son of the
governor, also attended.

of Colonel William A. Anderson, member of the Board

ation, whose headquarters in the conduct of the cam-
paign have been at the Alumni Office since the middle
of April sent to all class-agents a bulletin after the
lee Anniversary celebration. His interpretation of it
adds a little to the above account.

“Yesterday afternoon in Lee Chapel, May 7th,
at five-thirty, was held a simple commemorative service
in honor of the 50th anniversary of the acquisition by
the University of the Valentine Statue of Lee, the
Mausoleum and the deed of trust that invested in the
University in perpetuity the rights in all that has be-
come the sacred shrine of Lee.

“The service was held under the auspices of the
alumni of the University. Stuart Moore, treasurer
of the Association, spoke on behalf of more than seven
thousand living sons of the University and heirs to the
heritage of Lee in re-dedicating ourselves to Lee’s mem-
ory, in declaring the benefits of his undying influence
and the riches he left us. In a time when the substance
of other values is being shattered, there was a solemn
reverential pause here yesterday, to reconsider the
things of the spirit in which the University is founded.
Dr. Gaines, in defining the occasion, said that the statue
of Lee, the shrine of Lee’s ashes, can be honored only
by taking upon ourselves the obligation to re-dedicate
what we are and what we have to that memory and in-
fluence that have become timeless and change only in
their increasing effect upon us.

“As a symbol of the charge Stuart Moore put upon
the Alumni, there was put upon view for the first time
in 63 years, the Confederate Battle Flag used as a pall
on General Lee’s coffin. This very fragile, torn em-
blem was set upon a standard at the foot of the statue
by Mr. John Robert Montgomery, the oldest alumnus
in this vicinity who graduated at Washington College
under General Lee. Mr. Montgomery belongs to the
class of 1869. His picture with the flag, Dr. Gaines,
Mr. Moore, the president of the student bedy, the four
presidents of the senior class, and a guard of honor
from V. M. I., was taken and will be sent as an item
of national historic news to the papers ot the country.
The chapel was filled with representative people of the
community, the university, students, and cadets.

‘“T should like to convey to you some feeling of the
significance of this occasion. Nowhere else but in Lex-
ington can such things happen—celebrations, deep in
meaning and in feeling and in influence, whose external
features are so simple that they seem spontaneously to
happen.”

a

Meeting with Senior Classes

AT A MEETING of the Seniors on May 4th for the
election of a valedictorian, Cy Young appeared before
the body of our next and newest alumni and explained
the campaign and the re-organization plan. He gave
to the seniors a cordial invitation into the fellowship of
the alumni which represents the Greater University.
He told them of the help they could get, in starting
business and professional careers, by considering Wash-
ington and Lee alumni as a great fraternity so widely
scattered, so deeply penetrating into the business, pro-
fessional and social order of the entire nation, that
wherever they might go, they would find a possible as-
sociation with other men who have the same collegiate
background and feeling and loyalties.

He then explained more in detail the organization
by classes and said that the class of 1933, upon leaving
the University, will have an appointed class-agent, who,
next year and the years to come, will keep their class
organization together and keep all in touch with each
other and the University.

This meeting brought one phase of the new organi-
zation to a logical and successful conclusion by adding
three hundred men or so, to the seven thousand now
in the ranks of Washington and Lee alumni.

Sponsorship Committee Fund Donors

Ast November five Trustees of the University
and one alumnus started a fund by giving one
hundred dollars each that has been called the
Sponsorship Fund of the Alumni Campaign. It was
the beginning of the revival that has culminated in gifts
from many alumni from every part of the country
through the organized plan of class-agents. It was the
sponsor's privilege to underwrite the expenses of the
general Campaign so that individual gifts from alumni
to their class funds could go undiminished into the
treasury of the Alumni Association. These men are:
George Walker St. Clair of Tazewell, Va., Rector
of the University.
Charles J. McDermott of New York.
William McChesney Martin of St. Louis.

Jimmy Watts Captures Golf Title

Jimmy Watts, Washington and Lee’s sterling
freshman golfer, garnered additional laurels when he
won the Old Dominion State golf championship Fri-
day, May 19. His opponent in the final round was Fay
Ingalls of Hot Springs, where the tournament was
held. The match was decided on the 28th hole where
Watts was out with 10 up and 8 to go.

By his victory Watts won the first leg on the Old
Dominion Challenge Trophy. Billy Howell, former
Washington and Lee golf captain, last year’s winner,
who did not compete this year, holds two legs on the
trophy. Watts was a finalist last year, losing to Howell
in the final, round.

Another Washington and Lee student, N. L. Aus-
tin, showed up well in this tournament. Austin lost to
Ingalls in the semi-final round when he was clearly off
his game and was down six holes at the turn, and lost

7 and 6 to Ingalls.

Mattingly,’25, Registrar Since 1920

THE UNUSUAL occurrence of a man acting in the
capacity of a prominent university official and under-
graduate at the same time, appears in the story of the
early days at Washington
and Lee of Earl S. Mat-
tingly, °25, registrar of the
University since 1920. Re-
vealed in this same story is
the tale of a successful strug-
gle against odds to obtain a
college education. Mr. Mat-
tingly’s period of service to
Washington and Lee dates
from 1916. In September of
that year he came to Wash-
ington and Lee as a freshman, following an uphill grind
to educate himself in night school after leaving gram-
mar school.

 

The next year he became student assistant to the
treasurer, but his quest for a degree was temporarily
halted in 1917 when, the United States then being in the
World War, he served for a short time in the infantry,
the medical corps, and later in the field artillery officers’
training school. His battery was among the first to be
discharged following the signing of the Armistice,
which enabled him to return to his old job at Wash-
ington and Lee in January, 1919. He continued to at-
tend the few classes which time from the treasurer's
office permitted.

He became registrar of the University in Septem-
ber, 1920. During the college year which started at the
time he did not attempt to attend classes, preferring to
acquaint himself with the duties of his new position. In
addition to the duties of this position, he also served
the United States government as a “dollar-a-year man,”
handling the correspondence and records relative to the
rehabilitation of World War veterans at Washington
and Lee. During his time as the treasurer’s assistant
and registrar from the close of the war until 1925 he
managed to find time to attend some classes in pursuit
of the long-sought A.B. degree, which he received in
1925.

For several years following the war, Mr. Mattingly
added to his already well-filled program of work the
management of the University Dining hall which was
well patronized at.that time as none of the fraternities
on the campus possessed houses.

Mr. Mattingly belongs to Phi Delta Theta fratern-
ity and is a member of the Survey Commission of the
General Council of that fraternity. He was instru-
mental in the building of the new Phi Delta Theta house

I

m AG tA 22 oN ae

at Washington and Lee three years ago. He was the
first president of the Troubadours, Washington and
Lee's student dramatic organization, president of the
now-defunct student Y. M. C. A., and a member of the
executive committee of the student body.

Dr. Campbell’s Lucky Piece

WueEN Walter McDonald came back to Lexington
to open his campaign headquarters, one of his first
calls was upon Dr. Harry. He looked at Walter quiz-_
zically and pulled a funny petrified animal out of his
pocket and said:

“Walter, here is another resident of Cincinnati.”
Walter was happy he hadn't said fossil. Then Dr.
Harry said he calls him “Chalymenia’” and sometimes —
“Cal” for short. But whatever Washington and Lee’s —
eminent geologist may call him, “Cal’’ is blissfully igno-
rant of the fact that he has a name. He has two ears,
all right, but for all practical purposes, they are as
worthless as the lusterless eyes which protrude from the
forepart of his head. “Cal” is as dead and lifeless as
any stone that can be found in the world, for “Cal”
is stone. The tiny spark of life which, two hunderd
million years ago, in the Paleozoic era, caused him to
crawl about upon a prehistoric sea shore, no longer
exists in his small, petrified form. The terror that
must have gleamed in his eyes, upon being buried alive
by an inadvertent upheaval of the elements, has faded.
“Cal” is dead to the world, but not to Dr. Campbell.

Several years ago the Doctor while on one of his
numerous trips, rescued ‘“Chalymenia” from his an-_
cient resting place ‘‘out in Ohio, by the Cincinnati Arch,
where there are pretty girls and beds of limestone,”
and now carries him about in his vest pocket as a sort
of good luck piece. “Cal” and the Doctor are never
parted, for this tiny ridged ball of stone, this trilobite,
is the symbol of the unknown. The age in which he
lived passed long before the coming of man and what
existed in it can only be surmised upon by reading the
scanty, incomplete story of the rocks. The life which
“Cal” observed about him has disappeared into mystery.
His two dull eyes, no longer mirroring what he saw,
are challenges to the modern geologist of today. Dr.
Campbell accepted it and has adopted the challenger as
a continuous companion and now in 1933 finds that he
has become attached to ‘“Chalymenia.”” Only several
days ago he said, “I think more of ‘Cal’ than of some
people.” He gave Walter another of his twinkling
smiles.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY
LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

November 15, 1932.

Mr. Walter A. McDonald, President
Washington and Lee Alumni
Cincinnati, Ohio.

My dear Mr. McDonald:

I am sure the alumni will be interested to learn the general effects of the economic depression upon the
work of their Alma Mater. In frank confidence, I venture to lay the facts before you.

Our income is derived principally from two sources, student fees and income from endowment. In an
effort to keep up the standard which is indispensable to the character of Washington and Lee, we have suf-
fered, along with other institutions, a loss in enrollment, our present registration being about 90 below that
of the peak years. The yield from capital funds, as was inevitable, has shown a sharp decline.

We have put into effect every possible economy. Certain expenditures, like improvement of grounds
and buildings as distinct from upkeep, have been entirely discontinued; others, like travel and publicity, have
been reduced, though they were already deplorably low. Every possible saving, short of invading the essential
program of the University, has been made. Our budget, which was small at best, has been lowered by about

fifteen per cent.

In spite of these steps we face a deficit for the current year.

Recognizing that this is not a time for a general appeal, we have hoped, nevertheless, that a plan might be
devised by the alumni which would entail no burden upon any individual at any given time but would repre-
sent a systematic and sustained assistance. This might prove the margin between good work, on the most
economical basis, and a struggle below the plane of efficiency. Washington and Lee has seven thousand alumni ;
a small assistance from each, or from a large number of them, would bring in a total that would be now of in-

calculable aid.

For several years the University has borne the expense of the alumni office, a valuable factor in ar-
ticulating the University with its former students. You can appreciate the fact that in the days of stringency,
we have been compelled to limit sharply even that small program; but we trust that the alumni themselves will

not permit it to be damaged.
May I add that if there ever was a time when Washington and Lee needed the active support of its sons,
this is the time.

Cordially yours,

Pinas sake le. Nez, Mie ioe

Report of Alumni Fund Committee

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY ALUMNI, INC.:

OUR committee, appointed to consider and carry into effect a plan for the
reorganization of this association, submits its report and recommendations,
after having made a serious study of conditions surrounding our own uni-
versity and alumni activities as well as the successful methods in force by
alumni organizations during the past few years at institutions similar in size
and rank to Washington and Lee.

This committee adopts as its premise the principle that Washington
and Lee Alumni owe to themselves and to their university the duty to con-
vert the present loosely formed association into a forceful organization,
embracing the widespread interest of its seven thousand living alumni and
constituting itself as a strong, active factor in the present and future wel-
fare of Washington and Lee. The successful experience of other alumni
bodies convinces us that our alumni can accomplish, in proportion, what
others have done and are doing. For this association to maintain its self-
respect it must first attain a condition of self-support and must further justify its right to exist by offering
some positive benefit to the university of which it is a part, rather than in continuing as a burden, however ac-
ceptable, upon the finances of the university.

 

Within the past five years, similar institutions have definitely abandoned high-powered, intensive cam-
paigns for large financial contributions from a small number of alumni, substituting instead methods designed
to secure the interest and support of a large number of members who are called upon for only such financial
assistance as will not prove onerous. We have provided for this in our present system of voluntary dues of
$5.00 or multiples thereof, and it is recommended that this be rendered sufficiently elastic to permit contribu-
tions of any amount, however small, as evidence of interest on the part of the contributor. Although lacking
established class organizations, we concur in the experience of other schools that the interest of the alumni
can best be aroused and maintained through one or more agents appointed for each class, who can, through
their activity, render a service more valuable than any financial contribution. We, therefore, propose this
method of operation in lieu of any plan of local or geographic effort.

The fund to be derived from this plan is to be employed primarily for the support and maintenance
of an active alumni organization, relieving the university of its present expense in that connection, and the re-
mainder of the fund is to be expended by the alumni for such projects as it may deem best suited to the needs
of the university. It is not proposed to constitute a capital fund, but to rely upon a substantial number of rela-
tively small contributions, preferably on an annual basis, carrying with them a renewed concern for the gen-
eral welfare of the university and the establishment of closer contacts between the university and the individ-
ual alumnus. In brief, what is desired is no short-lived outburst of alumni enthusiasm, but a continuing rec-
ognition of the obligation of loyalty facing every alumnus, unhampered by burdensome financial demands
upon him, but affording the opportunity to maintain, without undue sacrifice, the ties which should bind him
ever closer to his university.

It is desirable that this be accomplished without undue delay, and again, the experience of other alumni
bodies demonstrates that this plan is entirely successful even though conducted in these present lean years. To
place this opportunity before our large body of widely scattered alumni will require not less than $2500 during
the present year. We suggest an immediate appeal for contributions of $25 each from one hundred interested
alumni, in order to inaugurate and make effective this plan, and, with the response we may expect from this
appeal, we have every confidence that our alumni will be awakened and united in this concerted effort to
properly discharge our responsibilities to Washington and Lee.

Rare Books at Washington and Lee

By BLANCHE PricHARD McCrum

F ALL THE rare qualities that books may have,

the rarest is some association, some sign, that

shows the copy in question to be the only one of
its kind in the world. When such a sign is the authen-
tic signature of a great man, the volume in question be-
comes twice precious : once, because it is unique ; twice,
because it was handled, read, and treasured by a human
being, now numbered with the immortals, but once a
booklover like us all. ‘Two books of this kind at Wash-
ington and Lee possess peculiar power to stir the imagi-
nation, in just this way.

The first is a small leather bound volume entitled
The Beauties of Johnson, consisting of maxims, obser-
vations, etc., etc. The fifth edition, part Il. London,
printed for G. Kearsly, in Fleet Street, 1782. We are
further informed on the title page that the book was to
be had, sewed, for two shillings, six pence. Time has
had its way with this little volume, for although it is
still firm and staunch in its covers, the leather binding
is scuffed, a few pages are dog-eared, once a leaking
pen blotted a reference, and again weather, or the pro-
verbial moth and rust, has injured an occasional leaf.
But still clear and definite on the upper right hand
corner of the title page appears the characteristic
signature of the owner, “G. Washington.” As one
handles the book, it falls open at the following selection
on page 133, where the page is turned down:

PROVIDENCE

“If the extent of the human view could com-
prehend the whole frame of the universe, perhaps
it would be found invariably true, that Providence
has given that in greatest plenty, which the condi-
tion of life makes of greatest use; and that nothing
is penuriously imparted, or placed far from the
reach of man, of which a more liberal distribution,
or more easy acquisition, would increase real or
rational felicity.”

One likes to think that this book may have been waiting
for the Father of His Country at Mount Vernon, on
Christmas Eve in 1783, when he came home, and as
Woodrow Wilson said, “put the Revolution behind him
as he would have laid aside a book that was read.” It
was at this period of his life that he wrote to Lafayette,
‘‘T am become a private citizen on the banks of the Po-
tomac; and under the shadow of my own vine and my
own fig-tree ... I have not only retired from all public
enjoyments, but I am retiring within myself ... En-

vious of none, I am determined to be pleased with all;
and this, my dear friend, being the order of my march,
I will move gently down the stream of time until I sleep
with my fathers.” His halcyon period was short, we
know, and soon great affairs claimed him again. but
in the meantime, it is good to think, as these wellworn
pages indicate, that he studied Dr. Johnson, and that
their upright spirits met across time and space.

Washington in his will left to his nephew, Bushrod
Washington, his library, which was, however, to re-
main in the possession of Mrs. Washington until such
a time as she was ready to turn it over to the general’s
nephew. This volume from her husband’s library she
may have treasured particularly, for it seems probable
that it passed with other things belonging to her to her
grandson, George Washington Parke Custis, the father
of Mrs. Robert E. Lee. At any rate, eventually it be-
came the property of General G. W. C. Lee, whose in-
scription in the book reads, “Presented to Washington
and Lee University by G. W. C. Lee, Feby. 1894.”

The second association volume which ranks as a par-
ticular treasure carries on its title page the signature
of General Robert E. Lee, and also that of General G.
W. C. Lee. Its title reads: Aide-memoire portatif a
l'usage des officiers du genie... par J. Laisne. Brux-
elles, Meline, Cans et compagnie, 1839, and its history
runs thus.

When General Lee, then a captain of Engineers,
went off to the Mexican War, one of his most important
duties was taking charge of the siege of the castle of
San Juan de Ulloa, at Vera Cruz. The city fell after
seven days and Captain Lee received favorable mention
from General Scott in official dispatches. In establish-
ing batteries and planning the siege, Captain Lee used
the only technical book he had taken with him to Mexi-
co, a military engineer’s handbook, or the aide-memoire
now being described. It is a volume of 601 pages,
bound in tooled leather and marbled boards, with “R. E.
Lee” stamped in gold on the back. As a startling com-
mentary on the evanescence of human life, one finds
scattered through the book, and still in perfect preserva-
tion, the leaves of various Mexican plants, placed there
as markers by General Lee, who was at the time just
in his prime. Years after the Mexican War, the book
was given to G. W. C. Lee by his father, was used by
the son in the Civil War and again at V. M. I. when he
was a professor, and was annotated by his hand. The
present excellent condition of the book, as well as the

technical french in which it is written, bears witness
to the fastidious habits and sound scholarship of its
distinguished owners.

Turning from association copies to subject matter
for interest, the reader expects that Virginia history
is a field in which an old Virginia college would spec-
ialize. And it is true that most of the great names in
early Virginiana are represented in the library. The
first in point of time is John Smith’s Generall historie,
the re-issue of 1627, containing the much-prized maps
of Virginia, New England, and the “Summer IIs’. This
hook is the brightest jewel of the whole collection,
since it adds to rarity and fame a most interesting as-
sociation, again with the Lee family. Following the
Smith, chronologically, comes George Sandys’ transla-
tion of Ovid's Metamorphosis, Oxford, 1632, “the first
‘expression of elaborate poetry, the first utterance of the
conscious literary spirit articulated in America’.” Next
in order is Robert Beverley’s history of 1705, called the
first genuine historical study of Virginia after that of
John Smith. Keith, 1738, Stith, of 1747, and Burk,
of 1804-1816, in four volumes, round out the count of
the most important sources of information concerning
the Old Dominion in its infancy. Some of these titles
were gifts, some purchases, one was got by exchange
of duplicates. Little by little, over a period of years,
and without any great outlay, they have been assembled
as the indispensable volumes for the serious student.

In the past, Washington and Lee has been particu-
larly fortunate in having acquired en bloc several fine
old libraries. Such is the classical library of 3600
volumes collected by Mr. N. P. Howard of Richmond,
and. at his death purchased and given to the university
in 1872 by a notable benefactor, Mr. W. W. Corcoran
of Washington. The original manuscript catalogue
of the library is still preserved and all of its items are
of great interest. But in point of antiquity, at least
three of the Howard volumes stand out because they
date back to the years just following the invention of
printing, in the fifteenth century. The earliest of these
incunabula was published about 1475, by the press of
Herman Lichtenstein of Vicenza. It is the work of a
young Spanish monk, Paulus Orosius, a disciple of
Saint Augustine in 415 A. D. Under the inspiration
of his spiritual father, and as a sort of after-word to
Augustine’s City of God, Orosius wrote the first Chris-
tian universal history. He called it Historiarum adver-
sus paganos libri septem, or, Seven books against the
pagans. In it he committed the unpardonable sin in a
historian: he took a thesis and wrested fact to prove it.
The pagans are left without a leg to stand upon, and the
Christians emerge as the only important element in his-
tory. However, Orosius’ age liked its history done with

purple patches, and the book early became a classic,
which enjoyed wide currency in manuscript before the
invention of printing. The library copy is a sumptuous
volume, bound in red leather upon which is stamped
in gold the arms of a former owner, John, second Earl
Spencer. One surprising feature of the book is the
Roman type in which it is printed. In 1475, most of
the type was still Gothic; that is, the type of the Guten-
berg Bible. But Lichtenstein seems to have been an
early innovator in the use of the much simpler Roman
type, and so he became an influence in the movement
that is responsible for the fact that we, today, read our
books in clear, simple print, rather than in the crabbed
script that for so long afflicted the student of German.

Coming down to more modern times, the greatest
bibliophile interest at Washington and Lee is connected
with that section of the library that was originaliy col-
lected by that splendid old debating club, the Franklin
Society. This organization, which for nearly a hun-
dred years cherished the things of the mind and dis-
cussed matters of current moment, assembled a really
excellent library. At the times when Washington Irv-
ing and Herman Melville were best sellers, the Frank-
lin Society was buying current books, circulating them,
wearing them out, and replacing them. The legacy of
such a library is always a fascinating one, since it is
compounded of many problems as to editions, “issues,”
“states,” “points”, and all the other minutiz that the
modern book-collecting game has developed. During
part of the same time that the Franklin Society was
collecting books, the two college debating societies, the
Washington and the Graham, were also assembling li-
braries along similar lines. All of these book collec-
tions eventually were concentrated in the general Uni-
versity library, where they give a decided antiquarian
flavor. Certain editions among them are unquestion-
ably “firsts”. The two shabby little volumes of the
1832 Alhambra, published without Washington Irving’s
name, are clearly a first edition. One of these volumes
was owned by Seldon M. Burton, in 1833, and by him
presented to the Graham Society in 1840. The other
volume was given to the Washington Society by J. K.
Caskie in 1833. Irving’s Tales of a Traveller, written
under the pseudonym of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., was
originally number 520 in the Franklin Society library.
This is also a genuine first, but because it lacks the
brown paper covers in which the four parts once ap-
peared, a collector would consider it without its best
“point.” However, by great good luck, there is still
another “point” that must be reckoned with for this
book, and it the Washington and Lee copy has. On
page 99, line 13, of part 2, ‘‘a thousand” is printed “at

housand”’. In the second issue of the first edition, this

[ 19 ]

ish & A: Bip UA Bee

mistake was corrected. ‘Therefore the presence of the
mistake proves priority of printing. Another Irving
puzzle has to do with the map in his Astoria. Evident-
ly the original cloth binding was not sufficiently elegant
to please the first owner of this copy, for it is rebound
in contemporary sheep. Now the map that is supposed
to be in volume 2, for which collectors always look, is
missing. But volume 1, which is not supposed to have
a map, does have one. Did the binder slip when he
did his work? Or was this set one of those originally
bound in blue cloth? If so, there is a chance that the
map was always in volume 1, instead of in volume 2,
where the binders of the red or brown cloth bound
copies put it.

One of the most illusive facts connected with any
book studied up to this time has to do with whether
or not Herman Melville’s Mardi has the right end
papers for an early copy. It seems that fancy end
papers, that is, orange ones, were used for the earliest
copies of first editions of Melville. Later, when the
supply of colored ones gave out, plain end papers were
used for the remainder of the edition. Collectors,
therefore, discriminate against the copies with plain
end papers as being later than those with fancy ones.
The Washington and Lee copy has end papers that are
neither orange nor white, but a sort of faded lemon.
In the face of this discrepancy, the hope is cherished
that lemon is far enough removed from white to be
called fancy. ;

Such are some of the intimate details that make
a study of unusual books one of the most fascinating
of all hobbies. Many other volumes owned by the Uni-
versity deserve honorable mention, and some present
even more intriguing problems. These are worth see-
ing. It is the cordial wish of the library staff that visit-
ing alumni will examine the book collection for them-
selves when they return to the campus. Doubtless
Washington and Lee numbers among her sons many
bookmen, whose suggestions and criticisms would prove
most helpful, and whose interest would be an added in-
spiration to those who are charged with the responsibil-
ity for studying and describing one of the real treasures
of the University—its books.

Washington Papers Found

A LARGE box containing priceless papers was found —
in Lee chapel recently by Miss Helen Webster, secretary
to ‘Treasurer Paul M. Penick. The box which was
left unopened since the death of Miss Mary Lee, daugh-
ter of General Lee, contained the last of the undiscoy-
ered accounts of General George Washington, in whose ~
hand all the manuscript is written. 7

This is said by authorities to be the most valuable —
of the papers, and President Gaines said that he —
would write the Congressional library, in whose posses- —
sion the other part of the Washington papers are, in
reference to them. It is thought that the University —
will add them to its private collection of historical j
manuscripts.

Among the other papers is a note written by
Thomas Jefferson to Edmund Randolph, asking for the
loan of five or six spades or shovels, because he had
twenty-one men waiting to go to work on the canal
and only fifteen or sixteen shovels.

There are also numerous letters from various mem- —
bers of Washington’s immediate family, but there is —
no particular significance attached to these. A letter —
from Sam Houston to a friend thanking him for aid —
during Texas’ fight for freedom is among the papers.

Most interesting of all these papers is a letter from
Thomas Alexander in regard to the ownership of a
negro slave. Alexander sold a plot of land situated on
the Potomac River to John Parke Custis. This land
was later owned by the Lee family and is now the
estate of Arlington, national shrine and memorial to
one of America’s most famous families.

The Sigma Delta Chi Gridiron Dinner

By Harry K. YouNG

LrHOoUGH Finals Week did not begin until the

evening after the end of examinations, com-

mencement festivities received a most auspicious
beginning on the evening of May 27, when the Wash-
ington and Lee chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, profes-
sional journalistic fraternity, entertained a hundred and
fifty guests at a Gridiron Dinner which was the out-
standing student presentation of many, many years.

Patterned after the celebrated Washington Grid-
iron Dinners, the Washington and Lee affair kept fac-
ulty, students, visiting newspaper men, and other guests
of the chapter in a happy frame of mind for more than
three hours, and it was with regret that the banqueteers
saw the curtain rung down for the occasion.

The Gridiron Dinner was more than just a dinner.
It was a full program of vaudeville skits and surprise
situations arranged by faculty and students of the jour-
nalism department with the able assistance of half a
dozen others. Franklin M. Reck, assistant managing
editor of the American Boy magazine, Detroit, was
master of ceremonies, with J. Franklin Jones, a journal-
ism senior as his assistant. The speaker of the even-
ing, whose address came at the close of the program,
was J. Frederick Essary, chief of the Washington
bureau of the Baltimore Sun. _

The dinner was an invitation affair, was formal,
and came at the end of a five weeks publicity campaign
that left many in doubt as just what to expect. Skits
on the program panned and kidded Lexington and
Washington and Lee characters and situations, but
when the evening was over not a soul found his feelings
hurt, and everybody commended the efforts of the
members of Sigma Delta Chi who had spent so many
hours in preparation of the program.

Festivities began with a Stranger’s Interlude skit
in which the toastmaster and a dozen others, including
several members of the faculty, spoke their thoughts in
a monotone. Mr. Reck put everyone in a merry mood
by reading his expense account, which included almost
everything from a new pair of trousers to surround the
patch in his best trousers to a new car to take the place
of the one he wrecked in the mountains of Virginia.

Depicted as an Institution for the Slightly Insane,
Washington and Lee was taken off in a skit in which
half a dozen faculty membérs were imperscnated. Next
came a track meet scene participated in by four Uni-
versity of Virginia runners and one Washington and

Lee man, who in the end vanquished his opponents, who
had been shot accidentally by the starter.

The Three Philosophy Boys impersonated Drs.
Hancock, Helderman, and Shannon, who were “burden-
ed down with Ph.D.’s, but nevertheless strove hard to
please,” and the Educational Hour was a broadcast of
a final examination with the announcer pausing to give
the correct De la Warr Benjamin Easter Standing
Time.

A conversation between the statues of George
Washington and Cyrus McCormick brought down the
house when Washington said it wasn’t so much fun
being on top of Washington College because the view
was poor all the time and worse on clear days because
one could see Buena Vista then.

Dean Gilliam, Treasurer Penick, and Professors
Hoyt, Morton, and Flick took a mild ride in a skit
in which Mahatma Ghandi enrolled as a student at
Washington and Lee; and everyone laughed at a take-
off on Omicron Delta Kappa in which Chief of Police
King, the only Dold, Lew the Lecherous Laundryman,
Dixie Nunn, Herb the Dog Man, and One-Armed Zoll-
man were tapped for membership in Oh Do Say, leader-
ship fraternity with a motto meaning “I had a fra-
ternity brother in the chapter last year.”

Two announcements featured the five weeks of
publicity. One was the announcement that a brown
derby would be awarded to some faculty member, and
the other was a series of feature stories written by an
unknown Wallace Waddlestone, who took editorial
liberties galore in his advance stories. Guests at the
banquet were delighted when Mr. Waddlestone in the
flesh crashed the dining hall shortly after the opening
of the program. John D. Morse, a visitor from De-
troit and a member of the Illinois chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi several years ago, impersonated Waddlestone.
He insisted on interrupting the program half a dozen
times in an effort to deliver an oral disquisition on the
culture of the Hawaiian pineapple, and finally nearly
broke up the meeting when he was carried on the arms
of two students and thrown out the door to the accom-
paniment of breaking glass.

The brown Derby was awarded by John Culley,
president of Sigma Delta Chi, to Dr. Henry Donald
Campbell, and the beloved geologist was given an ova-
tion that lasted for several minutes.

Mr. Essary’s talk, completely off the record, dealt

[ 21 ]

|. <3 Ach: th: EN

intimately with the Washington situation. It was well-
given and well-received.

Plans were so well made that the banquet went off
without a hitch. Following the dinner, Sigma Delta
Chi held formal initiation for eight undergraduates of
the department of journalism and seven visiting news-
paper men. ‘These newspaper men were introduced at
the dinner and were presented with large wooden medals
commemorative of the occasion. ‘The men were:

Arthur Robb, managing ‘editor of Editor and Pub-
lisher, New York; William W. Hawkins, vice-chair-
man of the Scripps-Howard newspapers, New York;
Major Powell Glass, 1907, associate publisher of the
Lynchburg News and Advance; Carl D. Ruth, Wash-
ington correspondent for the Block newspapers; Frank
Fuller, Richmond bureau manager -of the Associated
Press; Lowell Mellet, editor of the Washington Daily
News; and Mr. Essary.

John Sorrells, ‘17, executive editor of the Scripps-
Howard newspapers was to be initiated but was pre-
vented from coming to Lexington by last-minute busi-
ness.

Guest of honor at the banquet was Charlies G.
Ross, Washington correspondent for the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch and president of the Washington Grid-
iron Club. Mr. Ross spoke briefly near the end of the
program.

Full credit is due the Washington and Lee depart-
ment of journalism and the members of Sigma Delta
Chi for the banquet which everyone hopes will become
an annual institution. ~ If such is the case, lucky will
be the man who receives an invitation.

Old Alumnus Tre Crew Races

WELL, I’m coming back to Commencement. No:
I don’t mean “Finals’—I mean Commencement, the
good old kind. The last time I was there, I said “Never
again for me.” Why? Because they didn’t have Com-
mencement. They had dances in the morning, and
dances in the afternoon, and dances at night; they had
receptions and such like, and they did have a baseball
game; but that isn’t Commencement.

Commencement means a boat race as a main fea-
ture. Of course they hand out some diplomas and the
graduates wear caps and gowns, which doesn’t remind
me of anything in my time. We wore our clothes—
or other clothes, if we had any other—but the boat
race was what occupied first place in our minds and
scraped the bottom of our pocketbooks, hiring saddle
horses or buggies to take our girls down to the tow-
path where we could follow the Albert Sydneys and
Harry Lees from the first lock up to the bridge. Of
course the years have changed that and the race takes

 

I

MB AiG A % § 37-S

place on the river stretch above the bridge, but above
or below, ‘tis a boat race for a’ that, and a boat race is
Commencement to me.

How the years roll back to the ’70’s and the ‘80's!
We had our pair of horses or the buggy for all day.
Sheridan’s and Wright's hired their stock for the whole
day, and we had to get our money’s worth—money was
worth a lot more in those days—and we would make
an engagement with our young lady—they weren't
‘dates’ in our time—and before breakfast we would
go down to the river to see our crew pull over the
course, and size up our chances for the big event on
which we had pinned our hopes and put all our money.

Well, I was an Albert Sydney, and I am proud of
it, even though the hated Harry Lees did manage to
nose us out oftener than I care to remember, which
isn’t any reflection on us because you know how they
named their shell “Annie Joe,” and after that, well,
I suppose it was all right, but we didn’t have anybody
to look after us the way Miss Annie mothered that
Harry Lee crew. I don’t cherish any grudge, but I’m
coming back this time to put my roll on old Albert
Sydney, and I feel in my bones that we are going to
get our revenge. But if we don't, well, they'll know
that they’ve been in a boat race, and we old boys will
have one good time.

These youngsters don’t know the thrill of a bright
June afternoon on the tow-path with every house-yard
and field along the way crowded with pretty girls and
their escorts and their chaperones in buggies and car-
riages, while those so fortunate as to have saddle horses
could gallop down the tow-path after Old Alec, and
see him fire the pistol as the starting signal and then
follow the boats all the way up the river. That was
the life.

I can stand all the rest of it, speeches and swallow-
tails and the whole of it, if I know that the big thing
is going to be a real boat race between the Harry Lee
and the Albert Sydney crews. That is a tradition,
sacred to all those of the old days. Golf and tennis
and contract bridge are all well enough for those as
likes "em, but real he-men like the fellows of our time
want to see a boat race, not as a minor event but as a
main attraction.

Now, if I can pick up an old Harry Lee and we
can get a pair of saddle horses, we will start before
breakfast and all day long we will abuse and threaten
and insult each other, and in the evening we will sit
down—if we can sit down—to a good dinner and get
maudlin over old times. ‘That will be one perfect day
in June. ;

Well, so long, we'll be seeing you at Commence-

ment. ,

Helderman to Study Geo. Tucker

Dr. LEONARD C. HELDERMAN, associate professor
of history at Washington and Lee University, and re-
cently recognized by the Social Science Research Coun-
cil in its annual awards, recently stated that the council's
appointment to study George Tucker as a social scien-
tist in the Old South will be undertaken immediately
following the close of the University session.

In granting a fellowship to Dr. Helderman, the
Social Science Council, a nationally endowed founda-
tion for study and research work among the various
fields of social science, again recognized the ability of
the Washington and Lee history teacher. Dr. Helder-
man previously had been given an award by the coun-
cil for the study of George Washington as a patron of
learning.

George Tucker, who will be the subject of Dr.
Helderman’s study, has been given historical recogni-
tion as a builder of culture and learning in the South.
Appointed professor of political science and chairman
of the faculty by Thomas Jefferson when the Univer-
sity of Virginia was founded, he acted as head of the
institution for a period of twenty years. A former
representative from Virginia in the early Congress, he
was also author of a number of novels, biographies,
and books on history and economics. <A study of these
books and a critical analysis of their contributions will
constitute the major portion of Dr. Helderman’s study.

Dr. Helderman will temporarily divert his atten-
tion from a history of Washington and Lee University
which he had commenced last year. He is the author
of “George Washington: Patron of Learning,” and
“National and State Banks,” which won the Hart
Schaffner and Marx prize in 1929.

OBITUARS.

REV. WILBUR COSBY BELL, D.D., ’07

Tue Rev. Wivsur Cossy BE tt, D. D. professor
of Systematic Divinity at the Virginia Theological Sem-
inary, died on April 6, after a short illness. His widow,
the former Miss Anne Lee Laird, daughter of the late
William H. Laird, survives him.

Dr. Bell was born in Augusta County, Va., in 1881,
the son of Samuel Hendron and Ellen Cosby Bell.
He graduated from Hampden-Sydney College in 1900
and the Virginia Theological Seminary in 1905, being
ordained deacon in that year and priest in 1906 by
Bishop Randolph of the Diocese of Southern Virginia.
He attended Washington and Lee for one year, 1907.
He received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from
Washington and Lee University in 1914, from Prince-
ton in 1929, and the Cambridge Theological School in
the same year. He spent his diaconate as minister of
Trinity Church, Onancock, and was rector of R. E. Lee
Memorial church, Lexington, Virginia, from 1906 to
1911; going thence to the rectorship of St. Andrew's
Church, Louisville, Ky., in 1911. In 1912 he was
called to the chair of Systematic Divinity and Apolo-
getics of the Virginia Seminary.

Dr. Bell was one of the notable men o1 the Virginia
Seminary, a strong, clear thinker and able preacher.
He was the author of several books, Sharing in Crea-
tion, published in 1925, and The Making of Man, in
1930. In 1929 he delivered the Paddock Lectures at
the General Theological Seminary. During the World
War he served overseas as chaplain in the Rainbow
Division.

The Literary Digest of May 20, 1933, carried the
following article:

 

 

 

Deatu As “Just AN INCIDENT”

Instantly his face brightened when his wife told
him the end was near, and he said: “Isn't that inter-
esting ?”

Miraculously, it seemed, his pulse strengthened,
and Dr. W. Cosby Bell, “one of the great spirits of the
Episcopal Church,” talked with his wife an hour be-
fore the light went out.

Remembering his often-exprest wish to face death
while still conscious, Mrs. Bell had told her husband
that it was the time of fulfillment. A part of what was
said in that last hour was a message to the students of
the Virginia ‘Theological Seminary, of whose faculty
Dr. Bell was a distinguished member. The message is
quoted by The Churchman (Episcopal) thus:

[ 25 ]

“Tell the boys that I've grown surer of God every
year of my life, and I’ve never been so sure as I am
right now.

Why, it’s all so!—it’s a fact—it’s a dead certainty.
I'm so glad to find that I haven't the least shadow of
shrinking or uncertainty. . .I’'ve been preaching and
teaching these things all my life, and I’m so interested
to find that all we've been believing and hoping is so.
I've always thought so, and now that i'm right up
against it, I know. . .Tell them I say ‘good-by’—they've
been a joy to me.

“T’'ve had more than any man that ever lived, and
life owes me nothing. I’ve had work I leved, and I've
lived in a beautiful place among congeniai friends. I’ve
had love in its highest form, and I’ve got it forever. . .
I can see now that death is just the smallest thing—
just an incident—that it means nothing.”

‘‘No one who knew Dr. Bell would find in the mes-
sage anything but absolute consistency with his life,”
comments The Churchman. “It is impossible to read
it without recalling the words from the Cross, ‘It is
finished.’ A rare life, rounded and perfected, a por-
trait of the Master.”

P. K. GOREE, ’68, Courier of General Lee

THE Houston Post of May 7 publishes the fol-
lowing account of the death of P. K. Goree, of the class
of 1868, a courier of General Lee, who, after peace,
followed his leader to Washington and Lee:

“Mr. Goree had served under Lee as a courier in
the Confederate Army, and was near him when the
Army of Northern Virginia laid down its arms at Ap-
pomattox Court House.

“Mr. Goree was born in the Judson Institute, in
Marion, Ala., May 22, 1845. His mohter at that time
was matron of the college. His father, Dr. Langston
Goree, was the college physician. The family came to
Texas in 1850 and settled in Huntsville. Later they
moved across the Trinity river and bought a farm that
now adjoins the Eastham prison farm. Dr. Goree died
soon afterward and was buried there.

“The family then moved to Madison county and
established their home on what is known as the Moffett
old place, now owned by Albert Connor. Later the
family moved to Midway, where Mr. Goree made his
permanent home and where he died.

“In the spring of 1863, Mr. Goree, then almost
18 years old, went to Virginia and joined Hood’s ‘Texas
brigade, a unit of General Lee’s army. He was de-
tailed as a courier at the headquarters of the division
commander, Major General Charles Fields. In the
important position of courier, Mr. Goree was in sev-
eral major conflicts, notably the battles of the Wilder-
ness, Spottsylvania Court House and Cold Harbor,
and was in the siege of Petersburg, which ended in
April 1865, when General Lee withdrew his army and,
after several days of marching and fighting, was forced
to surrender. Mr. Goree arrived at his Madison county
home about six weeks later and set about to help his
mother and brothers rebuild their depleted fortune.

“Mr. Goree returned to Virginia in 1867 to enter
college. With him was his friend, later to become his
brother-in-law, Hugh L. Hayes, and his nephew, the
late Judge Norman G. Kittrell of Houston. Mr. Goree
has many times said it caused him great rejoicing at
the time of his matriculation that General Lee recog-
nized him as the courier boy who had delivered mes-
sages at his headquarters during the “times that tried
men’s souls,” and greeted him cordially.

“Mr. Goree was married to Miss Melissa Young
of Midway, June 11, 1876. Three years later they
built their home, where they lived continuously. Mrs.

Goree died October 19, 1930.

“Mr. Goree’s mother was an intimate friend of
Mrs. Sam Houston, both before and after the latter’s
marriage. She baked Mrs. Houston’s wedding cake

I

m .A..S. fe 2-2

and was one of the bridesmaids at the Houston mar-
riage in Huntsville. As long as both families resided
in Huntsville, the close friendship was maintained.

“The pioneer spirit of Mr. Goree, his stability of
character and his patriotism reflected in his five daugh-
ters and three sons. The oldest daughter was the only
issue of his first marriage. They, like their father, take
an active interest in political affairs and m the welfare
of the church to which they owe allegiance.”

A friend of CHESTERFIELD
writes us of a salesman who had
“something to say”:

“JT dropped into a little to-
bacco shop, and when I asked
for a pack of Chesterfields
the man smiled and told me
I was the seventh customer
without a break to ask for
Chesterfields. ‘Smoker after
smoker,’ he said, ‘tells me
that Chesterfields click... I
sell five times as many Chest-

erfields as I did a while back.’ ”

Yes, there’s something to say
about Chesterfields and it takes
just six words to say it—““They’re

mild and yet they satisfy.”
