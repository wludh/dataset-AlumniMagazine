Education As Growth

(The President‚Äôs Page)

GENTLE smile broke over several faces of the adminis-
A trative group this summer when we read a letter from
a mother of an incoming freshman asking whether her son
‚Äúwould meet nice girls under proper conditions.‚Äù I an-
swered that letter seriously‚Äîand somewhat
proudly‚Äîreminding the lady that within fifty

 

miles of us are four fine colleges for girls and
advising that her boy would almost certainly
have a chance to go over to one or more of these
schools. The mother was profoundly right in a
kind of deep instinct; she knew that education
means much more than the grades recorded ; and
we couldn‚Äôt argue that she was wrong in feeling
that her particular point was important.

*K XK **

A great service of liberal education 1s to pro-
vide stimulus and environment for growth, growth in ev-
ery worthy manifestation of personality.

K K K

To stand for a minute in the currents and cross-cur-
rents of student activity is almost bewildering. The boys
stream from a football game that has agitated them in-
tensely‚Äîthough we older ones know that it doesn‚Äôt make
a world of difference which team got the touchdown. A
committee bars the ‚ÄúBig Apple‚Äù at the dances of the next
week-end; a newspaper article carries a significant an-
nouncement about the literary societies ; some of the boys
hurry for supper to be back in time for band practice ; this
group is coaxing a professor to talk at the next meeting
of the International Relations Club; here a fraternity
house is gay with its house-party ; a boy with a song-book
is selecting something to be sung at the next meeting of
the Friendship Council, the voluntary and informal gath-
erings to discuss religious problems or opinions ; in a base-
ment room, a little group toils furiously to get out the next
issue of the college newspaper on time.

*x* *¬´ *

It all has nothing to do with that fine business of mas-
tering the fragments of knowledge detailed in the curri-
culum‚Äîwhich is, of course, the primary reason for the
presence of those boys on the campus. A few wise men
might shake their heads in dismay over the fashion in
which these youths fritter away time on matters of sec-
ondary value.

io

 

But we must not be too hasty in discounting values as
secondary. Summoned before Pharoah for the supreme
moment of a matchless opportunity, Joseph took time to
shave and dress himself at his very best. He knew that
personality would count, and nothing that he
could do by way of preparation was trivial.
Thus, let us say, Washington and Lee boys have
scriptural sanction even for their insistence upon
decency of attire.

Modern education began in a monastic at-
mosphere. Men embraced knowledge as a kind
of asceticism. In our country, the older epochs
saw education‚Äîcertainly on the higher levels‚Äî
as academic isolation, a voluntary separation
from the world of affairs for a period of medi-
tation. This is not to say that red-blooded boys always ac-
cepted such an attitude. Today, however, there is empha-
sis, and a very proper emphasis, upon education as a pro-
cess of adjustment, a fitting of the young life for its ef-
fective place in the world. The campus becomes a kind of
anticipatory pattern of the great complex social order.
Thus the capacity leadership is developed. Herein is one
of the supreme functions of modern education.

ok 7K 3K

A theory has found some favor among educators to
the effect that a highly gifted boy should be allowed to
‚Äúeat up the curriculum‚Äù as fast as he can chew and digest
it; if he can do four years of class-room work in six
months, give him his degree at the end of six months.
Such a theory should be carefully scrutinized. Probably
the highly gifted boy, more even than his fellows, needs
the slow maturing, the leisurely growth of personality
which is promoted by such multitudinous activities as the
modern campus affords. Certainly boys who, having a
sharp talent for specialization, go from high school into
the limited professional courses endanger some of the
most advantageous factors for growth, those found in the
larger process of learning to appreciate, learning to think,
learning to live socially before learning to do.

A Professoef urns Nevalist

By RicuHarp P. CARTER

AWRENCE FE. WATKIN, novelist, struck five successive
| matches in a vain effort to light his pipe. Methodically,
as no smoke came from the briar, he reached into a top
drawer of his modernistic desk and extracted half a dozen
folders of paper matches and tried again.

That was too much for the stubborn pipe, and Watkin
smiled as smoke curled forth. Then he answered my ques-
tion, ‚ÄúIs it much fun to be the author of a book
that promises to become a best seller?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, [ll tell you,‚Äù he said, and
| wondered if he had developed a
Bob Burns complex or some-
thing (and he hadn't), ‚Äúwell,
I'll tell you, I get a big kick
out of it. Who wouldn't ?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd this story about
vour book being pro-
duced on Broadway‚Äî
is it true? Don‚Äôt you get
an even bigger kick out
of the prospect of ap-
pearing at your first
night performance when
‚ÄòOn Borrowed Time‚Äô is
dramatized ?‚Äù Watkin puffed
his pipe. ‚Äú‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù he
said,

‚ÄúOn Borrowed Time,‚Äô Wat-
kin‚Äôs enthusiastically received first
novel, was published early in September by
Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., of New York City. It
has been attracting increased attention from
reviewers throughout the United States, and
on October 4 it was listed by the New York Times as one
of the best sellers in two widely separated cities‚ÄîSan
rancisco and New Orleans,

Professor Watkin, to use the strictly academic form of

 

address for a paragraph or so, has been assistant professor
of English at Washington and Lee University since the
fall of 1926.

He has been responsible, to great degree, for the rise
to national fame of the Washington and Lee Troubadours,
the University student dramatic organization, and was the
driving force behind the erection of the Troubadour Thea-
ter at Lexington.

Several of Watkin‚Äôs plays‚Äîhe has tried his hand at
drama as well as novels‚Äîhave been produced with success

    
  
  
 
  
   
   
  
  
 

Lawrence E. Watkin

by the Troubadours, and he has directed the group in some
other notable efforts.

The author of ‚ÄúOn Borrowed Time‚Äù was born at
Camden, N. Y., in 1901. He took his A. B. from Syracuse,
where the theme of his book was conceived. Then he went
to Harvard for his M. A., and after receiving that degree
taught for one year at Syracuse. The rest of his life has
been spent at Washington and Lee, but he has
spent three summers doing graduate work
at Columbia University.

Watkin‚Äôs first play, ‚ÄòPeace
Hath Her Victories,‚Äù was pro-
duced by the Troubadours in
the spring of 1932 as part
of Washington and Lee‚Äôs
observance of the George

Washington bicentennial.

The following fall he as-

sumed direction of the

Troubadours; the so-

ciety has been one of

his major interests since
that time. Since the 1932
play, he has written two
other pieces which have been
produced by the Trouba-
dours. They were ‚ÄúMr. Painter‚Äôs
Palace of Pleasure‚Äù and ‚ÄúTo-
morrow Appears.‚Äô‚Äô It was from
‚ÄúTomorrow Appears‚Äù that Watkin took
the main character for ‚ÄúOn Borrowed Time.‚Äù
However, he says he ‚Äúgreatly modified‚Äù this
main character, one individual named Gramp
whose antics in keeping death up a tree have delighted
readers of the novel.

‚ÄúOn Borrowed Time,‚Äô Watkin admits freely, is a fan-
tasy, woven around this unusual theme:

Death, in the person of Mr. Brink, irritates Gramp,
who chases him up a tree and keeps him there while the
characters involved in borr wing time for living extricate
themselves from delightfull | readable situations. Then, in-
evitably, Mr. Brink is freed from the strange powers by
which Gramp held him aloft, and comes down from the
tree to end it all.

But it‚Äôs not as simple as that. It‚Äôs a well told tale, laid
in New England and written in entertaining vein by this

The Literary Societies ‚ÄúMerge‚Äù

By GEORGE STUYVESANT JACKSON
Assistant Professor of English at Washington and Lee

N 1936, when Washington College was internally torn
down and rebuilt, there vanished with the rest of the
wreckage the halls in which the Graham-Lee and the
Washington Literary Societies had been meeting more or
less steadily since 1826 when the building was completed.
Nobody will be surprised to learn that when the uni-
versity undertook this renovation, it did not ask permis-
sion from the incumbent members of the two societies ; yet
it is alleged that a legal case might have been constructed
through which the societies might have
secured an injunction against President
Gaines and the Board of Trustees. The
sophomores in charge were indulgent
enough, however, to let the Board pro-
ceed !

Nevertheless, the fact remained that
the University had undoubtedly thrown
tenants out into the cold who had stuck
for one hundred and ten years; and
Washington and Lee, like a good land-
lord, quickly made provision for re-
housing them.

On the second floor of the new Stu-
dent Union there is an excellent hall,
dedicated solely to the work of the lit-
erary societies. In general appearance
it is just like all the other rooms of the
Student Union, with neutral-colored
walls and tiled flooring in red and black.
It is large enough to seat perhaps
seventy-five people comfortably.

Otherwise it is different. On a plat-
form across the long wall opposite the door are the three
old mahogany desks and chairs, presented long ago to the
Graham-Lee Society by William Moseley Brown and Eu-
gene B. Gary. These are the same that always stood so im-
pressively in the old hall in Washington College. The rest
of the chairs in the room are also the originals in which
the society members used to sit. The doors are originals,
too. Before the old building was remodeled, they were
taken from the former Graham-Lee room and replaced in
the new hall, which was designed by the architect to fit
them. By an unfortunate oversight, these doors were al-
lowed to be painted to match the rest of the gray in the
Union Building‚Äîa very natural error, but a pity since it
took away their individuality. There is but one ancient key
to the door, and the students, many of whom feel that the

 

 

George S. Jackson

society made an extremely bad bargain years ago in allow-
ing others to use their room, are guarding it jealously.

The fact, however, that there is now but a single hall,
where there used to be two, is one motive for the change in
the society programs, a change we hope will work out so
that we shall be glad we were deprived of half our property.

To understand this change, it is necessary to glance
at the societies‚Äô recent history. They were in their full
glory during the late nineteenth century, the heyday for
literary societies in American ‚Äòcolleges
throughout the country. It was these or-
ganizations at Washington and Lee that
furnished much of the campus compe-
tition now taken over by organized ath-
letics and a dozen other activities. It
was they that brought outside speakers,
that held a gala celebration once a year,
that furnished entertainment in the
form of hard-fought inter-society de-
bates ; that gave the college the nucleus
for its library.

It was probably with the twentieth
century that their decline began, but
this was not noticed until after the war.
New forms of entertainment then ar-
rived; it eventually became ridiculous
to suppose that mere society meetings
could be held on Saturday nights as had
been the custom. The Washington So-
ciety was disbanded for several years;
Graham-Lee hobbled along as best it
could.

In 1933 the administration decided to drop a course in
freshman public speaking which had been offered up to
that time, and in casting about for a fit substitute, Dean
Tucker thought of the literary societies. It was decided
that one hour's credit could be offered to freshmen and
sophomores who elected to meet with them regularly. At
the same time, enthusiastic students revived Washington,
thus giving the credit-seekers a choice of two groups.

During the four years from then to the present, much
has been accomplished in the way of rebuilding the shat-
tered literary clubs. They have both functioned regularly,
with meetings and programs. Entertaining and educa-
tional work has been done, and many students have bene-
fited to the extent of getting the necessary start towards
platform speaking‚Äîthe ability to stand on their feet

[5]

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

 

and be coherent. The college recognized, of course, that
this was not enough training and therefore increased ad-
vanced public speaking to a full year rather than the one
semester to which this course had shrunk during the de-
pression.

In spite of our relative success, we had plenty of diffi-
culties. One was that we could never decide whether we
were a regular college course, or whether we were an
extra-curricular activity with incidental college credit. This
quandary may sound like academic hair-splitting, but ac-
tually it was real and very disturbing. Some of the men
thought they were taking a course of instruction and drop-
ped out when they found the programs included compara-
tively little training or other interference from the faculty
adviser. Others tended
to resent the demands
made upon their so-
ciety by the college and
dropped out because
the work reminded
them of the classroom.
We found that while
it is possible to arouse
enthusiasm for a stu-
dent activity on the
basis of competition
and individual loyalty,
the average boy is un-
likely to go wild over
anything called Public
Speaking 101 (which
is the title given us by
the catalogue). These
are but a few of the
problems we have faced and still do face to some extent.

Usually it was a few faithful ones who conducted the
meetings, arranged for the programs‚Äîwhether of de-
bates, mock trials, extemporaneous speaking, oratory or
and probably did most of the preparation for

 

what not
the programs themselves. Inter-society competition once
or twice a semester was usually excellent but was rather
too infrequent. A fine silver cup offered by the college to
the winner of these competitions helped, but Washington,
last year, gained final possession of it. This required win-
ning two out of three debates three years in succession, a
factor which Dr. Tucker and I had thought would keep
the cup in circulation for years!

At any rate, the students most closely interested in the
societies : Robert and Southgate Hoyt and Edgar Shannon
of Graham-Lee, and Hugh Avery of Washington, agreed
with me that we ought to find a way to make competition
between the societies keener, and to get away from the ne-
cessity we had been laboring under of having one club
meet in the downstairs lounge. (A Washington and Lee

 

Student Union, Where Literary Societies Meet

student‚Äôs time is so crowded with one obligation and an-
other that it 1s impossible to hold meetings for either
group any night but Monday at 7:30, so that one society
was crowded out of a regular hall.) We all felt that we
had built the work up as far as it would.go under the sys-
tem we had been using and that the time had come for a
new departure.

We thought of many fine schemes that could be car-
ried out with a little money, and we considered the im-
provement that would result if we had more recognition
on the campus. Where the former would come from we
hadn't the slightest idea ; but we knew that the latter could
be obtained only through our own merit. Hugh Avery, as
president of Washington, had already tried getting promi-
nent speakers for his
outfit, and had at-
tempted to lead a move-
ment to meet with
leaders of other col-
lege literary societies
in the state to discuss
common problems.
Presidents Shannon
and Hoyt of Graham-
Lee had sent out en-
graved bids to their in-
coming freshmen and
had put on a formal
initiation. These expe-
dients were good ones,
but they did not sat-
isfy us.

It was at this point
that Mr. F. E. Lund
of the Washington and Lee faculty, who had studied at
the University of Toronto, came to our aid by suggesting
that we emulate the Toronto literary societies which are
modeled after the Oxford Union. For further aid in un-
derstanding this system we had Professors Fitzgerald
Flournoy and Larkin Farinholt who, as Rhodes Scholars,
had participated in meetings of the Oxford Union itself.

The new plan was worked out last spring by a com-
mittee consisting of Professors Latture, Flournoy, Lund,
and myself, in conjunction with the above-mentioned stu-
dents and with the advice of Dr. Shannon; and our rec-
ommendations were accepted by Dean Tucker.

Following is a description of the plan adopted:

All regular weekly meetings of the societies will be
joint meetings. (Any separate meetings of individual so-
cieties will be their own business, and probably will be in
the nature of party caucuses.) Inter-society competition
will be the order of each meeting, but this competition will
be held as if the two societies were the two parties in a

legislature. (Continued on page thirteen)

Memphis‚Äô Youngest Bank Vice-President

EET ALLEN MorGan, if you don‚Äôt already know him.
And if you know him, meet him again, because he is
fast becoming one very worth knowing, especially in bank-
ing circles. If you‚Äôre of the class of 1929, you‚Äôve sampled
the persistence that has
won him promotion in
the world of finance.
(Editor's Note: I know
he‚Äôs carefully, thor-
oughly persistent be-
cause New
York and he was in
Memphis last year, and
he did one fine job of
carrying on the Class
Agent campaign‚Äîlet-
ters, postcards, et cetera,
et cetera; I was disap-
pointed when he didn't
finally telegraph.‚Äî
RP. C.)
Allen has just been

I was in

 

made a vice-president of
the First National Bank
of Memphis. That‚Äôs only
half the story:

He is the youngest
vice-president on record
in the financial history
of his Tennessee me-
tropolis. He is twenty-
nine years old.

Allen was graduated
from Washington and
Lee in 1929, and became
associated with the First
National Bank in June
of that year.

Banker Morgan is a
reticent person, careful,
to judge from his let-
ters, to speak not-too-rapidly of his accomplishments. A
newspaper clipping that wound its way to the Washing-
ton and Lee Alumni Office, however, tells part of the

story: ‚ÄúGraduating from the school of business manage-
ment of Washington and Lee University, he (Morgan)
became associated with the bank in June, 1929, and

has won wide recognition as an authority on municipal

[

 

N

and securities.‚Äù The Memphis newspaper that

printed this comment thought enough of Allen‚Äôs accom-

bonds

plishments to run a picture of him along with the story.

The Alumni Office asked Allen for some biographical
material, and he sum-
med himself up so terse-
ly, yet so well, that the
best way to tell the story
seems to be to reprint
his letter. Here it is:

‚ÄúT am today sending
under separate cover a
picture for you to use in
your alumni magazine.
It is certainly nice of
you to give me all the
free advertising and
maybe I can dig up a
bank account as the re-
sult of it.

‚ÄòYou asked for a bi-
ographical sketch since
leaving college. There is
not much to tell. As you
know, I am still single
and living at home. I
started with the Bond
Department of this
bank in 1929, working
under Norfleet Turner,
who is a Washington
and lee graduate, class
of about 1924, I believe.
He was manager of the
Bond Department up
until 1934 when I suc-
ceeded him, and he has
since been made Execu-
Vice-President of

this bank. I was made a

Vice-President as of
July 1. My outside activities are of no particular conse-
quence, except that I am a member of the Rotary Club and
a few social organizations.

tion of Frank J. Gilliam, dean of students at Washington
and Lee, is open to all freshmen. Its capacity, however, is
limited to 125 because of lack of accommodations. The
quota is filled on a first-apply, first-served basis.

Enrollment at the University was 922 on October 1.
Thirty-five states are represented in the student body, as
well as Hawaii, Mexico, Peru, and Puerto Rico.

One particular thing stands out in registration this
year so far as alumni of the University are concerned‚Äî
seventy-eight of those registered are sons of alumni of
Washington and Lee.

Twenty-eight of these sons of alumni are first year
men. The others are returning students.

The 78 students, with the exception of several who did
not appear for the photographer, are pictured in the large

Washington and Lee‚Äôs renovation program, for the
time, has been completed with the rearrangement and re-
modeling of interiors of many of the buildings. Exteriors
have been retouched but otherwise they have been left as
they were in order to preserve the architectural beauty of
the University.

Automobile-driving alumni who return for homecom-
ing November 6 will find one welcome change‚Äîthe road
back of the University (the road that circles behind Wash-
ington College and winds its way out just north of the law
building) has been hard-surfaced.

Internally, ‚Äúthe work of the University has gone for-
ward in a satisfactory way,‚Äù Dr. Robert H. Tucker, dean
of the University, said. ‚ÄúCourse requirements have been
kept up to standard. Student performance has been credit-
able in the classroom as well as in other phases of campus

life.‚Äù
ae

One hundred and thirteen Washington and Lee stu-
dents attained ‚Äò‚Äòdean‚Äôs list‚Äù ratings for this semester. All
maintained an average in class work of not less than ‚ÄúB‚Äù
during the second semester last year.

Dean‚Äôs list men are the university‚Äôs ‚Äúprivileged scho-
lastic class‚Äù; they are allowed unrestricted absences from
class so long as their work is regarded by the dean‚Äôs office

as satisfactory.

THREE WASHINGTON AND LEE professors went on
leave of absence this year, two of them to the University
of North Carolina for graduate work and the other to Co-
lumbia University.

John Higgins Williams, assistant professor of politi-
cal science, and Donald F. Martin, assistant professor of
economics, are studying at Carolina; Earle K. Paxton, as-

sociate professor of mathematics, is taking graduate work
at Columbia.

Other faculty and administrative changes for the 1937-
1938 session included appointment of Miss Susan Lancas-
ter as acting librarian. She succeeds Miss Blanche Mc-
Crum, who resigned during the summer to accept the li-
brarianship at Wellesley.

Miss Lancaster, a native Virginian, formerly was di-
rector of the library of the American College in Istanbul.
She was at Hampden-Sydney College last year, engaged
in cataloging the library.

Mervyn Crobaugh, Ph. D., who has served on the
Washington and Lee faculty before, was appointed assist-
ant professor of economics to take Mr. Martin‚Äôs place.
Instructor C. A. Barrell, named to the faculty last year
during the absence of Assistant Professor F. James
Barnes, remained to fill in for Mr. Williams. Mr. Barnes,
who has been on leave to do graduate work at North
Carolina, returned. Allen W. Moger, assistant professor
of history, also returned from leave, at Columbia.

Charles M. Williams, an A. M. from Harvard, was
named instructor in mathematics to serve during Mr. Pax-
ton‚Äôs absence.

Two new instructors assumed their duties this month.
They are Lewis D. Williams, who was graduated from
Washington and Lee last June, named laboratory instruc-
tor in chemistry ; and A. G. Steer, graduate of Haverford,
instructor in modern languages.

*x* *

Social activities for the year at Washington and Lee
started October 25 with the sophomore prom, the first
of the opening set of dances, held in Doremus Gym-
nasium.

Saturday night, October 16, the Cotillion Club dance
was held with King Jones of Sweetwater, Tennessee,
president of the Cotillion Club, leading the figure with
Miss Sarah Thompson of Chattanooga, Tennessee, a stu-
dent at Randolph-Macon Woman's College.

Jones engaged a professional decorator to decorate the
gym for the two dances and the dansant on Saturday aft-
ernoon. Recent regulations passed by the dance control
committee of Washington and Lee barring the ‚ÄúBig Ap-
ple‚Äù were in effect for the dances, for which Don Bestor
and his orchestra played.

x -*¬´ *

Homecoming on November 6 will be the occasion for
further social events on the campus. The Monogram Club
will hold its annual dance that Saturday evening follow-
ing the Virginia game. Homecoming activities actually will
start Friday afternoon, November 5, when the Washing-
ton and Lee freshmen meet the V. P. I. yearlings.

Watkin's Book To Become Broadway Play

(Continued from page four)

northerner who has adopted the Old Dominion for living.

I asked Professor Watkin how long it took to write
‚ÄúOn Borrowed Time.‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout one month,‚Äù he said, and added, ‚Äú‚Äòwhile I was
at the seashore.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wrote the whole thing in one month ?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I did, but it required a year to revise the book,
deleting and putting in sections until I had it just right.‚Äù

But Watkin
would just as

Under present plans, the book will be produced on
sroadway before Christmas. It is to be put into produc-
tion as soon as a cast can be selected when its adaptation
is completed.

Paul Osborn, well-known author of ‚ÄúThe Vinegar
Tree,‚Äù has been engaged to adapt the book for stage pur-
poses.

Watkin, scanning fan mail (including a letter from
Faith Bald-
win), said he

the Trouba-

was ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù
that his novel

 

dours as about
writing books.
The Trouba-
dour Theater
has been called
the ‚Äò‚ÄòSouth‚Äôs
most remark-
able little thea-
ter,‚Äô and in it
some fine acting
and some bad
acting ‚Äî has
ach

 

been done
year.

The Troub-
adours under
Watkin aim
high. This fall
they sought per-
mission from
Noel Coward to produce his unproduced ‚ÄúPost Mortem.‚Äù
The playwright, however, decided that the play should not
be done.

Shortly after the Troubadour Theater was opened,
Watkin said :

‚ÄúThe Troubadours have no thought of developing pro-
fessional actors. We are not conducting a school for fu-
ture Broadway stars.‚Äù

Yet members of the Troubadours of recent years have
found their way to the stage. Tom Coley, of Philadelphia,
was given bits in New York productions; Charles Blake,
of Louisville, directed plays in Indiana and did some mo-
tion picture work. There are others in dramatic work.

So back to ‚ÄúOn Borrowed Time‚Äù

John Hay Whitney acquired the dramatic production
rights to the novel shortly after its publication.

 

A Washington and Lee Troubadour Group

was so well ac-
cepted.

‚ÄúT feel,‚Äù he
said, ‚Äú‚Äòthat the
critics have
given me more
than a fair
break.‚Äù‚Äô And the
‚Äò‚Äòfair break‚Äô‚Äô
came, he add-
ed, when he
thought all the
time that ‚ÄúOn
Borrowed
Time‚Äô‚Äô would
provide merely

:
BS

‚Äògood light

summer read-
ing.‚Äù

Mr. Watkin
hopes to write another book some time soon, but isn‚Äôt ‚Äú‚Äòin
a particular hurry about it.‚Äù The next novel, he confided
to me and to the pipe, will be ‚Äúabout suburban New York-
ers, who, because they have taken root, are too stubborn
to move out of undesirable sections.‚Äù

That‚Äôs going to be a ‚Äúmore telling satire,‚Äù the English
professor continued. ‚ÄòMuch of the satire in ‚ÄòOn Borrowed
Time‚Äô is overlooked.‚Äù

[ asked Watkin for some of the reviews before writ-
ing this piece about him, and he handed over an old brown
envelope stuffed with them. They are numerous, but per-
haps the most significant one is reproduced here, through
courtesy of the New York Times.

Here it is, as written by Alfred Kazin in the New
York Times Book Section of September 12:

The most charming, and in a sense the most moving,

[11]

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

 

of the myths we associate with the childhood of a race or
an individual concerns the personification of death. To
those who believe that death is not a frog in the throat but
a human stranger, perhaps a whimsical and kindly one,
the fear of life becomes as inconsequential as the fear of
death. It is only a sickly paganism, or what is worse, being
even less radiant‚Äîtheology without genuine piety‚Äîthat
unnerves men at the very end. The child (like Mr. Wat-
kin‚Äôs Pud) is unafraid because he has seen something ;
and with shy grace he believes that his vision is a more
comforting form of that which men recoil from in a series
of nervous abstractions.

Any story with such a personification is essentially a
folk tale ; and a good deal of the charm and native breezi-
ness of Mr. Watkin‚Äôs story is due to the simplicity of line
and spirit with which he has fused an ancient myth and a
kindly, homespun satire. The good-humored freshness of
the tale invites the necessary suspension of belief, for in
any world where men sit on porch steps and mock the
stars and each other so happily, it is long-nosed pedantry
to cavil at their version of Death. One believes in Mr.
Brink (who is Death with a right smart way of talkin‚Äô) as
one believes in Pud and his salty Grandpa; and one be-
lieves in him all the more, I think, because he is even less
imposing. Dostoevsky made the Devil an English fop,
which was a profound thing to do; Mr. Watkin converts
Death into a tired, excessively sober little gent with a great
fondness for circumlocutions.

Before Mr. Brink came along, life at the Northrups had
been very pleasant indeed. When Pud‚Äôs father and mother
were killed in an automobile accident, Grandpa and Miss
Nellie took over and things went on with gusto. Trouble
broke out when Mr. Brink, flushed with success in taking
Miss Nellie away one night, decided to visit Grandpa, too.
Now Grandpa had licked a good many Johnny Rebs in
1865, not to mention the heathen Spaniards he had taken
a shot at on San Juan Hill, and there were a lot of things
he hadn‚Äôt seen, being in his early eighties. Dying, Grandpa
was convinced, was a silly thing to do, particularly since
Pud was a mere five, and there was every chance in the
world that his silly aunt, Demetria Riffle (Holier-than-
thou Demetria) might get the boy if that Mr. Brink got
him.

When Mr. Brink came along, therefore, he was coldly
received. Couldn‚Äôt, Grandpa suggested, Mr. Brink wait
just a little? In his academic and rather stuffy way, Mr.
Brink retorted that he couldn‚Äôt. Um! thought Grandpa, and
pointed to his apple tree. ‚ÄúI wondered if you'd kindly fetch
me one of those yellow transparents from the south side‚Äî
up there where they're the biggest. One last apple would
be a comfort. I hate to leave "em when they‚Äôre spoiling to
be et.‚Äù Mr. Brink, who ‚Äúmust have been a genial fellow at
heart and something of a gymnast,‚Äù obliged. Up into the
tree he went; and up in that tree he remained. There was

a catch to Grandpa‚Äôs request, for he knew, from long ex-
perience with many small boys, that he had a spell over
that tree. Of course, he hadn‚Äôt believed in the spell up to
the moment Mr. Brink got caught, but now he knew.

A little sadly (for he was always decorous) Mr. Brink
protested, and quite firmly and jovially Grandpa insisted
that he stay until Pud‚Äôs twenty-first birthday. A fellow
couldn't die and take any chances on Demetria. . . . Mean-
while suicides lived, poison was no longer poisonous, the
undertakers went hungry, and Congress drew up a reso-
lution begging the local Sheriff to do something about
Grandpa. Grandpa roared his everlasting nay. In fact, he
was having the time of his life, what with all the kimmel
he could absorb with a confident heart and the fact that
Demetria, who was waiting for her star boarder to die
(i. e., his $40,000), was being disappointed. The preachers
protested and Grandpa roared; the undertakers entreated
and Grandpa snickered. No one could see and talk to Mr.
Brink but he; and he wasn‚Äôt giving up his fun, no, sir.

 

‚ÄúAround the Corner‚Äù

ORDINARILY, the ALUMNI MAGAZINE does not go in
for poetry. The following lines, however, seemed unusual
enough to print here. Russell B. Wine, 1912, of San An-
tonio, Texas, sent them along, saying he had received a
‚Äúletter from one of the boys‚Äù enclosing them. He adds
that the poem might serve as a reminder for the reunion
of the class of 1912. Here it is:

AROUND ‚ÄòTHE CORNER

Around the corner, I have a friend,
In this great City that has no end;
Yet days go by and weeks rush on,
And before I know it a year is gone.
And I never see my old friend's face,
For Life is a swift and terrible race.
He knows I like him just as well

As in the days when I rang his bell
And he rang mine. We were younger then,
And now we are busy, tired men‚Äî
Tired with playing a foolish game,
Tired of trying to make a name.

‚ÄòTomorrow, say, I will call on Jim,
Just to show that I‚Äôm thinking of him,‚Äù
But tomorrow comes‚Äîand tomorrow goes,
And the distance between us grows and grows;
Around the corner, yet miles away.
‚Äò‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a telegram, Sir.‚Äù ‚ÄúJim died today !‚Äù
And that‚Äôs what we get‚Äîand deserve‚Äîin the end,
Around the corner, a vanished friend.

Literary Societies, ‚ÄòMerged,‚Äô Keep Identities

(Continued from page six)

At the high mahogany desk, which members of
Graham-lee will remember in their old hall, will sit the
as yet unelected permanent chairman of the Washington
and Lee Forensic Union (the name of the new body‚Äîthe
holding company, as it were, within which the societies
act). He is entirely impartial and there only to preside.
At his right, at one of the lower desks, sits the secretary,
and on the other side the Sergeant at Arms. The two lat-
ter are not officers of the Union but of the Society then in
power. They, and four other officers : the debate secretary
who presents the subjects for debate, the party leader who
is in charge of the debate itself, the custodian who keeps
the key and has charge of the room, and the publicity di-
rector who keeps us in touch with The Ring-tum Phi, are
in power only when their party is in office. The ‚Äúspoils
system‚Äô‚Äù‚Äô is thus recognized in the constitution! The officers
of the Union itself are the chairman and the treasurer.

The chairs in the hall are placed facing each other
across a wide division, and between them is a long table,
situated under the rostrum. At the chairman‚Äôs right will
sit all those who favor the point of view of the ‚Äúgovern-
ment‚Äù (the society which won the last debate), while at
his left sit the members of the ‚Äúopposition.‚Äù On the ‚Äú‚Äògov-
ernment‚Äù side of the table sit the leader of the ‚Äò‚Äògovern-
ment party‚Äù and one or two aides; opposite them are the
equivalent officers of the ‚Äò‚Äòopposition.‚Äù

It must be emphasized that the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Äòop-
position‚Äù are the two traditional societies. They are not
going to lose their identities in any way, but are only meet-
ing for convenience in the same room. They are carrying
on the same rivalry that has distinguished them for 125
years. The freshmen will not be at once members of either
club, but the old members, taking the offices and power,
will attempt to sway as many of them as possible to their
side of the question being debated.

The evening‚Äôs debate on a subject previously presented
by the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù and accepted by the membership of
the whole, is opened by the government leader, followed
by a like presentation speech on the part of the leader of
the ‚Äúopposition.‚Äù‚Äô There are speeches by the aides, and re-
buttal. After this, the floor is open for discussion, and the
members join in. If any member is dissatisfied with his
party‚Äôs stand or convinced by the other side, he shifts his
position to the benches across the way. Eventually a vote
is taken. If the government loses, it falls, and the opposi-
tion comes into power. If not, it stays on through the next
meeting. A government can also fall on a motion of lack
of confidence.

There are, of course, many other details that might be
mentioned, some of which represent problems that have
been solved, some not. For example, the undergraduates
decided that there ought to be a ceremony to indicate the
fall of a government, and this ceremony is to be embodied
in the formal passing of the key to the society room from
its custodian in one society to that officer in the other. It
was decided that if any one government stays in power for
a period longer than four consecutive meetings, it will au-
tomatically fall to give the other side a chance. For one
week the topic debated is to be serious‚Äîthe next hu-
morous.

It is evident that the new plan cannot function unless
all members are open-minded at all times. Should each
man invariably vote blindly for his party, regardless of is-
sue, the result would be an impasse or infinite tenure by
one or the other party.

For the purposes of the new plan, the freshmen are
not to be taken into either club for several weeks. They
are all members of the Forensic Union, but not of
Graham-Lee or Washington. At the end of about two
months, an open ‚Äúrushing season‚Äù will begin. By that time
the leaders of the present societies will know who are the
most powerful speakers among the freshmen and will pre-
sumably try to bring them into the fold first. No doubt,
all will become regular society members in time, but their
election will be in the nature of an honor, indicating that
their ability in speaking is above average.

' Another interesting rule is that nobody is excluded
from the meetings of the Union. All students of the Uni-
versity are invited to attend, speak, and vote on the debate
of the evening. The same applies to the faculty and to
alumni. We should be especially happy to have any of our
alumni join the meetings when they happen to be in town.

We inaugurated the new scheme Monday night, Oc-
tober 4, with an attendance of about forty and a vehement
discussion in which Graham-Lee proposed government
ownership of utilities. The attendance did not indicate our
full membership for various reasons, but those who came
made up for members in oratory, applause, boos and
hisses. Eventually the government case, presented by Wil-
liam Burner, Graham-Lee president, was unable to pre-
vail over an apparently conservative opposition led by
Hugh Avery, acting for Fred Clark, president of Wash-
ington; and the Graham Lee government fell by a vote
of 21-18.

How our experiment will work out, we have no way
of knowing. It has begun most encouragingly, and we

[13]

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

 

have every hope that it will some day result in bringing
the two most historic of Washington and Lee institutions
back to the position they ought to occupy on the campus.
On the other hand, we may be making a serious mistake.
All we can do is to try it out.

Meanwhile, next week the government (Washington)
has elected to defend the proposition, ‚ÄúResolved: That
It Is More Fun To Be a Man Than a Woman.‚Äù On this
proposition I, for one, shall be very glad at last to know
the truth!

‚ÄúLet me know when you (the letter was addressed to
Cy Young) are coming down this way again so that we

Allen added this postscript to his letter :

‚ÄúAfter writing the above letter, it occurred to me that
there is not much to say about my own record, but the
First National Bank was established in 1864, and is the
oldest national bank in the cotton states. Its total assets
are approximately $50,000,000.‚Äù

The Generals Do Gridiron Battle Again

By Wit.iaAM B. BacBEy
Student Assistant, Washington and Lee News Bureau

ELL, here is another autumn in Lexington and an-
Ve edition of the Washington and Lee football
team and this year it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúFighting Generals‚Äù again with
Coach Tilson presenting one of the most spirited squads
in recent years.

The Generals have two victories and one defeat on
their record at the time when this is written; but the lone
defeat was a moral victory for Washington and Lee as
they battled West Virginia to a standstill through more
than three quarters of the game, which was played again
this year at Charleston. The Generals weakened, however,
in the closing minutes of the game to lose to the Moun-
taineers by a score of six to

1934‚Äîwhen they humbled Kentucky in the mud by the
score of seven to nothing and went on to win the Virginia
state title and the Southern Conference championship.

That‚Äôs enough about the remainder of the schedule ex-
cept to remind you that November 6 is Homecoming and
those Wahoos are coming over the Blue Ridge again for
what we hope will be their annual licking. As you know,
they have not been able to score on a Washington and Lee
football team since 1930.

Virginians will get a chance to see what is in store for
the 1938 Generals‚Äô football team when the Brigadiers and
Virginia‚Äôs yearlings clash at Charlottesville on October

22; but more about the fresh-

Thirteen members of the Gen-

erals‚Äô squad of that year were invited to attend a luncheon
at the Kanawha Hotel before the game and to attend the
game in a body, occupying a special box on the sidelines.
Those thirteen were:

James S. McCluer, Parkersburg, W. Va.; W.H. Lisle,
Lexington, Ky.; David M. Barclay, Washington, D. C.;
J. J. Oberlin, Washington, D. C.; J. P. Michler, Los
Angeles, Calif.; B. H. Burr, Birmingham, Ala.; Wallace
Muir, Lexington, Ky.; Dr. R. T. Shields, Shantung,
China; A. G. Snyder, Chevy Chase, Md.; Smith E. Al-
ford, Flushing, N. Y.; H. S. Dixon, Elizabethton, Tenn. ;
William McBrayer Moore, Danville, Ky.; and Norman S.
Fitzhugh, Charleston, W. Va.

It was impossible, of course, for many members of
that group to attend the reunion held in their honor in
Charleston, but we are sure those who were able to attend
were pleased with the stubborn defense which the Gen-
erals put up against the powerful West Virginia eleven.

On October 16 Washington and Lee will invade the
Bluegrass again, hoping to repeat their performance of

place of Amos Bolen, who is
now practicing law in Huntington, West Virginia. Gene
had been head coach at Stephen F. Austin State Teachers
College, Nacagdoches, Texas, since leaving Washington
and Lee.

Arthur W. Glaser, of New York, took the place of
‚ÄúCopenjibe‚Äù this year as trainer. Glaser should be able to
keep Tilson‚Äôs men in good shape this fall, for before com-
ing to Lexington he was trainer for the New York Giants,
one of the outstanding professional football teams.

The Generals donned new uniforms when they opened
the season against Wofford on September 26‚Äînew gold
pants and headgears. They are a snappy looking outfit this
fall and they hope at least to retain the State crown which
they won last season, though they may not be able to over-
come Duke‚Äôs powerful eleven to win Southern Conference
honors. Now for the players themselves: |

Heading the list, of course, is Captain Will Rogers of
Petersburg, Virginia. Will is a very versatile young man;
he not only leads the football team into action each Satur-
day, calling the signals from his center position, but he

both speed and agility, but after the first
game against Wofford, Tilson sent him
back to his old position at guard

of the aerial attack which Washington and Lee should
open up this season.

The fourth member of the backfield quartet 1s a recent
but powerful addition. Merton Howard, called ‚Äò‚Äòthe South
American bull‚Äù by those who have to tackle him, came to
Washington and Lee all the way from Oroya, Peru, via
Principia School in St. Louis, which he attended after
coming to the United States in 1929. He is a junior this
year and until the Generals‚Äô opening game with Wofford
he was merely a substitute fullback. But he showed such
drive in that game that he was pushed into the starting
line-up against Richmond. He scored Washington and
Lee‚Äôs only touchdown against the Spiders, and his punt-
ing at Charleston was the major reason that the Moun-
taineers were able to score only one touchdown against the
Generals. Playing on a very muddy field, his kicks were
consistently over the forty yard mark and kept the Gen-
erals out of danger during most of the game. Howard is
only five feet and eleven inches in height but he carries
two hundred and ten pounds. Coach Tilson, commenting
on the lad‚Äôs fine play, said that the coaching staff had
known for some time of Howard‚Äôs ability but that this
was the first time that he had shown the real football abil-
ity which he possessed. Watch this boy for he should de-
velop more before the season is over.

Among the other lettermen are Bob Long, fullback,
from Abilene, ‚ÄòTexas, a junior who played regularly last
season. He weighs a hundred and seventy and has as much
drive as any of the men among the backs.

Charles Lykes, a junior, from Houston, Texas, is a
capable replacement for Captain Rogers at center and is
noted for his defensive work, particularly his pass de-
fense. In Haskill Dickinson, Birnie Harper, and Shack
Parrish, Coach Tilson has capable replacements for one
whole side of a line, Parrish, being a guard; Dickinson, a
tackle; and Harper, an end. All three are lettermen.

A complete roster of the varsity squad follows:

* *¬´* *

Now let‚Äôs take a look at the future Generals practic-
ing over on the freshman field. Cy Young has the year-
lings in charge again this year, and Jerry Holstein, 1932,
former Washington and Lee guard, now an attorney here
in Lexington, is assisting him this year. Coach Young has
some very good material with which to work, and in their
first two games the Brigadiers defeated Staunton Military
Academy thirteen to nothing and the University of Rich-
mond freshmen thirty-two to nothing.

Rhythm in motion is Richard Pinck, the freshman
quarterback from Paterson, N. J. Always a ground gainer,
Pinck got off on two long touchdown jaunts against the
Richmond freshmen of seventy and eighty-six yards each.
The freshman first string backfield consisting of Pinck,
quarterback ; Al Bishop, Louisville, Ky., halfback ; Court-
ney Wadlington, Shelbyville, Ky., halfback; and Bob
Blanding, Roanoke, Va., fullback, has enough speed and
power to give even the varsity line plenty of trouble. Dan
Justice, Glass High product, Lynchburg, Va., quarter-
back, and Ira Brock, Owensboro, Ky., are also real var-
sity material. With the work of Howard Dobbins of
Louisville, Ky., and Steve Hanasik, Yonkers, N. Y., par-
ticularly outstanding in the line, the freshmen will also
send up some fine men for the varsity forewall next year,
which will be rather hard hit by graduations this year.

On October 22 the freshmen meet Virginia‚Äôs fresh-
man team at Charlottesville in what will probably be the
outstanding game of the week, bar none. Washington and
Lee men will have an opportunity to see what they will
have to play against in future years as the result of Vir-
ginia‚Äôs new athletic program. Virginia withdrew from the
Southern Conference last year and has started on an in-
creased subsidation program which they hope will im-
prove their athletic teams. The Wahoos, it would seem,
are getting tired of being beaten every year by Washing-
ton and Lee.

A complete roster of the freshman squad follows:

Chats With Your Friends and Mine

managing editor of this rag is after me to get my copy to

By the way, in passing, we are glad to welcome Dick

The great question now is what and whom to write
about. A good columnist carries a notebook and puts
down names and items for his column.
This I have intended to do, but for some
reason or other have never gotten around
to it. Consequently I am in a storm. I
have seen so many alumni since last June,
both in my travels and those who have
stopped by our office, that I am afraid if
I start I will overlook somebody. If I do,
[ am sure they will understand.

As I dictate | am wondering what I
will say next, so there is no telling how
readable this will be when I am through.

In reading the column of one of our
neighboring sports editors yesterday he
was in the same kind of a brain storm and
finally ended up by filling his column with letters he had
received. I am tempted to do the same thing, but any let-
ters that come to this office that would be of interest to the
alumni are used in the Class Notes.

x * ok

I spent the past summer, as usual, in one of Uncle
Henry Ford‚Äôs limousines, going from town to town over
the same territory. | was late getting started and am sorry
I did not have time to see more of our friends. I got a lit-
tle off the beaten path when in West Virginia and made
the Norfolk and Western coal fields. It was familiar
ground but changed considerably since my college days,
when I played baseball in practically every town up and
down Tug River.

At Welch, Scram Sale took me in hand, and had he
not I am sure I would have spent several weeks there. |
always thought that Charleston was the home of one-way
streets, but it ranks second to Welch. Scram is a success-
ful attorney in this coal field metropolis, as is Zeb Hern-
don, Beno Howard and ever-enthusiastic Graham Sale.

Just before I entered town I nearly ran over Frank
Beckwith, who was walking in the middle of the road.

 

‚Äòrank is living and practicing law in Charles ‚ÄòTown, West
Virginia, but happened to be in Welch visiting his father.

After a nice visit with my friends in the coal fields my
winding way (and I mean winding way, twenty-five
curves to the mile) brought me back home in Hunting-
ton. Faces in the same setting‚ÄîEddie Long arguing with
Selden Jones, Pat Asbury and our many other Washing-
ton and Lee golfers, as to ‚Äúhow many strokes will you
give me.

Added to our many other lawyers with offices in the
Kirst National Bank Building is none
other than our good friend Amos Alonzo
Bolen, who made history with us both on
the athletic field and in the class room.
Amos has his name on the door of the
well-known firm of Fitzpatrick, Brown
and Davis. The alumni group of Hunt-
ington is fortunate in having this dis-
tinguished young gentleman in_ their
midst.

As usual a lot of time was spent in the
state of ‚Äúbeautiful women, good liquor,
and fast horses.‚Äô In Shelbyville, Ken-
tucky, I stopped for an hour or so and
talked with our good friend Briggs Law-
son. Briggs is the proprietor of a men‚Äôs haberdashery
store and apparently quite successful. If you should hap-
pen to be passing through Shelbyville you can find Briggs
in the shop any morning. If it happens to be in the after-
noon, go directly to the golf course.

In Louisville I was busier than usual and had very lit-
tle time to see any of our friends. I had a few good foot-
ball players on the string and spent most of my time tell-
ing them why Washington and Lee was the only school
they should consider. We have our usual fine crowd of
Louisville boys in school this year. There are ten or twelve
of them in the freshman class.

I made a hurried trip down to Owensboro and spent
the night while there with our good friend Billy Wilson.
Brothers George and Henry were out of town, but with
Billy‚Äôs help we were successful in getting two mighty fine
boys to enter Washington and Lee.

Back to Louisville and on up the river to Covington
and Cincinnati. Again I had the pleasure of spending the
week-end ‚Äúdown on the farm‚Äù with Walter McDonald.
Roger Bear came out and the three of us engaged in our
first game of badminton. As far as I am concerned, it is

[19]

The cAlumni Magazine, Washin gton and Lee University

 

my last‚Äîstrictly a young man‚Äôs game. My usual route
from Cincinnati is through Indiana and Illinois into that
Missouri metropolis, St. Louis, but I found that I was so
far behind my schedule that I could not make it and had
to write George Atwood and H. H. Larimore and John
Patterson, the men who usually give me so much help
there, to this effect, and that I was headed back to Lex-
ington.

While looking out the window seeking inspiration, |
see the co-captains of our basketball team, Kit Carson and
Bob Spessard. Upon inquiry I find that Kit is passing two
$1 bills to Bob, money he has collected for Washington
and [ee auto tags that Bob is selling. Bob tells me he has
written a good many alumni telling them the many ad-
vantages of having one of these Generals‚Äô tags on their
license plates. If you are the recipient of one of these let-
ters, give the boy a lift. He is deserving, and in return |
am sure he will win a few basketball games for you this
winter.

As usual, on my return after a month‚Äôs absence, many
alumni visitors had been by the office and there was a large
accumulation of mail. I found that I had missed Allen Mc-
Dowell, now a member of the faculty of the Kent School.
Allein Beall passed through with his family on his way to
Washington and New York. He hadn‚Äôt been here in ten
years and enjoyed thoroughly seeing his many friends and
making a tour of the new buildings. Allein has two fine
boys and a charming daughter.

The boys, of course, are entering Washington and Lee
in the distant future, and the daughter will be at either
Hollins or Sweet Briar next fall. I missed Emmett Poin-
dexter, down from New York, visiting friends and rela-
tives in this vicinity. I did have the pleasure of seeing
Bunny Humphries who was here with his wife and son
for a visit. The son will enter Washington and Lee in the
near future. Bunny is still with the Virginia Bridge and
Iron Works in charge of their Atlanta office. Dr. Capito
from Charleston stopped in for a minute. He was anx-
ious to see his classmate, Tommy Farrar, and I turned
this gentleman over to Tommy. I missed Dr. William
Laird from Montgomery, West Virginia, busy in the con-

struction of a large hospital and clinic in his home town. ‚Äî

I had a mighty pleasant hour‚Äôs visit with Doak Davidson,
who is living at Warriormine, West Virginia, where he
is general manager of a large coal operation. Doak gets
back to Lexington often as his wife is a native of this com-
munity, but I don‚Äôt get to see him as often as I would like.

I was sorry to miss Hard Tack Bagley, his wife, son
and daughter. I might mention here that the Bagley tra-
dition is being carried on by Charles Bagley, Jr., who is a
freshman this year. (This is ‚Äò‚Äú‚ÄúBrother‚Äô‚Äô Charlie‚Äôs son, not
‚ÄúHard Tacks.‚Äù )

I was glad that I did not miss Johnny Garrow and his
fine family. The next week Harris Garrow and his family

were here and stopped by the office, but I am sorry I had
made my departure again.

Elsewhere in this issue you will find the picture of
seventy-eight sons of alumni now in college. We are
mighty proud of this fine representation and hope that
many more of you are planning your sons‚Äô educations at
your Alma Mater. There is also a picture of the twenty-
eight sons in the entering class. I knew ahead of time the
names of all of these boys who were coming and had
hoped that most of their fathers would accompany them,
but it turned out that only four of them came, or at least
this was all I had the pleasure of seeing.

‚ÄòThe ones I did see were:

Jim Price, Governor-elect of Virginia. As you know
he is succeeding another Washington and Lee man, the
Honorable George Peery. Bill Lord, who for many years
has been on the faculty of Woodberry Forest School,
Orange, Virginia, and John Herndon, an esteemed mem-
ber of the Haverford College faculty of Haverford,
Pennsylvania. Ike Gassman from Freeport, Illinois, was
down with Ike, Jr., who graduated in 1935, and son,
George, who is a freshman this year.

I hope to have in the mail by the time this reaches you,
the annual Homecoming bulletin which is carrying also a
list of alumni sons now in college as well as the full pro-
gram of Homecoming, which happens to be on Novem-
ber 6, when we are playing our respected rivals from
Charlottesville. From all appearances this will be our
greatest Homecoming as Virginia is stronger than usual
this year, with a new coach, and to those of you who do
not know it, they have changed their policy and are award-
ing scholarships to the amount of $800 to worthy athletes.
These scholarships have been provided by their alumni.

This will also be Homecoming Day for our neighbor-
ing institution, V. M. I. At 11:00 a. m. they are playing
the University of Maryland. You shouldn‚Äôt miss this big
day in Lexington, when you will have an opportunity to
see two football games, to say nothing of your hundreds
of friends. You will note from the program we will serve
sandwiches and coffee in the new Student Union build-
ing. We will prepare for you, so don‚Äôt disappoint us.

A few afternoons ago, in talking to our freshman
football team trying to prepare them for our first game
with Staunton Military Academy (which we won, 13-0),
I had to compete with the continual firing of cannon from
the V. M. I. parade ground. They were starting their two-
day celebration of the inauguration of General Kilbourne,
their new Superintendent. From the number of volleys
fired they must have given a salute to every general in the
army. I thought I was back on the St. Mihiel front. To add
to my brain storm, the cannon are again being fired today
as I write this. General Kilbourne is succeeding our good
friend, General John A. Lejeune.

In reading the Roanoke Times this morning I find the

[20]

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

 

column written by our friend John Temple Graves. It is
devoted mostly to this occasion. Quoting from this distin-
guished columnist :

‚ÄúThat President Francis Pendleton Gaines, of Wash-
ington and Lee, will have a part in today‚Äôs ceremonies at
his neighbor institution is not to be doubted. If he is true
to the great tradition in which he lives and which most
fires his genius and love‚Äîthe tradition of Robert E. Lee
‚Äîhe may want to take General Kilbourne aside some time
today and explain why he never can or will keep military
step with him in public appearances to come. Dr. Gaines
has often told us the story of how General Lee, when he
assumed the presidency of the then Washington College
after the war, had come to dislike military formalities and
wish to be relieved of them in every detail. On occasions
when General Lee would have to appear in public with
the Superintendent of V. M. I., says Dr. Gaines, the lat-
ter would naturally take particular pains to keep in step
with so great a soldier‚Äîand General Lee would take
equally particular pains to get out of step.

‚ÄúThere is no academic center in America quite so
beautiful in this column‚Äôs sight as the one at Lexington
where the mountains besiege the plain and where bravery
of history and charm of architecture suggest that men
may have been made in the image of God after all. It is
an inspiring place to become a soldier or scholar and to be
a gentleman at both.‚Äù

I hope to see you at Homecoming November 6. Your

friends will be here‚Äîwill you?
Library Text Revised

A revised edition of ‚ÄúAn Estimate of Standards for a
College Library,‚Äù by Miss Blanche McCrum, was pub-
lished in September by C. Harold Lauck, superintendent
of the Journalism Laboratory Press, Washington and Lee
University.

The revised edition was done under a grant from the
Carnegie Corporation of New York. It is double the size
of the first edition and was completed by Miss McCrum
after a study of source material on college libraries at
Columbia University.

New features of the revised edition include chapters
on student relations and the library program, and a com-
plete index.

The work was printed at the Journalism Laboratory
Press under the supervision of Mr. Lauck and has been
commended by librarians for its format and typography.

Mr. Lauck acted as managing editor of THR ALUMNI
MAGAZINE last year.

Miss McCrum resigned this summer as Librarian at
Washington and Lee, and now is at Wellesley.

 

Engineering Study Praised

F. P. Hamivron, class of 1897, recently prepared a
well-received study called, ‚ÄúSome Data in Regard to
Foundations in New Orleans and Vicinity.‚Äù Approxi-
mately 600 copies were mailed to Engineering colleges and
societies in the United States and Canada, and brought
forth immediate endorsement. The work has been char-
acterized by authorities as ‚Äúinvaluable,‚Äù monumental,‚Äù
and ‚Äò‚Äú‚Äòmarvelous.‚Äù‚Äô

Mr. Hamilton said he does not know ‚Äúhow I ever
managed‚Äù to prepare the study, ‚Äúunless the training and
inspiration of Washington and Lee had something to do
with it.‚Äù

The author lives now at 408 Walnut Street, New Or-
leans, La.

 

Heads Sigma Chi in Virginia

C. Letcu Rivery, A. B., 1924, and A. M., 1929, has
been named grand pratetor of Sigma Chi for Virginia.
Riley is assistant to the president of Roanoke College at
Salem, Va.

The election promted Riley to the highest rank of the
national social fraternity in Virginia. He has been identi-
fied with Sigma Chi activities for a number of years, hav-
ing been initiated into the order by Zeta Chapter, Wash-
ington and Lee University, in 1920.

Son of the late Dr. Franklin L. Riley, who served un-
til his death in 1929 on the Washington and Lee faculty,
the new grand praetor succeeds Dr. Charles J. Smith,
president of Roanoke College, as head of the fraternity in
Virginia.

14-9.

The young man on the cover of this issue of THE
ALUMNI MAGAZINE is William Mahone Rogers, Jr., of
Petersburg, Virginia, captain of the Washington and Lee
Generals of 1937 and one of the most capable centers in
the Old Dominion. We're sorry about having him appear
as ‚ÄúCaptain-elect‚Äù in the layout on pages 16 and 17 ; but‚Äî
well, this is the secret: we of THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE
borrowed that layout from the 1937 Calyx, and_ the
‚Äò‚Äúcaptain-elect‚Äù just couldn‚Äôt be changed, the engraver said.
We liked the pictures, however, and thought you also
would like them.‚Äîk. P. C.

 

ApriaAn H. Boyp, A. B., 1917, has been named de-

State of Mississippi. Boyd, a native of Covington, Tenn.,
was born January 19, 1896.

Promotion came shortly after Boyd's arrival in lu-
rope; in the Argonne, he was raised to the rank of first
lieutenant. He returned to the United States in July of
1919 and was discharged at Camp Gordon, Atlanta.

Collegian Now Monthly Magazine

The Southern Collegian has been making each year a
better showing, gradually acquiring a more interesting
format, and printing more popular material. Last spring
it took a sudden long stride forward, when the publica-
tion board granted the request of its outgoing and incom-

ing editors and business managers that it be changed from
a quarterly to a monthly publication.

Managing the magazine are Paul Holden (Business
Manager), Phi Gam from Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and
Jay H. Reid (Editor), an S. P. E., whose home is in
Montclair, N. J. Prominent on the editorial staff are
Francis Sugrue, brother of Thomas Sugrue of the Amer-
ican Magazine, who comes to Washington and Lee from
Naugatuck, Connecticut; Louis Schultz, of Highland
Park, Illinois; Karl Milligan, Dansville, New York.

The first issue appeared October 15 in time for distri-
bution during the week-end of the opening set of dances.
Subsequent issues will be scheduled to coincide with sim1-
lar events in the University Calendar. Present plans in-
clude a publication for Homecoming, November 6.

With a cover drawn by C. D. Russell, nationally syndi-
cated comic strip artist, the first issue included more car-
toons and humorous material than have characterized the
magazine in past years.

Subscriptions for the year to those who want the maga-
zine mailed to them, are quoted at $1.75 for the eight is-
sues. Several hundred extra copies will probably be placed
on sale at Homecoming.

 

Takes New Bank Position

Reusen A. Lewis, Jr., class of 1916, joined the Met-
ropolitan Trust Company of Chicago this summer as ex-
ecutive vice-president. He had been second vice-president
of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Com-
pany. '

The New York Times had this to say in a story an-
nouncing the change :

‚ÄúMr. Lewis is widely known in the trust field, inas-
much as prior to engaging in commercial banking he was
deputy manager of the American Bankers Association, in
charge of the trust division. He started his career in news-
paper work and at one time served as chief Washington
correspondent for The New York Journal of Commerce.
Later he was associate editor of the American Bankers
Association Journal and a contributor of articles on fi-
nance to magazines. He is a graduate of Washington and
Lee University of Virginia and later took a special course
in trust work at the Harvard Graduate School of Business
Administration. He has been a vice-president of the Con-
tinental Bank seven years.

‚ÄúThe Metropolitan is an independent trust company
which devotes itself exclusively to the trust business.‚Äù

Don't forget! Washington and Lee‚Äôs Homecoming
day is November 6. The Generals will play Virginia on
Wilson Field that afternoon at 2 o'clock.
