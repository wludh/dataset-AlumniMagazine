President’s Page—On the Uses of Great Men

Preliminary Remarks, Washington-Cincinnati Society
Convocation, April 12, 1935

Almost exactly a year ago today, many of you re-
call, wwe had in this chapel exercises of a different na-
ture. Then we went to the lovely village cemetery and
while a little driving snow blinded our eyes we lowered
into the earth the body of a man who combined many
elements of greatness.

Some of us were thinking then that the supreme
tragedy of death is in this fact, that when a great man
dies, so much goes with him.

His knowledge, for example, dies—save for such
part as he may have transferred to the inadequate modes
of type; and his capacity for knowledge, the disciplined
mind with its patient searchings and keen appraisals
and true interpretations, these die. Progress would be
swifter if the great surgeon could transfer to the young
doctor the discernment that results from long exper-
ience, the skill from great practice; if the statesman
could bequeath to the young politician the noble dream
of life’s autumn past all the summer heats of personal
ambition ; if the scholar could transmit to the student
the zeal for a pursuit of knowledge, a competence upon
the path of that pursuit.

In time the great man’s orderings of material things,
his economic authority, breaks down. His personal im-
pact upon other men passes in a generation or two. His
face remains only a lifeless similitude upon prints or
paintings; the memory of his personality slowly dis-
solves.

But of all great men, whether George Washington
or Harry Campbell, certain things never die, cannot die.

The honest and unselfish work that they have done,
at least in some indestructible central core, is perma-
nent. It is heaven’s high concession to us that even in
the brevity and the triviality of our day, we may work
for eternity. So the poet, contemplating the awful con-
trast between the everlasting immensities and our own
pathetic transiency, could voice the most ambitious of
human prayers: “And the work of our hands, establish
Thou it.”

The character of the great man does not die. It
abides, not as an alabaster image to be jealously guard-
ed as perfection, but as a landmark of victory upon
heights far ahead, heights won through struggle and

[ 3

denial, heights that we may reach
by following such examples.

Most important of all, the loy-
alties, the spiritual enthusiasms, of
great men do not die. They endure,
the most precious possessions of our
race. They have this amazing power
that they can give to even dead ma-
terial things a shining immortality.
Washington, for example, died a
man of great property’ and left a
will of great detail, of large dimen-
sion; but of all his holdings, only one part now serves
the purpose then designated in that will. This is the
money he gave to our institution; his generosity en-
dowed that particular money with timeless utility. The
faith of great men and the sacrifices in behalf of their
faith, these things abide.

 

All educational institutions that are not of the “‘cash-
and-carry” type are built not of brick and stone but of
the contributions made by great men, the work they
did, the characters they left as patterns for life, the
convictions they proposed as guides for life.

Our University is blessed in the number of such
men and in the quality of these men, their eminence
and their directions. Today we honor the first two not-
able benefactions, benefactions of more than money:
the gift from Washington and the gift from his friends,
the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati.

These men and other rare souls chose this school
as the depository of their undying heritage, whether of
money or of service. They acted deliberately, without
haste of hysteria, electing of free will and of best
judgment this institution as the channel through which
they would make effective forever their holiest aspira-
tion for mankind, their ultimate faith in the capacity
of youth to offer worthy response.

It is a high honor that has thus been paid us. But
today and always may we think of it not as a mere
compliment, not as a distinction of which we shall
boast, but as the measure of a responsibility, the defi-
nition of an obligation which we gladly accept.

Two of Washington and Lee’s Oldest Alumni

EET Two of Washington and Lee University’s
oldest and most highly respected alumni, men
who studied under General Robert E. Lee:
George Addison Mahan of Hannibal, Missouri, and
James William Lockett
of St. Louis, Missouri.

Back in the recon-
struction days of 1869
both of these men trav-
eled to Lexington to
further their education
at the school headed by
the man to whom the
nation, reunited, bowed
in respect. From differ-
ent parts of the coun-
try they came as youths

-but now, as two of
the University’s most
beloved alumni, they
live near each other.

James William
Lockett left the old
family plantations down
in his native Georgia
and came to Lexington
shortly after the War
setween the States, ar-
riving about the same
time that George Addi-
son Mahan treked to
the historic Virginia
town from his home in
far-away Missouri.

For Mr. Lockett
particularly the fame
that surrounded General Lee lived on in his academic
life. That was because this Georgian had just served
through the war as a member of the fighting Georgia
Cadets, and had become personally familiar with the
reputation of leadership and high character which Rob-
ert E. Lee seemed to enjoy throughout the entire South,
and later extended to the nation through his wise guid-
ance of the institution to which he devoted the last and
richest years of his life.

James William Lockett was at Lexington two years,

eo

 

James William Lockett

leaving in 1869. Now he is in St. Louis, far from his
native Georgia plantations, but still close to Wash-
ington and [ee in his memories.

And in nearby Hannibal, Missouri, lives George Ad-
dison Mahan — let’s
write about his life in
“backward fashion,”
starting with today and
working back to his
student days under
Lee:

Hannibal, Mo., as
you should know if you
haven’t forgotten all
your childhood books
and fantasies, was the
boyhood home oft
America’s Mark Twain,
who glorified the youth
of the nation in a man-
ner yet unexcelled.

Mark Twain so
caught the fancy of
(George Addison Mahan
that he has become pos-
sibly the author’s great-
est admirer. If that
statement seems a bit
broatl, take a trip to
Hannibal and see what
you see:

At the foot of Car-
diff Hill there you will
see a monument of Tom
Sawyer and Huckle-
berry Finn, those hap-
py kids who romped through Mark Twain's pages:

Mr. Mahan erected that monument.

Mark Twain’s boyhood home still stands in Han-
nibal, the property of the city as a memorial to the
writer's genius.

Mr. Mahan with Mrs. Mahan and their son pur-
chased the place and presented it to Hannibal.

To complete the Mark Twain theme, Mr. Mahan
has erected several markers throughout the city denot-
ing various incidents in the author’s life, and point-

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

 

ing out places of interest in connection with his books.

And recently he was made chairman of the state of
Missouri’s Mark Twain centennial celebration, which
officially opened January 15 of this year. The centen-
nial pageant will be staged on June 18, 19, and 20, and
a “gigantic homecoming” (Mr. Mahan’s own stationery
says so!) will be staged the week of September 8. The
Mark Twain birthday banquet is scheduled November
30 to climax the celebration.

Mr. Mahan, besides being head of the law firm of
Mahan, Mahan and
Fuller at Hannibal, is
president of the Mis-
souri State Historical
Society and a member
of the advisory council
of the university of
Missouri. He formerly
was city attorney of
Hannibal, was state's
attorney of the county,
and for a time was a
member of the Mis-
souri state legislature.
He belongs to the Uni-
versity club and the
Noonday club at St.
Louis, is a Mason and
a Phi Beta Kappa.

Now to skip back to
the early life of this
distinguished alumnus:

George Addison
Mahan was born Aug-
ust 6, 1851 in Marion
county, Missouri. He
was a student at Bethel
college, Palmyra and
Missouri before attend-
ing Washington college
the session of 1869-
1870. After leaving
Lexington he went to Indiana University, and received
his LL.B. there in 1872.

Since 1873 Mr. Mahan has practiced law in Han-
nibal, practicing alone until some ten years ago when
he formed the firm he now heads. He finds time to be
a member of the board of directors of the Hannibal
National Bank, the Hannibal Bridge Company, and the
Hannibal Mutual Building and Loan association. He is,
as you would suspect, a member of both the American
and Missouri bar associations,

 

George A.

In 1930 Culver-Stockton college at Canton, Mis-
souri, conferred upon Mr. Mahan an LL.D. degree.

While Mr. Mahan has devoted his life to the prac-
tice of law, Mr. Lockett has directed the family plan-
tations of the South, and engaged in the brokerage and
banking business as well.

James William Lockett was born November 253,
1848, on the Lockett plantation in Crawford county,
Georgia. His family was of Revolutionary stock, and
settled in the state of Georgia about 1780.

Mr. Lockett’s pri-
mary education was re-
ceived in private schools
of Macon, Georgia, not
far from the family es-
tates. He joined the
Georgia Cadets when
the bugles first called,
and served with dis-
tinction during the War
Setween the States, and
following the conflict
managed the _ planta-
tions and became a
broker and banker.

In 1870 he was mar-
ried to Miss Mary Bond
of Macon. His second
wife was Miss Pauline
Ackland of Nashville,
Tennessee.

Mr. Lockett’s fath-
er, William Lockett,
was a famous pioneer
railroad builder of the
old South, and one of
the stories has it that
he constructed the old
Georgia Southern rail-
way from Savannah to
Mahan the Allamaha river with
his own slaves.

Mr. Lockett now makes his home with his daugh-
ter, Mrs. J. Vion Papin, in St. Louis.

There is the all-too-brief story of two of Washing-
ton and Lee University’s oldest and most beloved alum-
ni. There is the story of two men who studied under
General Robert E. Lee, who exemplify the traditions
of the University, who have carried into the nation’s
conglomerate trend of life and affairs the richness of
what they learned at the school which has the traditions
of Washington and Lee as its heritage-—R. P. C.

Sixty Seats in the House of Representatives

By F. JAMEs Barnes, II
Assistant Professor of Political Science at Washington and Lee

NCREASINGLY impressive is the record of Wash-

ington and Lee men in public service being

brought to light by a systematic search of the
records for alumni achievement in this meritorious field
of endeavor.

Twenty-one Washington and Lee governors* of
thirteen states were reported in the first part of the
study to be released. The second release set forth the
exploits of the eighteen United States Senators, from
eleven states, who were wholly or partly trained at
Washington and Lee. And now we add to this splendid
record the achievements of the sixty sons of Washing-
ton and Lee who have represented their states in the
United States House of Representatives, thus advanc-
ing the number of Washington and Lee Congressmen
to the extraordinary total of seventy-eight.

Kighteen states have been represented by these sixty
members of the lower house of Congress; states as
widely separated as Florida and Oregon, Delaware and
California. Virginia has been represented in the House
by twenty-nine Washington and Lee alumni; West Vir-
ginia by six. Arkansas and Kentucky have each chosen
Washington and Lee men on three occasions; Florida,
Georgia, Idaho, South Carolina, and Texas have been
represented by alumni on two occasions. Other states
to be represented by alumni are: Alabama, California,
Delaware, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Carolina,
Ohio, Oregon, and Tennessee.

Riegel Gets Research Award

THE AWARD of a grant-in-aid to O. W. Riegel, di-
rector of journalism at Washington and Lee university,
to permit him to make a study of economic factors in
the gathering and dissemination of news in Europe,
has been made by the Social Science Research Council
of New York.

With the assistance of funds supplied by the coun-
cil, Professor Riegel will leave for Europe in June to
spend three months gathering material in England,
France, Germany and Russia. Professor Riegel is the
author of the recently-published “Mobilizing for
Chaos, The Story of the New Propaganda,” which de-
scribes the political factors in world news.

The study to be undertaken this summer will deal
with economic factors in the operation of news gath-
ering associations and newspapers, including questions
of ownership and control.

Professor Riegel recently was appointed a member
of the Committee on Pressure Groups and Propaganda
of the Social Science Research Council. An article by
Professor Riegel, “Propaganda and the Press,” a study
of publicity and propaganda in American newspapers,
appears in the May number of the Annals of the Amer-
ican Academy of Political and Social Science.

The Sacred Banner of Washington and Lee

By Lestre LyLE CAMPBELL, Class of 1887
Cambridge, Massachusetts

T WAS a soft autumn day in the old town of Lex-

ington. A new generation of students had gath-

ered in the College Chapel to hear read the min-
utes of the faculty adopted sixty-four years before, on
the occasion of the death of their president, General
Robert E. Lee, on October 12, 1870.

In the sacred Chapel sat a student of half a century
ago. His eyes rested upon the banner that hangs on the
wall, over the arch leading to the recumbent statue of
Lee. Rushing memories carried the writer back to the
birth and first bearing of the banner, that he had not
seen for over forty years.

On May 29, 1890, an equestrian statue of General
R. E. Lee was to be unveiled in Richmond, Va. From
the chief marshal, General Fitzhugh Lee, the students
of the College received an invitation to attend the un-
veiling ceremonies. The students chose the writer as
their marshal for the trip to Richmond. A banner was

[ it |

needed to head the student column as they marched in
the procession of the unveiling of the statue, and the
writer secured the assistance of Professor W. G. Brown
in designing a banner that would be appropriate for the
occasion. The banner was paid for largely and loyally
by the students, out of meagre resources, in those
meagre years.

While the banner was being designed and made,
the students gathered on the campus in the afternoons,
in awkward squads, to learn how to “fall in,” to “for-
ward march,” and to mix “right by fours” with “left
by fours.” The student drill caused many a merry smile
on the faces of the Virginia Military Institute cadets
as they passed by.

At last the banner arrived, in all its silken glory.

The chief banner bearer was William Edgar Dar-
nall, and his aides, who held the guy cords, were Jesse
J. Vineyard and Howard Lee Jones,

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

On the eve of the trip to Richmond, the students
gathered on the campus, to hear farewell words from
the Hon. J. Randolph Tucker, and from Professor J.
J. White. Both of these had known Lee, both as a gen-
eral and as college president. Other members of the
faculty were on the left of the banner group.

The students, in blue and white caps and “‘blazers,”
with college colors on coats and canes, and the banner
at the front of their column, marched away to the de-
pot about sundown and boarded a special train that
took them down by North River, through Balcony Falls,
and on down the banks of the James.

That night was not made for sleep!

Early next morning the train pulled into Richmond,
and after breakfast the student column formed on the
Capitol grounds, beneath the equestrian sta-
tue of Washington, the generous benefactor
of their college.

The march of the student body up Frank-
lin street was an ovation. Old soldiers cheered
Iee’s youngest boys. Military companies pre-
sented arms as the boys passed. Miss Mary
and Miss Mildred Lee waved to and smiled
upon their college boys. The alumni cheered
along the way. Thomas Nelson Page rushed
out in the midst of the students and tossed his silk hat
high in the air. The students in their caps and colors
captured the smiles of many of the fairest of the South.

At last Lee’s old and young boys stood, with bared
heads, near the statue as the veil was drawn, and the
Great Chieftain was seen on his faithful ‘Traveller.”
"T'was there and then that the banner received its bap-
tism and benediction. Will Darnall and his aides rev-
erently bore the banner back to the College. ‘Today the
sacred banner hangs near him, in whose honor it was
made and borne by loyal youth, forty-five years ago.

Many of the glorious boys of May 29, 1890 have
passed over the river, and now rest under the everlast-
ing trees. Among them are Lee’s grandson “Bob,” the
two banner aides, Vineyard and Jones, and that charm-
ing student, Count Hidei Fukuoka, who, while in Rich-
mond, won the heart of the writer’s mother by his
gentle modesty and dignity.

Lee’s grandson, Bolling Lee, who marched with the
banner, still survives. The students that still remain will
ever cherish the benediction that fell upon them at Lee's
statue in Richmond.

The arms painted on the banner comprise portions
of the arms of Washington and Lee, which are as
follows :

THe WaAsHINGTON ARMs: George Washington was
descended from the Washingtons of Sulgrave Manor,
England. ‘he coat of arms that he used was derived

|

 

from that ancestral family. In heraldic terms, the Wash-
ington arms are as follows:

Crest: Out of a ducal coronet or (gold) am eagle
issuant (rising), with wings addorsed (back-to-back ),
sable (black).

SHIELD: Argent (silver field), two bars gules (red),
in chief (at the top) three mullets (five-pointed rowels
of spurs, pierced) gules (red).

Morro: Exitus acta probat.

In one copy of the arms used by Washington, the
crest has a raven, while in the arms of his bookplate,
the crest has an eagle. ‘The question as to whether the
American flag had its origin in the Washington arms
is a mooted one. At any rate the three mullets in the
Washington arms are not stars, but are pierced rowels
of spurs, nor are they blue, but blood-red.

THe Lee Arms: The Lee family of Vir-
ginia is descended from one of the most an-
cient families in the English peerage. In 1385
Robert de la Lee, of Coton Hall, Salop Coun-
ty, England, married the daughter and he -r-
ess of Sir Thomas Astley, of Nordley. After
this marriage, the arms of the Lee and the
Astley families were combined and quartered.
At the quartering of the arms, the original
lee arms were placed in quadrants one and four of the
shield, and the Astley arms in quadrants two and three.
In the new combined arms, the Lee crest and motto
were retained.

In heraldic terms, the Lee arms are as follows:

Crest: On a staff raguly (tree branch lopped), a
squirrel sejant (sitting) cracking a nut or (gold), from
the dexter end of the staff an oak branch vert (green),
fructed (fruited), all proper (natural).

SuHiELD: In first and fourth quadrants, the original
lee arms: gules (a red field), a fess (a band) chequy
(checked) or (gold) and azure (blue), between billets
(rectangles) argent (silver), four in chief (at the
top), and three, two, one billets in the base. In quad-
rants two and three are the Astley arms: azure (blue
field), a cinquefoil (conventional five-leaf flower), er-
mine within a bordure (border) argent (silver), en-
grailed (wavy edge).

Morro: In some instances, Ne incautus futuri (im-
perative); In others, Non incautus futuri (declara-
tive).

Irom the arms of Washington and of Lee, the arms
on the banner were evolved, with the exception of the
first quadrant of the shield, which quadrant is as fol-
lows:

Azure (blue field), an open book, on white pages
the words, OMNIA AUTEM PROBATE, from the
Latin Vulgate of the New Testament, I. Thess. 5, 21.

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

The open book and the blue field are symbolic of the
blue-blood Scotch, who founded the College on an
open Bible.

In quadrant two of the shield on the banner, are
the Washington arms; while in quadrants three and
four are the Lee arms.

On the banner, no crest was placed over the shield,
nor was any motto placed beneath. Above the shield
are the words WASHINGTON AND LEE, in gold
letters, on a blue scroll, on a white background. Below
the shield is the date 1749, the time of the founding of
the Augusta Academy, from which the College de-
veloped. The banner is made of heavy white silk, with
gold border and tassels.

Such was and is the sacred banner, borne forty-five
years ago by loyal students, in honor of their immortal
president. From the shield on the banner has come the
coat of arms of the University.

The writer, when a child, went with his father and
mother to see General R. E. Lee, at his first retreat
after the war, at “Derwent,” in Powhatan county, Va.
There the boy received from the soldier a benediction,
as a strong, gentle hand rested on a little head.

In early college days, the same boy stood by a simple
grave, in the floor of the basement of the Lee Chapel.
The Great Chieftain had not then been laid to final rest
in the mausoleum. The only flowers about the grave
were immortelles, from the hills he loved. Today, across
the years, comes a gentle perfume from those im-
mortelles.

In 1883, the same boy was an honored student mar-
shal at the unveiling of the recumbent statue of Lee, in
the College Chapel.

In 1890, his hand and heart again paid humble tri-
bute to the Great General in Richmond. And now, aiter
nearly three score years and ten, the head of a long-
ago boy is warmed by

“The touch of a vanquished hand.”

And in reverence, that boy lays a renewal of his

devotion
“On the doubly sacred shield
Of Washington and Lee.”

NOTE: The official coat of arms of Washington
and Lee University, as used in the University catalogue
and on all official publications, has been made available
to alumni through the Lee Museum at Lee Chapel. The
coat of arms varies slightly from the cut reproduced on
the second page of the above article in that there are
five cinquefoils. Cost of the arms, framed and done in
colors, is $2.00 postpaid to alumni .Order from the
Lee Museum, Lexington, Virginia, and please mention

An Architectural Monument

WASHINGTON AND L&E UNIveErsiTy’s colonnade
and the flanking professors’ residences are among the
three outstanding national monuments of the early fed-
eral architectural period in America, Philip Small, na-
tionally known architect, believes. He puts two other
Virginia institutions in this select group—the College
of William and Mary and the University of Virginia.

Mr. Small, who divides his time between Cleveland
and California, visited Lexington several weeks ago to
study the Washington and Lee campus and surround-
ing buildings. He is consulting architect for a critical
review and approval of the plans of Carneal, Johnston
and Wright, Richmond, Va., firm, for the new law
school building at Washington and Lee.

Asked for an opinion on the correctness of the tra-
ditional design of Washington and Lee’s colonnade,
Mr. Small said that ‘correctness and the precise fol-
lowing of classic formulae are not matters of import-
ance because there are in the architectural richness of
the original buildings at Washington and Lee both vi-
tality and charm that put them above a critical appraisal
of their accurately following classic forms and details.”

He approved in general the present plans for the
new law school home that will replace Tucker Hall,
but took back to Cleveland with him complete sketches
of the campus as it will appear with the new structure
at the northern end of Washington college.

Mr. Small, a graduate of Boston Tech and an in-
structor in the Fine Arts School at Bellevue, France,
after the war, was consulting architect for the Termi-
nal Tower in Cleveland. He directed the general re-
modeling of the Greenbriar hotel at White Sulphur
Springs; designed the Cleveland Playhouse; and is
consulting architect in charge of plans for the John
Carroll university in Cleveland.

 

VLADIMIR Romo, first correspondent from the U.
S. S. R. to be stationed in Washington, spoke to Wash-
ington and Lee journalism students April 5. His topic
was “The Press in the U. S. S. R.” /zvestia, leading
newspaper of Moscow, assigned Romm to cover the
American capital shortly after Ambassador Troyanov-
sky took up his official duties in this country.

Before coming to the United States last year Romm
was correspondent for Tass news agency in Geneva
and Paris, and prior to that time had been with the
same agency in ‘Tokio. The appearance of the Rus-
sian newspaperman at Washington and Lee was spon-
sored jointly by the department of journalism and Sig-
ma Delta Chi, national journalistic fraternity.

Three Hundred Alumni As Teachers

& WASHINGTON AND L£E’s eight thousand living
alumni three hundred are engaged in teaching.
It is a matter of interest and pride to realize
that so many of our men are exemplifying the spirit

and traditions of their
alma mater in so many
class-rooms and on such
widely scattered cam-
puses. These fellow al-
umni play a prominent
part in stimulating the
minds and directing the
ambitions of thousands
of young men and wo-
men from grammar
schools to graduate
schools. In molding the
character and_ shaping
the ideals of youth
Washington and Lee men
have conspicuous oppor-
tunity and responsibility.

Approximately one-
half of our pedagogical
alumni are engaged in
college teaching at home
and abroad. Their names
are listed in this article
and in a later issue ol
The Alumni Magazine
anotlfer list will appear
containing the names of
teachers which are no:
included here. Informa-
tion as to additions and

corrections are welcome.

By R. N. LATTURE
Associate Professor of Political Science and Sociology at W. & L.

 

William Spencer Currell

Of the total: number of our professorial alumni
twenty-one are teaching in the field of English, nine-
teen in foreign languages, sixteen in history, twelve in
chemistry, eleven in medicine, eight in law, seven in

education, and six in
mathematics, political
science, and engineering.
Several other subjects
have claimed the interest
of smaller numbers of
alumni.

The class of 1924
should be awarded the
badge of distinction for
its rich contribution to
the ranks of the teach-
ing profession. Ten men
who were awarded de-
grees at Washington and
lee in June, 1924, are
now engaged in college
teaching. J. P. Brawner
is at Illinois; W. A. Flick
at Washington and Lee;
|... H. Harris at Omaha;
I}. H. Howard at Wash-
ington and Lee; J. V.
logan at Princeton; 5S.
A. McCorkle at Texas:
M. L. Peacock at V. P.
I.: W. LL. Simmons at
Ohio Wesleyan; J. N.
Thomas at Hollins; and

J. H. Williams at Wash-

ington and Lee.

The place of honor

The list given below contains the names of 145 in this list is accorded to that inspiring teacher and

alumni. Thirty-eight of these men are teaching in Vir-
ginia colleges, twenty-two of them being at Washing-
ton and Lee. Eight of our alumni are teaching in the
colleges of Texas, and eight in the state of Illinois. Five
of those in Illinois are on the faculty of the University
at Urbana. Six names on the list are connected with
colleges in each of the states of Maryland, North Car-
olina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

cultured gentleman, William Spencer Currell of the
class of 1878. To him goes the distinction and honor
of having adorned the teaching profession longer than
any other Washington and Lee alumnus now living. He
was a student at Washington and Lee from 1875 to
1882, and a member of the Phi Gamma Delta frater-
nity. He has the further distinction of being the first

to hold the Howard Houston Fellowship and of being

|

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

 

the first editor of The Southern Collegian in magazine
form. In 1879 he received the M.A. degree and in
1882 he was awarded the Ph. D.

Dr. Currell was professor of English at Hampden-
Sidney College for four years and occupied the chair
of English at Davidson from 1886 to 1895. He was
then recalled to the faculty of Washington and Lee,
where he was made professor of English and modern
languages in 1900.

Somewhere in the course of his academic perigri-
nations he acquired the onomatopoetic nickname of
‘‘Jingles.”” We do not know the special occasion which
called forth this nickname but all men who have been
fortunate enough to sit in his classes will attest to the
appropriateness of the appellation.

In 1914, after nineteen years of service on the fac-
ulty of his alma mater, Dr. Currell accepted the pres-
idency of the University of South Carolina, his native
state. In 1922 he retired from the presidency to become
dean of the graduate school. Since 1929 he has devoted
himself entirely to his first and truest love, the teaching
of English language and literature.

Bill Ackerly

Law and Order Chairman

sinL ACKERLY, 1912, recently appointed chairman
of the first Law and Order Committee of the Ameri-
can J.egion, department of Virginia, is the author and
originator of the department’s two-point law and order
program. He summarizes these points as follows:

(1) To encourage and promote, in the minds of all
citizens, a greater respect for and obedience to law and
constituted authority, and a fuller sense of individual
responsibility for the maintenance of law and order,
and the efficient, fair and impartial administration of
justice.

(2) To have Legion posts and legionnaires organ-
ized, prepared and ready to actively aid and assist the
duly constituted law enforcement authorities in emer-
gencies and situations of grave public danger, espec-
ally those involving crimes of violence, when called
upon so to do by such authorities.

“IT confidently believe,’ Ackerly says, ‘this program
is filled with much good for the community, state and
nation. It does not contemplate the establishment of
any vigilante organization, nor any superseding of the
duly constituted law enforcement authorities, nor any
usurpation of the duties and powers of those authori-
ties, but simply rendering to those authorities intelli-
gent moral support at all times and like practical aid
and assistance, when needed and asked for, in emer-

gencies and situations of grave danger to the peace and
good order of society. I sincerely hope the idea will re-
ceive the whole-hearted endorsement and support of all
good citizens and will ultimately be adopted by every
department of the American Legion in the United
States.”

sill is practicing law at Lexington, and has been
commonwealth’s attorney for Rockbridge county since

1928.

 

“President Pro Tem”

Taytor H. StuKkes, who has been serving contin-
uously in the South Carolina state senate, has been
elected president pro tem of the body, according to in-
formation received in the alumni office. After complet-
ing his undergraduate work at Washington and [ee in
1915, he went to George Washington University for his
Ll. B. degree, and since that time has been conspic-
uous as an attorney. He is 41 years old, and was a
first lieutenant in the air service during the war.

Win in Charleston Election

WHEN IT COMES to politics, Washington and Lee
alumni in Virginia have no monopoly, although the cap-
itol down at Richmond is literally filled with former
students of the University.

At Charleston, W.
on April 16 and nam-
ed two Washington
and Lee men to high

Va., voters went to the polls

offices, one as mayor
of the city.

Judge D. Boone
Dawson, running as
an Independent Re-
publican, was swept
into office as mayor of
Charleston with a
majority of 1,886
votes. He received his
LL.B. degree at
Washington and Lee
in 1921.

At the same time,
Cyrus W. Hall, LL.B.

1928, was elected po-

 

lice judge by a sub-
stantial majority.

Come Back to Finals—June 5, 6 and 7!

OTHING that could be written would substitute
for the phrase that forms the title to this article.
But there are a few things you might know
about Finals of 1935 that probably will awaken that old
desire to visit the alma mater and see for yourself how
green the old campus looks, how beautiful the trees
are about Lee Chapel, how Doremus gymnasium will
gleam when decorated
for the dances
Here, for instance, are
a few things you can
look forward to in addi-
tion to the sheer pleas-
ure of coming back to
Washington and Lee:
With Hal Kemp
signed for the first two
nights, and Glen Gray
playing for the last night,
the 1935 edition of F1-
nals promises to offer
the set that
Washington and Lee has

best dance
had in years. Added to
this, there will be a na-
tional broadcast the first
night, Wednesday eve-
ning, June 5, from Dor-
emus gymnasium when
Hal Kemp will play over
a regular commercial
program. Washington
and Lee will go on the
air over the Columbia
network from 8 to 8:30
under this plan. At the present time, some 400 students
have subscribed to the dance set, and Lewis Martin,
president of Finals, expects more to sign up by June.

The dances will begin with the Inter-Fraternity-
Sigma Ball on Wednesday night, June 5; the Pi Alpha
Nu-White Friar dansant will be held Thursday after-
noon, and the Senior-Alumni Ball will take place
Thursday night.

Final Ball, featuring Glen Gray and his Casa Loma
orchestra, will be held Friday night and will last until
6 o'clock Saturday morning.

——

 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

The baccalaureate sermon will be delivered by the
Reverend William C. Hill, of the East Presbyterian
church of Richmond, on Sunday, June 2, in Lee Chapel.
Dr. Robert M. Lester, secretary of the Carnegie Cor-
poration, will speak at commencement on Friday morn-
ing, June 7, and William Roger Sphar, of Winchester,
Kentucky, will make the valedictory address.

The president’s reception to graduates, trustees,
visiting alumni, and parents will be held Thursday
night at 9 o'clock in the president’s home.
} The alumni luncheon will take place at one
» o'clock Friday in the University dining hall,
and there will be a meeting of the Alumni
. Association in Lee chapel at 2 o'clock the
Ks same day. The annual crew boat races
will be held Friday afternoon at 4
when the local sailors will brave
the waves of North River.
The officers and their gals
who will lead the Final ball
include : Martin,
president, with Miss
Doris Martin; George

lewis

J. McGeory, vice-pres-
ident, with Miss Thel-
M.
vice-president,
with Miss Roberta Co-
ver; James E.

ma Walsh; John
Dean,

srown,
publicity director of Fi-

nals, with Miss Peggy
Ann MacIndoe; Joseph
8. Magee, secretary,
with Miss Sue John-
William L. Wil-

son, business manager, with Miss Betty Muller.

son:

 

With this change in dates—a three-day program 1n-
stead of the inconvenient old five-day program—you
can't afford to miss Finals of 1935. The change has
been made largely to eliminate the long, unnecessarily
dull week-end, and so make it possible for alumni to
attend with a minimum of time spent away from bus-
iIness.

Remember again the dates—June 5, 6, and 7. Final
ball Friday evening, June 7, will of course last all night
as in the past.

The Odyssey of Sports, 1934-1935

By Ricuarp PowEL_L CARTER

ET'S TAKE a look back as best we can at what

has happened in the realm of sports at Wash-

ington and Lee University since the first smack
of toe against pigskin last fall:

‘Tex Tilson’s football team, just by way of refresh-
ing your memory, won both the Southern conference
and Virginia championships.

Dick Dunaj, captain of cross country, last fall set
a new Virginia record of twenty-eight minutes, forty-
six seconds over the five and a tenth mile course here.

Forrest Fletcher, director of physi- e.
cal education, was re-elected president |
of the Southern conference at the Rich-
mond meeting in December.

Cy Young’s basketball team whiz-
zed into the finals of the Southern con-
ference tournament down at Raleigh,
losing to the sharp shooting cagers from
the University of North Carolina.

The Washington and Lee swimmers,
under the tutelage of Cy Twombly,
brought home the Southern conference
title from one of the fastest meets in
the history of the circuit, held at Duke
University.

The wrestlers, after a spectacular
season that included no defeats, lost the
championship to Virginia Military Institute on a suc-
cession of tough breaks in the tournament in Doremus
gymnasium.

Hugo Bonino, captain of the mat team, went to the
finals in the national intercollegiate tourney at Lehigh.

And to top it all, the Washington and Lee athletic
council took things in hand after a disastrous season
for the Generals in the ring, and abolished boxing as
an intercollegiate sport at the University.

Before taking a look at spring sports, just beginning
to come into their own as the Alumni Magazine goes to
press, let’s reprint what the athletic council officially
stated following their abolition of boxing :

“While we feel that boxing classes, where a boy 1s
taught the principles of self defense, are desirable, we
believe that intercollegiate boxing is an athletic activity
in which one of the chief objectives is, in effect, to
incapacitate one’s opponent. We consider this inconsist-

 

ent with the aims of an educational institution. There-
fore the athletic council has voted to abolish intercol-
legiate boxing at Washington and Lee University.”

That ends the story of boxing for the Blue and
White, but here are a few facts you may have for-
gotten :

Boxing as an intercollegiate sport was inaugurated
at Washington and Lee in 1919, according to available
records. Several years ago it was boosted into the ma-
jor sport class at the University. Washington and Lee
teams have met with fair success in the
past few years, and this season did not
win a single meet, although two were
| lost by one-point margins.

That, in brief, is what happened in
the realm of sports at Washington and
lee since the football team hied itself
away to Nimrod Hall last fall.

Now

spr rts:

—a

for something about spring

Because of the deadline on magazine
copy (and deadlines are deadlines no
matter what people say) it is almost im-
possible to present any coherent picture
of what is happening to Dick Smith’s
baseball team; to Ollinger Crenshaw’s
tennis team; to Forrest Fletcher's track
men; or to Cy Twombly’s Southern conference cham-
pionship golfers.

As this is written, the Generals have won six, lost
two and tied one ball game. That includes victories over
Maryland, 9-3, and a double header triumph over Vir-
ginia Tech. Dartmouth brought a strong squad down
from the north and handed the Blue and White a 4-0
drubbing, and William and Mary’s Indians eked out
a 2-1 victory in the second game of the season for
the diamond crew.

The weather failed to keep its tryst with Washing-
ton and Lee spring sports teams, with the result that
cold winds sweeping down off old House Mountain
made playing about on Wilson field well-nigh impos-
sible. But the teams have managed to overcome that,
and things point to a better than fair spring.

And Here Is a Swimming Record

WIMMING is not such a spectacular sport, and

for that reason one of the most unusual ath-

letic records in
the south has been over-
looked. It’s this way:

Washington and Lee
tankmen, who _ brought
back the Southern con-
ference championship
from Durham this year,
have lost only two dual
meets in the past six
years. “Cy” ‘Twombly,
coach of the Generals,
dug up the statistics here
as he discussed the team’s
success in the conference
meet at Duke university.
In those six years Wash-
ington and Lee swim-
mers have participated in
an average of five meets
each season.

Leading the swim-
mers at Washington and
lee is Captain Duncan
McDavid of Pensacola,
lorida, who has not lost
a dual meet race in four
years at Washington and
lee, and who now holds
the Southern conference
records in the 50 and
220-yard events. This
year he broke his own
mark in the 220, swim-
ming the distance in 2:
29.1. His time in the 50-
yard dash is 25.1.

The only race he has
lost since coming here
was the 440 in the Sou-
thern conference meet
three years ago. He lost
only by a touch after
leading all the way.

 

McDavid, Swimmer Extraordinary

[ 24 |

The experts call McDavid one of the greatest swim-
mers in the South, but he also is captain of Washing-

ington and Lee's golf
team, holders of the con-
ference title.

The Generals have
been foremost contend-
ers in Southern confer-
ence meets since 1921,
but this year is the first
time they have been able
to amass enough points
for the championship.
Washington and Lee men
placed in every event in
this season’s conference
tournament.

The Generals’ relay
team has come out ahead
in every conference tour-
nament except the one
last year, Coach Twom-
bly said. The two times
the team as a whole has
lost in dual competition
included a defeat by
Duke in 1933, and one
by Virginia in 1934,

Charlie Brasher of
Rutherford, N. J., set a
new conference mark in
the 100-yard dash at
Duke, going the distance
in 56. 7. Brasher, a soph-
omore, returns next year.

Six veterans, how-
ever, have competed for
the Generals for the last
time. They are Captain
McDavid ; George Glynn
of New York City; J. M.
Franklin of Verona, N.
J.; Rod Harris, Gunters-
ville, Ala.; Bob McCau-
ley, Hagerstown; T. K.

Local Alumni Association Notes

Pittsburgh

A MEETING of the Pittsburgh Alumni Association
was held at Kaufmann’s, Friday, March 1.

Those present were Maurice J. Arnd, Fred Fox,
Dick Faulkner, William G. Gault, David D. Johnson,
John Koedel, Charles T. Lile, Lee McGraw, Charles
P. Robinson, Sam H. Showell, and J. C. Whetzel.

The luncheon meeting accounted for the somewhat
meager attendance, as Pittsburgh responds more gen-
erously to an evening meeting. Matters pertaining to
the subscription drive for the new law building were
discussed and tentative plans were formulated to con-
tact every alumnus in the Pittsburgh district.

Dick Faulkner was appointed “minister plenipoten-
tiary” to Lexington to gather some information that
might be helpful in the drive for a one hundred per
cent alumni response in Pittsburgh. A similar meeting
will be held in April.

Huntington

WASHINGTON AND LEE alumni of the tri-states
region gathered at the Frederick hotel in Huntington,
W. Va., on Washington’s birthday and heard as a
feature of their meeting an interesting address on the
battle of Point Pleasant by Dr. E. W. MacCorkle,
class of 1874.

Informal discussion followed regarding attendance
of members of the association, and Dr. MacCorkle
suggested that plans be made for a meeting some time
later, at which an invitation would be extended to the
United Daughters of the Confederacy to have them
meet with the Association. The President appointed a
committee to work out such an arrangement with a view
to having the same held on the next birthday of Wash-
ington. On this committee the following were appoint-
ed: Philip Gibson, Joe Fitchett, William T. Lovins,
Emmett MacCorkle and John Slagle.

President Mann discussed the question of new stu-
dents and made reference especially to future as well as
present students attending the University from Ash-
land. He explained some phases of the fraternity life
of students attending the University under athletic
scholarships, so to speak, and it was the sense of the
meeting that students attending the University on ath-
letic scholarships be influenced towards accepting bids

| 25

from different fraternities rather than allowing them
to all become members of the same fraternity. With a
view to making some investigation of the proper meth-
od of procedure to prevent one fraternity from secur-
ing all students with athletic prowess, the president was
authorized to appoint a committee to discuss this mat-
ter with the proper authorities. The president was made
chairman of this committee.

The following were present :

Houston Laird, John McVay, T. Selden Jones, G.
D. Mayor, Philip P. Gibson, George Keller, R. Lee
Beuhring, J. Ben Lubin, J. W. Fitchett, all of Hunt-
ington, W. Va.

Dr. E. W. MacCorkle, E. W. MacCorkle, and A.
Wendell Mann, all of Ashland, Ky.

Memphis

It wAs Washington and Lee night in Memphis on
February 23, when the alumni from Memphis and the
Tri-States area gathered at the Hotel Peabody to honor
the birthday of George Washington.

The event was planned for the day after the birth-
day of George Washington in order that those alumni
outside of Memphis would be afforded the opportunity
to join in the gala function which was held that night.

Festivities of the evening were started with a smoker
in the Louis XVI room of the Hotel Peabody. After
this general reunion of the alumni, in which many a
yarn of “when I was a student at Washington and
Lee” was swapped, the party gathered in an adjoining
room for dinner. The school’s colors, pennants of Wash-
ington and Lee and of fraternities were used in the
cleverly decorated room. Flowers carrying out the col-
ors in perfect harmony adorned the tables which were
arranged in the form of a huge “W.”

A. B. Knipmeyer, of the class of 1901, acted in the
role of toastmaster. One of the most interesting parts
of the banquet was the reading of a letter from our
beloved Bishop James R. Winchester, of the class of
1874, by Mr. Knipmeyer, expressing his regrets to the
secretary of the alumni chapter for being unable to at-
tend the banquet due to a recent illness. It carried a
message to the younger generation of Washington and
lee men which made them more fully realize the value
of being an alumnus of the University. Several short

The Alumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

 

but impressive addresses were delivered during the
banquet by such prominent alumni as T. R. Boyle, of
the class of 1876; Dr. Sam Raines, 1921; George Fai-
son, 1915; John S. “Boots” Edmondson; Cooper Tur-
ner, 1927, and John K. Speed, president of the local
alumni group.

Following the banquet the alumni were joined by
their wives and friends for dancing in the Continental
room of the Hotel Peabody. Throughout the evening
the room was filled with strains of Washington and
lee tunes including the immortal “Swing,” “Fight,
Fight, Blue and White,” “College Friendships” and
others.

Those attending included :

President John K. Speed, T. R. Boyle, Dr. Sam
Raines, Peter R. Friedel, secretary; H. J. Patterson
of Osceola, Ark.; William “Bill” Robinson of St.
Louis; F. C. “Crit” Currie; John M. Raines of Little
Rock; A. B. Knipmeyer; Russ Pritchard; C. W. Rabb

Nail; ‘T. Seehorn; Monroe Frank; James Durham.

Atlanta

ATLANTA alumni met for an informal dinner at
the Atlanta Athletic Club, Friday evening, April 5.

The following alumni were present: Dr. M. Ashby
Jones, J. Sam Slicer, Alex M. Hitz, Francis Fuller, T.
Hal Clark, Edmond Magers, Bill Stone, Dr. K. C.

Carrolton, Ga.

Dr. Ashby Jones made the address of welcome to
Dr. Gaines, expressing the confidence and love of the
alumni for Dr. Gaines as a worthy successor of the
illustrious presidents of Washington and Lee.

Dr. Gaines talked informally, and as he expressed
it, giving the group the “gossip and news of Washing-
ton and Lee,” as well as telling of interesting features
regarding the history and endowment.

After Dr. Gaines’ address, the meeting continued
with a general round table discussion and reminiscences
in which practically every alumnus participated.

At the close of the meeting, Ewing S. Humphreys
was elected temporary president and Willis Everett
temporary secretary, to make plans for an annual
alumni dinner, and in fact a more active organization
of the Atlanta alumni.

Cincinnati

On Apri 2, the Cincinnati Alumni association met
for a luncheon at the Metropole hotel. Many phases of
alumni activity were thoroughly discussed, including
the subscription campaign for the erection of the new
law school. The association voted its wholehearted
support to the movement.

The group also decided to offer a joint gathering
with the University of Virginia alumni to take place
at a designated camp somewhere along the river.

The following members were present: Roger Bear,
1914; Walter McDonald, 1910; Walton H. Bachrach,
1926; Clyde Hoge, 1908; Judge Horace J. McFarlan,

the Metropole on the first Tuesday of each month.

Washington

WASHINGTON AND LEE alumni in the city of Wash-
ington have begun holding monthly luncheons, and
judging from attendance at the first two, the plan seems
to be meeting with deserved success.

The luncheons are held at the University Club, and
alumni who visit the nation’s capital are asked to con-
tact either Ed Campbell or Woodson Houghton at the
Southern Building so they can attend the affairs. No
specific dates have been determined upon, but twenty
men were present at the first affair in March, about an
equal number in April, and plans are going forward
for a “bigger and better’’ luncheon in May.

Richmond

WASHINGTON AND LEE alumni of Richmond gath-
ered at the Westmoreland club the evening of April
19 for a dinner meeting and heard talks by both Cy
Young and Dr. Gaines at what was generally consider-
ed “one of the best meetings in some time.” Lieutenant
Governor Price presided.

The Washington and Lee-Duke game to be played
in Richmond October 5 this year was discussed at
length, and a committee was appointed to work with
Dick Smith in arranging one of those traditional “big
days,” only this time plans will be made for one of the
most colorful football events ever staged in the capital
of the Old Dominion.

Those named on the committee were Lewis Powell,

New York

IN THE Most successful organization meeting of
recent years the New York alumni met for their tenth
annual dinner at the Hotel Lexington on Friday eve-
ning, March 8. Sixty members were present to wel-
come Dr. Gaines on his return from his European va-
cation.

In addition to our many distinguished alumni and
Dr. Gaines who, while not an alumnus, is as true a son
of Washington and Lee as any of us, we had as our
guests. J. M. Weems, perennial president of the local
V. M. I. alumni; Charles A. Sweet and H. W. Roberts,
both fathers of honor students now attending Wash-
ington and Lee.

The main topic of discussion was the new law
school, and Dr. Gaines stirred the assembled alumni to
loud and sincere cheers when he closed his informal
talk by saying, “Tucker Hall is no more, but, with the
help of our ever loyal alumni, there will arise from its
ashes a newer and finer structure that will not only fill
our cultural need but will also do justice to the natural
beauty of our campus.”

John W. Davis, 1892, former ambassador to Great
Britain and Democratic presidential candidate in 1924,
then spoke informally about the plans for the New
Tucker Hall and the financial arrangements that would
be necessary for the successful completion of the
project.

Edward W. Lee, 1913, secretary and treasurer of
our local alumni group since its inception, then arose
to astound the alumni with the fact that depression or
no depression the number of active alumni in New York
had risen steadily every year since we were organized.
“We started in 1925 with 56 members and at this mo-
ment we have 111 paid-up members,” he said. Ed con-
cluded with the good news that the books as usual show-
ed a profit for the year.

A further pleasant shock was in store when the
newly appointed dinner committee composed of Nel-
son W. Burris 1926, chairman, Paul L. Bock 1924, and
Stuard A. Wurzburger 1928 announced that it too had
made money and would turn over the surplus for the
building of the new law school.

The annual election of officers was then held and
Clarence L. Sager 1914, our retiring president and
also the evening’s jovial toastmaster, then turned the
meeting over to Hugh R. Hawthorne 1910, our new
president, who introduced the other new officers for
1935:

Vice-president, Emmet W. Poindexter, 1920; sec-
retary-treasurer, Edward W. Lee, 1913; members of
the Council for three years, J. T. Lykes, Nelson W.
Burris, 1926, Clarence L. Sager, 1914.

A cordial invitation is extended to any alumnus
who might be in New York to attend our monthly get-
together luncheons. We'd be delighted to have you
drop in.

The date, first Wednesday of every month; the
place, Planters restaurant ; the time, 12:30.

Lexington, March 8, 1935:

The Odyssey of Sports

(Continued from page 23)

ference title, are well on the way to repeating if they
continue on their so-far triumphant march. In the first
match of the season, played over the hilly ‘Tri-Brook
course at Lexington, T'wombly’s charges defeated the
University of Florida linksmen and walked off with a
12-6 victory. Then the Generals walloped the Univer-
sity of Virginia on the same course, 13% to 4%; and
entertained Hampden-Sydney by blanking them, 18-0.

The golf team this spring is composed of a quartet
of veterans. They are Jimmie Watts of Lynchburg,
Va.; Bill Alexander of Washington, D. C.; Charlie
Cross of Portsmouth, Va.; and Captain Duncan Mc-
David.

The Washington and Lee track team went to V. P.
I. April 13 for the first meet, made a clean sweep of
the broad jump, and came back victors by 67-52.

The Virginia “Big Four” track meet will be held
on Wilson field May 11 this year, after which the cin-
der path artists will go down to Durham for the Sou-
thern conference meet on May 18.

The tennis team, kept off the courts until late in
April by consistent rains, took courage and went to
Lynchburg for the initial meet April 13 without a sin-
gle day of outdoor practice, and lost 7 to 0.

So, briefly, the sporting odyssey of 1934-1935 ends
for the Alumni Magazine. All in all, it has been a great
year. The wrestlers and the basketball team lost their
conference titles, but as this is penned (I should say
typed) the Generals still hold three Southern confer-
ence championships, and it looks as though they will
cling to them.

And if you don’t think it’s a record of some sort
for one school to hold three places of absolute suprem-
acy in the Southern conference, just take the trouble
to look over all available records.

That’s what I’ve been doing for nine months.

Now I need a rest. See you next fall.
