Here is a new Washington and Lee song which the editors believe you will like very much. Larry Watkin, professor of
English at the University, who is well known among alumni for his work in dramatics, wrote the words and the tune, first
arranged by Professor Henry Shelley. The present arrangement for glee club, piano and mixed chorus is by Professor John
Graham. This arrangement was used in a Washington and Lee broadcast from radio station WSM, Nashville, June 26, 1934.

Forty-Two Years on the Tulane Faculty

A Biographical Sketch of Dr. Douctas S. ANpDERSON, Class of 1890

AcK IN 1890 Douglas Smith Anderson received

his Bachelor of Arts degree from Washington
and Lee University, then went down to Tulane to do
graduate work. He liked it there and in 1892 acquired
his Masters degree from
the far-south school and
in October of the same
year was appointed in-
structor in physics in
what Tulane then de-
scribed as the academic
colleges, composed of
the colleges of arts
and sciences and tech-
nology.

Since that appoint-
ment Dr. Anderson has
served continuously on
the Tulane University
faculty, with the excep-
tion of two sessions.
His first absence from

1900,

when he accepted an

Tulane was in
appointment at the Un-
iversity of Mississipp1.
However, he remained
at Mississippi only one
year, returning to the
school of his choice the
following term as asso-
ciate professor of elec-
trical engineering.

Dr. Anderson’s sec-
ond period of absence
trom Tulane’s faculty
came when he went to the University of Berlin and the
Polytechnic School at Zurich to study electricity and
magnetism.

In 1907 Tulane advanced this son of Washington
and [ee and native of Lexington to the rank of pro-
fessor of electrical engineering, and in 1919 appointed
him to the enviable position he now holds, that of
dean of the college of engineering. His advancement
in the field of electricity was steady—in 1893 he had

|

 

we

become assistant professor of physics, and in 1898 as-
sociate professor of physics and electrical engineering.
That in brief has been the career of Dr. Douglas
S. Anderson. ‘Tulane has honored him often and he has
become a tradition at the
university, holding a se-
cure place in the life of
that institution and ex-
erting a steadily increas-
ing influence on the af-
fairs of the school.
Here is what the _
Tulane News Bulletin
has to say about this
Washington and Lee
alumnus :
“Dr.
ceived his first appoint-
ment to the faculty just

Anderson re-

eight years after the old
University of Loutsia-
na had been reorganiz-
renamed the
University of
rr’ .
Phis

ed and
Tulane

[ ouisiana. was
during the administra-
tion of the first presi-
dent of Tulane, Colonel
William Preston John-
ston, and the ‘campus’
of those days consisted
half square of
ground bounded by

of a

Dryades, Common and
Baronne streets, on
which stood just four
buildings, which have long since been demolished and
their places taken by the Roosevelt hotel, the two thea-
tres, and the theatre arcade: These four buildings
housed the academic, medical and law departments, as
they were called at that time.

“He has had the interesting experience of having
served under every Tulane president, Dr. William Pres-
ton Johnston, Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, Dr. Edwin B.
Craighead, Dr. Robert Sharp, and Dr. A. B. Dinwid-

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

 

die. During Dr. Dinwiddie’s illness last year he served
as acting president of the university. In recognition
of this service to the university the board of trustees
adopted unanimously the following resolution :

““RESOLVED: That the board desires to express
to Dr. Douglas Anderson its sincere thanks and ap-
preciation of the valuable and efficient service rendered
by him as acting president of Tulane University dur-
ing the illness of President Dinwiddie. His zeal, abil-
ity and sympathetic co-operation have been of ines-
timable value in solving the many problems of the Uni-
versity, and have won for him the gratitude and hearty
commendation of the board.’

“Dr. Anderson was a graduate student and assist-
ant professor closely associated with the early devel-
opment of instruction in engineering subjects in Tu-
lane. This development came through the interest of
certain professors of physics and chemistry in the
practical applications of the sciences in which they
specialized, and who began voluntarily to offer courses
with the engineering point of view. Notable among
these men were Dr. Brown Ayres and Professor John
M. Ordway.

“Dr. Anderson has also had the interesting exper-
ience of observing and being closely associated with the
growth of athletics at Tulane during all this time.

“Though never himself a very active participant
in athletics, he has been since 1890 a member of prac-
tically every board of control of intercollegiate sports
in the University from that day to the present time.

“He also has taken an active part, as Tulane’s rep-
resentative, in the affairs of the S. I. A. A., the Sou-
thern and the Southeastern conferences respectively.

“During the World War he was director of the
electrical division of Tulane’s war training school for
radio operators and automobile mechanics. He is a fel-
low of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, member of the American Institute of Elec-
trical Engineers, past vice-president and director of
the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Educa-
tion, member and past president of the Louisiana En-
gineering Society, member of Phi Beta Kappa, honor-
ary member of the Tulane chapter of Sigma Phi Delta,
and charter member of Alpha Sigma Epsilon, honor
society of the Tulane College of Engineering. In recog-
nition of his extra-curricular activities he has been
elected to Phi Phi and Omicron Delta Kappa membership.

“In June of 1933 Dean Anderson’s alma mater,
Washington and Lee University, bestowed on him the
honorary degree of Doctor of Science.”

And that is the story of Dean Douglas Smith An-
derson of Tulane University.

Alumnus Decorated in Chile

WiLtL1AM J. TURNER, who received his A. B. degree
from Washington and Lee in 1903, recently was deco-
rated by the government of Chile for meritorious ser-
vice to that country.

The story of his deeds is told in the following dis-
patch from El Mercurio, daily newspaper published in
Santiago :

“Yesterday afternoon the government of Chile |

granted two high decorations: one of them to a dis-
tinguished Uruguayan diplomat; and the other to an
engineer who has resided in Chile for more than 25
years, and who has contributed in many ways to the
well-being of the working class and to the increase of
foreign trade.

“The Chancellor, in consideration of the merits,
so manifest in don Enrique Buero, distinguished Uru-
guayan statesman and diplomat and president of the
Brazilian-Uruguayan Boundary Commission, presented
him with the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit.

“At the same time he decorated with the order “Al
Merito” with the rank of “Comendador” the general
manager of the Braden Copper company, Mr. William
Joel Turner, civil and metallurgical engineer, who has
been employed in Chile for many years. In the course
of his professional work, he has initiated many move-
ments of importance. He has founded schools and by
his own ruling established for the children of the
workmen obligatory primary instruction, many years
before the corresponding Chilean law was enacted.

“Also, he founded in Chile “el Salario Familiar”
and other social regulations which shortly after were
incorporated in the social laws of Chile. He has caused
the Braden Copper company to purchase in the coun-
try all the supplies which could be obtained here for
its diversified technical operations which represents the
distribution in Chile of several million pesos annually,
which formerly went abroad. The company which he
directs has not had a single strike for higher wages
for it has been the constant policy of Mr. Turner to
adjust wages to the cost of living.”

have little trouble helping out Cy Young in basketball
next year. Spessard stands six feet, seven inches tall,

He played center on the freshman quintet this season.

Justice Louis S. Epes, 1882-1935

outs S. Eprs, justice on the Virginia state su-

preme court of appeals since 1929 and a trustee

of Washington and Lee University since that
same year, died unexpectedly of a heart attack in Rich-
mond on February 14.

The University thus lost one of its most interested
and useful trustees, and the state of Virginia one of
its most capable and respected jurists.

Justice Epes, who was 53 years of age, received
his appointment to the state supreme court from Gov-
ernor Harry Flood Byrd in November, 1929, filling a
vacancy created by the death of Justice Jesse I. West.
At that time, he was a member of the state corpora-
tion commission, and his place on that body was filled
by George C. Peery, now governor of the Old Domin-
ion and himself an alumnus of Washington and Lee.

Justice Epes was a member of a family long prom-
inent in southside Virginia, and was the son of the
Rev. Theodore Prior Epes and Mrs. Joane Spence
Epes. He was a native of Prince William county.

He was graduated with the highest honors in his
class at Hampden-Sydney and again at Washington
and Lee, where he took his law degree in 1908, after
an intermission in his school life during which he
taught school for five years.

Taking up the practice of law in Blackstone, Vir-
ginia, Justice Epes specialized in corporation law and
after serving in the army was elected to the state sen-
ate in 1919. In that year he served on the finance, edu-
cation and auditing committees and after being re-
elected to the senate decided to run for the state cor-
poration commission, which at that time was an elec-
tive honor.

After winning election to the commission Justice
Epes took up his work as a member of the body pre-
maturely by filling the unexpired term of Judge Wil-
liam F. Rea.

He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa.

Numerous state dignitaries paid high tribute to
this alumnus, some of which follow:

Governor Peery: “I am shocked and deeply grieved
at the sudden death of Justice Louis S. Epes. As a
member of the Virginia Senate he took high rank. His
industry, independence and high idealism won for him
great respect and many friends. His service as a mem-

fig

ber of the state corporation commission was equally
distinguished. It was a fitting climax to his splendid
career that he should serve the state as a member of
its highest court.

“His legal ability, untiring industry and fine judg-
ment won him high place among Virginia's great
judges. His death in the prime of life is a great loss
to the state. I feel a distinct loss. He was my friend.
| shall greatly miss him.”

Justice Edward W. Hudgins: “He was a profound
student of law and a keen observer of the trend of cur-
rent thought. He was well versed in Virginia’s past
and zealous in maintaining her best traditions. He ren-
dered her conscientious and able service as a legislator,
as an administrator on the corporation commission and
as judge.

“His associates on the bench will sadly miss his
wise counsel and the result of his careful investigation
of the history of legal principles.

“Virginia has lost an able jurist and I a warm per-
sonal friend.”

Chief Justice Preston W. Campbell: “Judge Epes
came to the bench magnificently equipped for the work.
He had youth, experience, ability and ambition. His
was a rare devotion to the public service and he gave
himself wholly and unstintedly to his duties as a mem-
ber of the court. His associates bore him a deep and an
abiding affection.

“An outstanding Virginian has passed in the prime
of life and the court has lost one of its ablest members.
My deepest sympathy goes out to his loved ones.”

United States Senator Harry F. Byrd: “Virginia
never had a more patriotic, earnest and conscientious
official than Justice Epes. From the day he was elect-
ed to the senate twenty years ago he has.dedicated him-
self unreservedly to the highest type of public service.
He has been my close associate and intimate friend.
No one realizes more than I do the loss Virginia has
suffered. I have never known a more loyal friend or
man with higher ideals.” .

Dr. Robert H. Tucker, dean of Washington and
Lee University: “Judge Epes’ death has brought a
feeling of shock and distress to this community. He
was a distinguished graduate of Washington and Lee,

Eighteen Washington and Lee Senators

By F. James Barnes, II
Assistant Professor of Political Science at Washington and Lee

TOTAL OF one hundred and sixty-five Senate

years has been amassed by Washington and Lee

alumni who have served their states in the im-
portant capacity of United States Senator. Sons of
Washington and Lee have gone to Capitol Hill from
eleven states. Three have represented Kentucky, three
Mississippi. Two each have gone from Florida, Louis-
iana, and Virginia; and one

Frankfort, Kentucky ; member of Virginia Senate from
the District of Kentucky 1784-1788; member from the
Kentucky district of Virginia to the Continental Con-
gress in 1787 and 1788; elected from Virginia to the
First and Second Congresses, and served from March
4, 1789 to June 1, 1792, when that part of Virginia
which is now Kentucky was admitted as a state into the

union; elected on June 18,

 

each from North Carolina,
South Carolina, Tennessee,
Oklahoma, Oregon, and
Washington.

The Alumni Magazine presents the second
of a series of articles by F. James Barnes, II
on Washington and Lee men who have be-

1792 to the United States Sen-
ate from Kentucky for the
term ending March 3, 1793;
re-elected on December 11,

First Washington and Lee
Senator was John Brown,
chosen to represent Kentucky
in June, 1792. Present defend-

senatorial tradition is ‘Tenn-
essee’s Nathan [,. Bachman,
appointed to the Senate on
February 28, 1933, to fill the

come famous in public life. The author has
spent more than a year preparing these ar-
ticles, the first of which appeared in the
last issue of the Alumni Magazine, and
dealt with sons of the University who be-
came governors. Every effort has been made
here to include all Washington and Lee men
who have been to the United States Senate,
but Mr. Barnes will welcome letters con-
cerning any who may have been omitted, or
will be glad to have additional information
on the men listed. The third article of this
series will appear in the next issue, and will
describe Washington and Lee alumni who
have been or still are members of the House

1792 and again in 1799, and
served from June 18, 1792, to
March 3, 1805; elected presi-
dent pro tempore of the Sen-
ate on October 17, 1803, and
January 23, 1804; member of
the local board of war for the
district of Kentucky in 1791;
resumed the practice of law;
died in Frankfort, Ky., August
29, 1837, being the last survi-

A Note From Far Away

“IT left Washington, where I had been chief of the
visa division, Department of State, for several years,
and proceeded with Ambassador Bullit from New York
on February 15, 1934, for Moscow, U. S. S. R., with
orders to stop en route at Berlin and Riga and remain
at the latter place, Riga, Latvia, until ordered to pro-
ceed to Moscow at such time as the consulate general
at Moscow will be ready to begin the issue of immigra-
tion visas in Russia. Due to lack of space this work
has not been commenced there as yet and I have re-
mained in Riga. In October, after the sudden death of
the American consul at Riga, I was appointed as Amer-
ican consul at Riga—this position I still hold. This ot-
fice does the immigration work for the whole of Russia.

“With pleasure and pride I read of the achieve-
ments of the football team of Washington and Lee.
My congratulations to the team and my confidence in
the spirit of Washington and Lee which has inspired
this team and all other teams who have and who will
represent our Alma Mater.—A. Dana Hodgdon,”

Justice Louis S. Epes, 1882-1935

a loyal alumnus and an interested and useful member
of its board of trustees. The high quality of his work
led in 1919 to his being offered a professorship in the
school of law, a position which he declined in order to
remain in the service of the state.

“Judge Epes leaves a distinguished public career
beginning in 1920 and extending to the time of his
death. He was noted for devotion to his work and for
the keen power of his mind. His death is a great loss
to this institution as well as to the people of the state.”

 

A Diary, 1860-1895

“A Diary with Reminiscences of the War and Ref-
ugee Life in the Shenandoah Valley, 1860-1865” will
be published by Hunter McDonald about February 1.
Mr. McDonald, who attended Washington and Lee in
1878 and 1879, has spent many years working on the
book, which promises to reveal some interesting com-
ments on General R. E. Lee along with rare bits of
history of the War Between the States.

Alumni interested in the diary can address Mr. Mc-
McDonald, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee. The
book. will contain a memoir of General Lee by the
author as one of its interesting features, and will be
concluded with a genealogical sketch of the McDonald
and several related families.

 

State’s Attorney

LAYMAN J. ReEppEN, class of 1927, is one of the
youngest men ever to hold a state's attorney job in
Maryland. He was sworn in recently at the age of
thirty. Democrats in the primary of last September
nominated him for the position, and he was elected in
November by a majority of 1,344 votes, one of the
largest majorities ever received by a candidate for an
elective office in his county. Mr. Redden studied law
at both Washington and Lee and Maryland.

 

Jack BatLey, of Maysville, Kentucky, captain of

Finals, 1935—A Change in Dates

By Jim Brown, 1935

Wie: ANNOUNCEMENT of the change in dates for

Finals this year will be of unusual interest to all
alumni. Instead of the Friday-Saturday and Monday-
Tuesday arrangement of the set, the dances will be
shortened to three days, beginning Wednesday eve-
ning and culminating with the Final Ball Friday night,
the dance lasting until dawn.

The dates have been set for June 5, 6, and 7, and
this will eliminate the yawning void of the Sunday be-
tween dances, which was always a period of inertia
and general let-down. Another advantage of the new
arrangement is that the three-day set will enable a
greater number of alumni to attend who hitherto have
been unwilling to take off five days from their business
or occupation. The Finals set of dances, of course, be-
longs peculiarly to the alumni, and for both sentimen-
tal and social reasons most graduates who can possibly
do so try to attend the Senior Alumni ball.

Lewis W. Martin, of Richmond, is president of
‘Finals this year, and he is already working hard on
preparations and the selection of an orchestra. A stu-
dent poll will be conducted in two weeks containing
the names of five nationally known orchestras from
which the most popular one will be selected. Jan Gar-
ber has played for the last two sets of Finals. Other
officers include: John Dean, of Tribbett, Miss., and
George McGeory, of Yonkers, N. Y., vice-presidents ;
Joe Magee, of Texarkana, Ark., secretary; Billy Wil-
son, of Owensboro, Ky., business manager; and James
I. Brown, of Middletown, Conn., publicity director.

In order to fit in with the new schedule, the grad-
uation exercises will be held Friday morning, June 7.
The speaker for the occasion has not yet been selected.

The executive committee for the dances includes:
Stewart Buxton, Memphis, Tenn.; Thomas Sparks,
Crossett, Ark.; Grier Wallace, Charlotte, N. C.; Les
Helmer, Cumberland, Md.; Edward Chappell, Urbana,
Va.; John Thomas, Charleston, W. Va.; Harry Rhett,
Huntsville, Ala.; Alexander Harwood, Williamsburg,
Va.; Charles Davidson, Lexington, Va.; Robert Mayo,
Washington, D. C.; Don Wallis, Bedford, Indiana;
and Edward Marks, Brownsville, Tenn. Because of
the omission of one night of dancing, it is probable
that the Interfraternity ball will be combined with
the Sigma German on Thursday night. The P. A. N.-
White Friar dansant will be held Thursday afternoon.

For the past three years, this writer has looked
upon Finals as just a marvelous week-end, but this
year we are almost afraid to think of it because it is
our last one. Sitting here, our memory brings back nos-
talgic pictures of other June days and of friends who
have graduated. We recall a warm spring breeze—
swaying trees in full bloom—the tramp of feet along
the walks at noon—‘glad those exams are over”—the
air of celebration-—‘‘she gets in some time this eve-
ning’—and along about twilight she and countless
others sweep into town from all directions in a sym-
phony of gaiety and laughter—that night, fleecy clouds
shade a silvery moon—listening once more to genial
Jan Garber—beneath soft lights—streamers, exotic
gowns, the gleam of white and black—Interfraternity
ball—warm prelude to P. A. N.-White Friar dansant and
Sigma German-—the parade of white in the afternoon
—white shoes, white flannels, white dresses—hboat races,
movies, fraternity horse-play—-the call of the road—to
Goshen Pass, Lover’s Leap, North River—the roar of
cars and the lilt of laughter in the quiet at midnight—
the quiet laziness of Sunday—Baccalaureate—the cam-
pus, shaded green grass, falling blooms, the gleam of
white columns—-couples strolling—Senior Alumni ball
—glad greetings—late and later dates—the senior class
in full parade--the march of cap and gowns to the
Chapel—a warm breeze through the windows—and
suddenly they have diplomas in their hands—dinners,
luncheons, teas—families, friends, fraternities—the
Final Ball-—color, music, gaiety—and then as the sun
begins to streak through the windows, the lump in the
throat feeling—an aching love for Washington and
Lee and all that it means—seniors with tears in their
eyes-—partings—good-byes-—farewells—milestone—and
the last note of “College Friendships” as dawn breaks—

Our college friendships soon must sever,
And fade as does the dying day,

Our closest bonds must all be broken,

As through this world we wend our way.
But yet—-whatever be life’s fortunes,
Though friendships fail and friends be few,
We'll love thee still our Alma Mater,

Our dear old W. and L. U.

This year the grapplers are defending the Southern
conference crown in Doremus gymnasium, March 1

So Coach Mathis’ mat artists rose to new heights

followed a convincing victory over the

After that people began to sit up and take more
notice of Washington and Lee’s tankmen.

Virginia Tech brought a strong team to Lexington
to swim the Generals on February 16, and Coach
Twombly’s men splashed water in their faces all along
the route, getting a fifty-four to thirty-four victory.

In boxing the Generals had bad breaks, but with
Lewis Martin, of Richmond, senior at
Washington and Lee, as assistant
coach actively in charge of the leather
pushers, the team gave a good enough
account of itself even if it didn’t break
into the right side of the ledger.

Martin, technically assistant to Tex
Tilson as coach, turned out a good
squad with the few men he had avail-

Washington and Lee has lost three games by two-

total a good basketball team that hasn’t had the breaks.

In swimming, Coach Cy Twombly’s tankmen have
been more than good—they’ve been excellent. In fact,

Journalism Directory Published

A pirectrory of Washington and Lee men who are
in the the journalistic world has recently come off the
press. Work on the book was completed by Professor
O. W. Riegel, head of the department of journalism.

This is the first attempt to discover how many for-
mer students of Washington and Lee are in journal-
istic occupations. The directory contains sketches of
one hundred men, the majority of whom received de-
grees from Washington and Lee, though some did not
complete their work on degrees and others received hon-
orary degrees.

The directory was designed and printed in the jour-
nalism laboratory by C. Harold Lauck, laboratory in-
structor in journalism. It will be distributed among
publishers, editors, educators and alumni. Copies may
be obtained from Professor Riegel.

 

JoURNALISM students at Washington and Lee went
on two field trips February 22, one group going to
Staunton and one to Roanoke to work for the day on
the staffs of newspapers at those cities. In Staunton a
group accompanied by Richard P. Carter cooperated
in putting out the Evening Leader, and in Roanoke a
group accompanied by O. W. Riegel, acting director
of the Lee School of Journalism, aided the staff of
the World-News in gathering and editing the day's
news.

pe ME EDITOR of this ex-
cellent magazine has

very kindly invited me to tell
his patrons about the board
of trustees’ plan for the new
law building and I wish, as I
have wished before, that he
had a larger audience.

Yet that small number
that reads these pages is a
choice and responsive group
of alumni. I address myself
to you with full appreciation
that your intrest and loyal-
ties and affection for Wash-
ington and Lee are stronger
than others.

The University on Feb-
ruary 11 sent out a bulletin
to all alumni, reporting the
loss of Tucker Hall by fire
on December 16, explaining
temporary measures for con-
tinuing courses and promis-
ing, so strong are our hope and confidence, a new build-
ing well under way, if not completed, by September 1.

The board of trustees has authorized a new law
building, but the funds for construction must be raised.
The finance committee has no plan or hope beyond the
response it expects from the alumni, who have been
asked to raise $100,000. This is the amount needed for
the building. The insurance of $30,000 will be needed
for furnishing and equipping the building and replac-
ing the library with necessary working references.

The finance committee presented this problem to
the alumni in a general letter on February 14 and re-
sponses at the early date this is written are too few and
scattered to indicate a result.

Plans, however, are going forward in full confi-
dence that there will be funds at the only source the
University has.

The new law building, as you can see by the archi-
tects’ sketch, will on the exterior be almost a replica
of Newcomb Hall. It will give that impression. In de-
tail, there will be variances as there must be to make
the new building in harmony with Washington Col-
lege, whose adjacent dignity and simplicity and super-
iority make deviations from Newcomb Hall necessary
in order that it may sit beside the finest architecture
we have.

This problem has focused sharp and critical atten-
tion on both Newcomb Hall and Washington College.

The New Law Building ane

By James R. Caskrik, Lynchburg, Virginia, Che

It has brought to light, and new appreciation, the greater architec
tural beauty we have in the original building which is Washington
College. In dignity, simplicity, dimension, and proportion, it 15
one of the fine historical monuments of the period in this whole
country. A new building that dares to stand neighbor to anything
as graceful and right in line and form as Washington College has
to be designed with a precise eye and nice feeling.

. - . . <
The tentative plans for the proposed building made by O®&%

firm of Carneal, Johnston & Wright, of Richmond, Va., have been
received with much enthusiasm and satisfaction. The plan for the
interior arrangement of lecture rooms, library, professors’ offices,
the dean’s office, washrooms, a lounge for students, a special room
for briefing, a vault for records, a place for storage, an auditorium
in the plan of a moot court room, and all details planned for a
small but probable increase in student enrollment have pleased

everybody concerned.
Philip Small, of Cleveland, a nationally known designer and

critic of the Georgian period, has been engaged as consultant. He

will review the design and the plans and be responsible directly to,
the board of trustees for the final correctness of detail and that
indefinable quality that is “feeling.”

a More Beautiful Campus

of the Building Committee on the New Law Building

The above is in the nature of a report from the two committees
charged with the responsibility that ultimately will replace the
law building.

It is easy to address an appealing word to those whose minds
can instantly recall the picture and the associations at Washington
and lee. I am sure I need suggest no vision more forceful or more

compelling than the beauty of the colonnade with its symmetry
completed and its harmony fulfilled for all time.

It is an arresting thought that there are still men whose mem-
ories go back to the days when General Lee was president of
Washington College, and that some of them have great-grandsons
here today. ‘Those two generations, and all in between, are able
to have their first opportunity to see the colonnade at Washington
and lee in the completed form the original and unknown designer
of Washington College would have wished it to be.

 

The editors of The Alumni Magazine were so impressed with
the reaction of Matthew Page Andrews to the proposed new law
school, that his letter is being passed along to you. Mr. Andrews,
living now in Baltimore, was the subject of a biographical sketch
in The Alumni Magazine last fall.

Lpa8i

 

Dear “Cy”—

When, in the latest Un-
iversity Bulletin, I saw the
architects’ drawing of the
proposed new law building,
I thought it was all right.
At once I observed that its
construction would har-
monize with the campus
outline; but I knew that
the present board of trus-
tees and President Gaines
would not have it otherwise.

Then came the archi-
tects panorama of the en-
tire group of buildings as
they would look with Tuck-
er Hall restored — no, I
mean transfigured and glor-
ified. My enthusiasm is end-
less, as I picture that im-
pressively dignified, yet al-
together lovely front, with
Washington Hall as its an-
cient yet ever beautiful and_ traditional centerpiece.

My first thought comes from a desire to show this
vision of pure architectural beauty to everyone I see
and I would send it to others with whom I correspond.
I would ask them all if nature and this slope-crowded
line, when completed, will not unite to make the Wash-
ington and Lee campus the most truly inspirational in
these United States—save one only rival, and I would
mention that one, were I not afraid of turning the head
of a Virginia immortal, America’s first great architect,
Thomas Jefferson.

The above conjecture as to creative preeminence

 

would be freely ventured as an out-and-out declaration ;
but having, in the field of history, been so long ac-
customed to gathering all the evidence, to say nothing
of the pre-publication imprimatur of specialists, I ten-
tatively qualify what may be called intuitive assurance.

Please send me some copies of the panorama and
let me help get a consensus of opinion. And if the sight
of the vision will aid in making the dream come true,
so much the better for the immediate realization of a
noble ideal of structural harmony that must necessarily
ennoble all so fortunate as to be associated with it; for
the new harmony cannot but add to the spiritual en-
dowment created by the original interest of Washing-
ton and the subsequent presence of Lee. 7

He Saw Tut-ankh-Amen’s Coffin Opened

Se EVENTS of recent times have created such

ae world-wide interest as the opening of the tomb
of Tut-ankh-Amen, and few men were privileged to
see the sarcophagus lid of that Pharoah’s coffin lifted.

3ut an alumnus of Washington and Lee was there
when modern men first gazed on the mummy of that
ancient Egyptian.

The man is J. O. Knott, now of Washington, D. C.,
who took his degree from the University in 1907 while
serving as pastor of the Methodist church in Lexing-
ton. His has been an interesting life: thirty times he
has crossed the Atlantic: many books he has written—
but read here his story of the opening of Tut-ankh-
Amen’s coffin:

“One cold January, ten or twelve years ago, after I
had visited Egypt for several winters in succession, |
was about to sail again for that exotic land, with a
small party. A day or two before sailing, the Egyptian
Legation made its first appearance in Washington,
quartered at the Willard Hotel. Surmising that they
would like to send some word back home, I paid them
a visit, and received a most enthusiastic welcome. In
parting, the secretary handed me a card which he said
would “admit me to anything in Egypt.” It was signed
‘“Hassenein Bey.”

“T little dreamed what an Aladdin’s Lamp I held in
my hand until on arriving in Cairo, I presented this
pencil-signed card, ‘introducing Dr. Knott.’ The name
“Hassenein Bey” went echoing through the halls of
the Egypt government buildings. Doors flew open at
my approach. The very “holy of holies” of Egypt was
none too good for me—for I held in my hand direct
word from “Hassanein Bey.” After seeing the “‘secre-
tary of state,” I had au audience with the then premier,
Zoglool Pasha, who asked me what he could do for me.
This was my great chance: “Your excellency, I wish to
see the tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen,” I said. “That can be
arranged,” he said, and I received a permit which read
that I could enter the tomb on February 17. But on ar-
riving at Luxor, which is six miles from the tomb, I
saw Lord and Lady Astor and other dignitaries at the
hotel, and discerned that something unusual was about
to happen. I soon learned. that the sarcophagus lid of
the Pharoah (dead now for thirty-four hundred years)
was to be lifted on February 12. I at once wired to
Cairo for a change in the date of permit, and to my

astonishment received reply that if I agreed to go in
alone, without my party, I could enter the tomb on
that date. This is how and why I was there on that
epochal occasion.

“The preliminary examination of the mummy took
place, of course, in the presence of some twenty scien-
tists and government officials, as was necessary, for
none of them knew what would happen when they
lifted that lid. 1 was among four others to be admitted
just afterwards. I do not know who the others were,
nor did I ask. The excitement of the moment was such,
that every one of us concentrated attention on the
mummy and not on the “other fellow.” I do know,
however, that the sensationalist who lectured in New
England on the “Curse of King Tut,” and who says he
“sneaked in” without being observed when the sarcoph-
agus was opened up, is a fake; for no one could pass
that double guard without being stopped and his permit
examined. Further, even Dr. Howard Carter met his
Waterloo with the Egyptian Government (for the time)
by attempting to have a person enter the tomb without
permission from the government.

“The tomb or cavity was sixteen steps in depth,
which is very shallow compared with other tombs of
Egyptian Pharoahs. Some are hundreds of feet deep.
But since Tut-ankh-Amen died quite young and had
reigned only a few years, his rock-hewn tomb, which is
always begun when the man enters upon his reign, had
time only for little penetration of the rock in the moun-
tain side. But as I went alone down these sixteen steps,
in utter darkness, they seemed to me like entering into
an old-time country cellar. On reaching the end of the
descent, I turned to the right, and met the glare of elec-
tric lights. Wires had been connected with the power
house at Luxor and temporary light had thus been con-
veyed to the tomb.

“After all, mere descriptions are boresome, even
when one sees so interesting a sight as I beheld that
day. Probably “impressions” are more _ interesting.
Looking down upon a perfectly dazzling sheen of gold,
modeled in form of a man, with large black eyes of
obsidian gazing wildly at visitors, the sense of looking
at a man who lived in the time of Moses, made me feel
that the clock of life had been suddenly turned back
and I was living in strangely far-off days. I could hear
my own heart in its thumps, saying. ““Moses was learn-

[ 18 ]

 

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

ed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.’’ And here were
evidences of such art, taste, ability to preserve a body,
ability to produce a likeness of a man in gold, that
nothing in our own day could surpass and even rival.
This sight seemed to turn my entire mental outlook
upside down and rightside in. I have never doubted
since that we have an entirely wrong conception of
Egyptian life in the days of Moses. It is from Egypt
that civilization came. All that the Jew had which was
worth while, he got from Egypt, through Moses, who
was Egypt trained and to all purposes an Egyptian.

But this aside: Pharoah Tut-ankh-Amen (which
means “Tut, the favorite of god, Amen’) lay in that
upper coffin, (under which were other coffins and then
the dried-up and brittle mummy itself) with a flail in
his left hand, and a crook in his right. The “crook,”
with its stripes, looked to me exactly like those sugar
canes of peppermint which we used to see in candy
stores on Christmas occasions. The flail and crook
symbolized protection and punishment—for a Pharoah
had both in his power.

The head gear, above the beautiful gold face, was
decorated with the outstanding cobra, whose head pro-
truded over the forehead, and on that head hung a gar-
land of flowers, with the colors, after over thirty cen-
turies, still observable. This last touch of his child
wife’s love was a pathetic sight. When the other cof-
fins were opened up, more flowers were discovered, and
a funeral bouquet was found at the door of the tomb.

The decorations on the wall, which were in colors
much resembling what one sees in the Congressional
Library in Washington, were as fresh as though done
the day before we entered the tomb. In fact, everything
was so “recent” looking, that the effect was the more
startling. On coming out of this visit to past ages, into
the light of common day, I do not think that “common”
day ever seemed so much so. Everything in the world
about me seemed sordid. I had paid a visit to ancient
Egypt, and had talked with Moses, so to speak.

As for the “curse,” it is but necessary to say that
of the twenty-two persons who saw the tomb that day
(and it was at once closed afterwards to be opened no
more for a year) only two have died. This is about an
average of life, considering the ages of the people who
were there. I have never even considered such a thing
seriously. The reverence with which the body of the
Pharoah was treated, and the part he has played in re-
vealing to us the hoary past, should make King Tut in
glory a very happy man. When your readers go with
me to Egypt and see the display of wealth and anti-
quity there in the Cairo Museum, they will say: “The
half has never been told.”

A bit more work, with much of pain;
A sunshine gleam, then clouds and rain;
And yearnings vain; ambition dead,
And weariness of heart and head,

And then, earth's bed.

Ah! peaceful bed, so cool, so still,

So quiet, restful, calm, where will

No storm e’er come, no trouble blight,

No wrong be wrought, but all be right,
Beyond man’s nught!

May, 1909

The above poem, written by the late Dr. D. B.
Easter, beloved professor whose presence at Washing-
ton and Lee was a tradition, was discovered several
weeks ago in one of his old examination books. It
portrays the sensitive and keen nature of this man
who knitted himself into the soul of Washington and
Lee University. Mrs. Easter, now living in Baltimore,
has the original of the poem, which is reproduced
through her permission.

 

Two Get Virginia State Jobs

GovERNOR PerEryY of Virginia, himself a Washing-
ton and ee man, in January honored two alumni, ap-
pointing Wilbur C. Hall as chairman of the newly-
created state conservation and development commis-
sion, and Braden Vandeventer as a member. Mr. Hall,
who lives at Leesburg, Va., succeeds William E. Car-
son, and takes over heavy duties as head of a “dual”
commission. Mr. Vandeventer lives in Norfolk.

The appointments were made early in the new year,
and Mr. Hall assumed office at once. Considerable at-
tention was attracted to the new position, in view of
Virginia’s announced intention of stressing those two
state topics.

Mr. Hall is a member of the class of 1914; Mr.
Vandeventer a member of the class of 1897.

Fancy Dress Broadcast Wins Praise

ie. “SES NIGHT, January 25, 1935, Washington and

F Lee’s annual Fancy Dress ball was broadcast
over a nation-wide hookup of ninety-three stations and
was sent to Europe through short wave—over the Co-
lumbia Broadcasting System.

Response was immediate. Telegrams came from
scattered sections of the country, and several days later
letters began arriving at the alumni office from Wash-
ington and Lee men throughout the United States. All
were unanimous in appreciation of the broadcast, which
calls for an extra word of credit here:

The broadcast was made possible through the co-
operation of the Columbia Broadcasting System and
was put on at practically no cost to the University, the
only charges being for wire tolls. Columbia sent an
engineer and an announcer to lexington from Wash-
ington to handle the program, which was prearranged
by the publicity department at Washington and Lee in
cooperation with the program director of Columbia in
New York City.

So interesting were the letters to Cy Young and
“others responsible for the broadcast” that we repro-
duce excerpts from some of them:

The “Fancy Dress Broadcast” Friday night was
100 percent. I listened in while attending a little party
and those present not only enjoyed it thoroughly but
all were favorably impressed.—R. B. Pricw, 1921,
Hartford, Conn.

Broadcast great shades of yesterday. Puts St. Louis
alumni on feet-——Eppig Bacon, St. Louis.

Many congratulations on the broadcast Friday night,
which I was able to pick up on at least a dozen sta-
tions on my own radio. I thought the remarks made
by Dr. Gaines were both clever and exceedingly ap-
propriate for the occasion—JOoHN Morrison, Charles-
ton, West Virginia.

Just wanted to let you know that I was one of the
many ex-Generals who listened to the swell broadcast
of the Fancy Dress ball. It came in fine on WJSV
here and we had a little dance to make use of the
music.—EveErETT N. (Gus) Cross, 1932, Washing-
ton, D. C.

Enclose clippings from the three Detroit news-
papers announcing the broadcasting of Fancy Dress.
The program was immensely enjoyed by me. Dr.
Gaines, the “Swing,” the music, and above all, the
thought of sending it out to all of us scattered every-

where in this country, is appreciated. I told a number
of people around Michigan about the program and
friends here in Lansing commented on it.—CHAN
Gorpon, East Lansing, Michigan.

One hundred and twenty-five Philadelphia alumni
listening in. Reception perfect—E. Warinc WILson,
Philadelphia.

Congratulations to the person or persons respon-
sible for the broadcast of a portion of Fancy Dress
Ball. Anyone who had been a student at Washington
and Lee could not help but get a kick from the pro-
gram, for memories of undergraduate days were re-
freshened and lived again. Personally, if it is finan-
cially possible, i would suggest a broadcast of Fancy
Dress each year. This method, I believe, will bring re-
sults in that the interest of alumni will be stimulated,
particularly is this true of those of us who are at such
distant places that it is impossible for us to return for
an occasional visit—RaLtepn M. McLANg, Pensacola,
Florida.

As wired you, I got in touch with a number of in-
terested folks in this section of the state and have re-
ceived favorable reports from many of them who tuned
in on the Fancy Dress Ball program last night. The
reception was splendid and the whole broadcast sound-
ed very “peppy,” and I am sure created a very favor-
able impression. I am enclosing clipping of the broad-
cast from a local newspaper—H. Sr. G. T. Car-
MICHAEL, Kyrock, Ky.

I am enclosing a few tear sheets from Southern
California newspapers mentioning last night’s broad-
cast. There were several others but I could not find
them in the files. We had a bad break here as KHJ,
the local Columbia station, had a commercial program
on at that hour which it said could not be changed.
However, all the other Pacific Coast stations of the
Columbia system seemed to have had the program and
I am sure many of the brethren enjoyed it.

My own experience was a bit odd. I tuned in a San
Diego station and everything was o. k. for fifteen min-
utes when it had a local commercial program and cut
“us” off. Fortunately the announcement of the next
number had been given before San Diego retired so we
turned back the dial until we found a station playing
that piece and “sure nuff’ we were back on the campus
again. When the program was over and the station an-
nouncement made we were surprised to hear the latter

[ 20 |

 

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

 

portion of the broadcast came to us from Louisville,
Ky. We thought we were listening to Salt Lake City.
So the Bell family heard most of it even if we did have
to jump almost all the way across the country to do so.
Brian BeEtt, Los Angeles, Calif.

The Fancy Dress Ball broadcast was a striking suc-
cess. Hats off to the originator! The program came
over very distinctly and naturally was thoroughly en-
joyed. Of course, the highlight to me—and it must
have been to the thousands listening in—was the word
of greeting from President Gaines. Rarely have [ ever
known any man to handle the English language so
skillfully—Louis Knorr Koontz, Washington, D. C.

I thoroughly enjoyed the broadcast of Fancy Dress
Ball last night and I congratulate those responsible for
setting the Columbia System to put on the broadcast.
I am sure it must have warmed the heart of every alum-
nus who was listening in. Being one who loves the
place with no less than a passion, it was all I could do
to keep the old lump in the throat down when they got
to the “Swing.”—Joun Bett Tow1Lr, Augusta, Ga.

Please allow me to thank you for the lovely radio
concert from Doremus gymnasium last night. It was
a wonderful pleasure and experience to hear the or-
chestra play the various dance numbers and the ‘Swing.’
I also greatly enjoyed the talk of President Gaines and
was delighted that he was recovered from his recent
throat affection.

After listening to the concert last night, hearing
the “Swing” and the applause following same by the
euests of the dance, I was indeed proud to be an alum-
nus of old Washington and Lee University; and feel
that I am under many obligations to those who were
instrumental in arranging the fine program. I should
indeed appreciate it if you would express to Dr. Gaines,
whom I met here a few years ago, my appreciation of

the privilege that I enjoyed last evening. I was carried
back many years almost to the old days when I was a
student there. I feel very remiss at times that I did
not take my academic degree from the old school and
more, that I have done so little for the school since |
left-—Dr. Ruse. E. Exsersore, Norfolk, Va.

Am enclosing clippings from our two newspapers
and a sample of the postcards I sent out to every alum-
nus I know of in this section, advertising Fancy Dress.

The program came over great. In my opinion it was
a smart idea, that is to say, it furnished a real thrill to
all old Washington and Lee men who heard it and also
should prove very favorable advertising for the Uni-
versity. Sorry I couldn’t get down.—Jim MILBOURNE,
Baltimore, Md.

It is my custom to be in bed by nine o’clock, but
when Washington and Lee is involved I have to make
exceptions, consequently I sat up and listened to every
sound from first to last. There is something about
Washington and Lee that thrills me like nothing else.
There isn’t much to jazz over the radio but just the
fact that it was coming from Washington and Lee
made me sit and listen. It was interesting to hear a
nue who was listening in. Being one who loves the
the strains of the “Swing.” It was also most gratifying
to hear choice words from Dr. Gaines’ lips and to hear
his voice sound so clear and strong.

For my part you may say to the Columbia Broad-
casting System that they did a fine job and the recep-
tion was as perfect as it could have been right on the
floor. It was splendid in them to give such a broad-
cast, and I am sure that every old Washington and Lee
man is deeply grateful and thankful. There were no-
tices in all of the New Orleans papers. Nice publicity!
The magazine came yesterday and is always welcome.—
Pere Hamivton, New Orleans.

Local Alumni Association Notes

Greensboro

SLEET, RAIN and a little snow almost kept the Pied-
mont Alumni Association from having a speaker for
the Founder’s Day meeting at Greensboro, N. C., on
January 19.

Dr. Walter A. Flick, professor of education and
psychology at the University, was taken ill between
Lexington and Roanoke while en route to address the
Carolina Club, and at exactly one o'clock the afternoon
of January 19 your managing editor volunteered to pinch
hit for him, and set out accordingly for Tarheelia. Just
beyond Roanoke sleet began falling, most of it sticking
to the windshield of the managing editor’s car—so thick
did the stuff become that ye editor invested in an elec-
tric gadget to keep the windshield warm. It worked,
else the Piedmont alumni might still be sitting at the
O. Henry hotel waiting for someone to show up and
give them the lowdown on things at Lexington.

Ye managing editor held up the meeting fifteen min-
utes, and thought it loyal indeed that anyone would
brave the elements that night. But an enthusiastic group
attended the dinner, served in the green room of the
O. Henry hotel. (Compliments are tossed here to who-
ever planned that dinner—it was perfect).

Ye managing editor (forgive the repetition) de-
scribed the Tucker Hall fire, and spent about twenty
minutes praising Washington and Lee athletics, giving
due note to the coaches guiding the destinies of four
Southern conference championship outfits at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Dr. Henry Louis Smith, president-emeritus of the
University, spoke at the meeting, reminiscing of his
term of office here.

Those who attended included:

Mayor Roger W. Harrison of Greensboro, 1899;
R. R. Blake, 1912; D. Newton Farnell, Jr., 1924; A.
Stacey Gifford, 1924; J. D. Rogers, Jr., 1927; Macon
Cracker, 1932; Clarence Woods, 1933; Max Wood-
cock, 1932; Robert C. Potts (the “Daddy” Potts of
football fame who now is with the North Carolina
state highway commission), class of 1923; Dr. Smith:
and Richard P. Carter, 1929.

 

Louisville

FoorsaLt Coach Warren E. (Tex) Tilson address-
ed the annual meeting of the Washington and Lee

Alumni Association in Louisville on Saturday, Jan-
uary 19, at a banquet held at the Brown hotel. More
than thirty alumni attended.

H. Ed. Rietze, Jr., was elected president for the
coming year, succeeding Arthur Tabb. H. K. Hill, Jr.,
was elected vice-president, and Robert T. Foree as-
sumed the secretarial duties for the coming year, suc-
ceeding Murrel D. Klein.

Professor W. S. Milburn, principal of the Louis-
ville Male High school, gave a brief talk.

Among those present were:

New Orleans

AN ADDRESS on “Robert E. Lee,” a talk by one of the
great chieftain’s soldiers of the Army of Northern Vir-
ginia, and several short talks by special guests—to say
nothing of the enthusiastic gathering of 36 alumni
and fathers of alumni, made a notable occasion of the
annual dinner of the New Orleans Alumni Association
at Kolb’s Restaurant on January 19.

The Olympian Room was decorated in Blue and
White, which also was used in the refreshments, and
pictures of Lee and the old college lent by “Pete’’ Ham-
ilton gave an appropriate setting. A telegram from
President Francis P. Gaines and a good letter from Cy
Young were received with interest. Elmore G. Dufour,
president of the local association, to whom much credit
is due for the success of the get-together, presided.

Officers for the coming year were elected as follows,
after announcement of their choice by F. P. Hamilton
of the nominating committee: Norton I. Wisdom 1927,
president; O. H. Breidenbach 1911, vice-president ;
and W. W. Ogden 1923, secretary-treasurer.

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

O. H. Breidenbach, for the scholarship committee,
reported good news from the holder of the scholarship
this year, Hepburn Many, and said that the comunittee
was already actively interested in a student for next
year’s scholarship, as evidenced by the presence of J.
Woodruff George and his sons, Woodruff, Jr., and
Tabb, both prospective Washington and Lee men.

“I would that we had more men of Lee’s type in
this time of great need by our country,” said Rabbi
Louis Binstock, principal speaker of the evening, who
is widely known as a scholar and an orator of ability.
He was introduced by Dr. H. M. Blain as “one who
is especially appropriate for the subject, being a man
of the same high ideals as Lee and all alumni of Wash-
ington and Lee, who absorbed those ideals in that at-
mosphere surcharged with sacrificial service.”

The speaker based his address on the great biog-
raphy of Freeman, and after paying a tribute to Lee’s
genius for leadership, power of personality, and un-
tainted character, he refuted every structure of critics
of the great soldier, Christian gentleman, and educa-
tor, emphasizing the need now for men who are great
leaders, wise followers, and men actuated by such ideals
as are exemplified in the inspiring life of Robert
E.. Lee.

Lee as the soldier’s idol was described briefly by
D. W. Pipes, Sr., the father of three Washington and
Lee alumni, and a soldier in the Army of Northern
Virginia for three years of the war. He told of actual
instances that came under his observation of the affec-
tionate interest shown by the great commander in the
humblest of privates, and the almost incredible inspira-
tion of his presence to the soldiers.

Especially gratifying was the testimony of John
L.. Many, Jr., conveying the enthusiasm of his son over
the institution, the faculty, and the student body, and
his own gratitude to the association for having enabled
him to send his son to Washington and Lee. He said
he had sent three sons to college, each to a different
university, and he had no hesitation in placing Wash-
ington and Lee as his choice if he had a dozen more.

The excellence of the old college was set forth in
an interesting way by Dr. J. E. Winston, an alumnus
of other institutions, who declared that he hoped to be
able to send his young son there.

With an exhortation by the president-elect urging
co-operation in the activities of the coming year, and
the chorus of “The Swing’ led by him, the meeting
adjourned.

Alumni in attendance were:

Rev. W. M. Alexander, 1884; Douglas 5. Ander-
son, 1890; Hugh M. Blain, 1894; O. H. Breidenbach,

1911: H. M. Butler, 1912; Elmore G. Dufour, 1923;
Benjamin C. Eastwood, 1929; W. H. Fields, Jr., 1930;

Huntington

THe WASHINGTON AND LEE alumni association of
the tri-state region gathered in Huntington on Jan-
uary 21 for a banquet-meeting at the Frederick hotel
and unanimously elected Judge A. Wendell Mann of
Ashland, Ky., president for the coming year.

Other officers, all named unanimously like Judge
Mann, were chosen as follows: George Keller, Hunt-
ington, vice-president; Joe W. Dingess, Huntington,
secretary.

Judge Mann made a talk in which he included a re-
port of efforts being made by the Ashland members to
get new students for the University, and described
what was being done to assist some men already at
Washington and Lee. George Keller was appointed a
committee of one to see all members and obtain con-
tributions for the association’s use in aiding needy stu-
dents at the University from this area.

Joe Fitchett read to the alumni a bulletin from the
University under date of January 17, 1935, announc-
ing a broadcast from Doremus gymnasium on Friday
night, January 25. He also brought to the attention of
those present the fact that committees had been ap-
pointed in connection with the rebuilding of Tucker
Hall, which burned recently, and moved that this chap-
ter go on record as expressing sympathy to the Uni-
versity for the financial loss sustained, and expressing
willingness of full-co-operation with the committees.

The president appointed the following committee
to draft such a resolution, forwarding a copy of it to
the proper authorities:

W. T. Lovins, chairman; A. W. Mann; Philip P.
Gibson; J. W. Fitchett.

Judge Mann and Mr. Gibson expressed themselves
as feeling that the association should be of more active
service, especially in securing likely young men as stu-
dents for the University from this section, especially
from Huntington, and a committee was appointed to
function in this respect as follows:

[ 23 |

W. Roy Campbell, chairman; R. Lee Beuhring ;
Houston Laird.

Attention was called to the recent deaths of the
fathers of ‘T. J. C. Mayo and R. Lee Beuhring, and a
committee was appointed to draft proper resolutions.

Chicago

THE annual dinner of the Chicago Alumni was held
the evening of Founders’ Day, Saturday, January 19, at
the University club of Chicago. About twenty men were
present. Reuben A. Lewis, 1916, presided as toastmaster
and introduced among other speakers Edward A.O’ Neal,
1898, Dr. Herman P. Davidson, 1913, Col. Elijah Funk-
houser, 1893, and Philip P. Page, 1908.

The main address was made by Frank J. Gilliam, 1917,
dean of students, who represented the administration of
the university. Dean Gilliam’s talk dealt with some of
the distinctive phases of the program that the univer-
sity is attempting to carry out, with special emphasis
on the personnel work.

Plans were discussed looking to more active coopera-
tion with the university in the matter of securing the
right type of students from the Chicago section and to
the possibility of the alumni’s sponsoring a gathering
next year in conjunction with the Southern Society.

Those attending included Edward A. O’Neal, 1898,
Philip P. Page, 1908, Reuben A. Lewis, Jr., 1916, Dr.

attending “perhaps the most satisfactory gathering of
alumni ever held in Lynchburg.”

Brief talks also were made by James L. Caskie,
member of the board of trustees of Washington and
Lee; by Samuel L. Williams; and by Mosby G. Per-
row, Jr.
