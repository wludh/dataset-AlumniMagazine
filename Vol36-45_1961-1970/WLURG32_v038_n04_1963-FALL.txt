‘The Rededication
Of the Lee Chapel

President Cole, Benson Ford,
And Robert E. Lee, LV, Foin
In Pledging Renewed Emphasis
Of the Noble Ideals of Lee

ASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY rededicated its

historic Lee Chapel in a simple but impressive
ceremony in the Chapel’s auditorium on October 11th.

The simplicity of the formalities was in keeping
with that of the original dedication of the modest brick
and limestone structure that Robert E. Lee had built
to serve the spiritual needs of the students of Wash-
ington College. After commencement exercises there
in 1868, Lee reported to the college’s ‘Trustees that
the Chapel, ‘dedicated to the services of Almighty
God, is a pleasing as well as useful addition to the
College buildings.”

While the Chapel is no longer the scene of regular
religious services, as it was in Lee’s time, the rededica-
tion acknowledged the Chapel’s symbolism of the pro-
found Christian influence upon the life of the great
soldier and educator.

The six hundred persons who witnessed the mid-
afternoon ceremony heard brief remarks from Robert
E. Lee, IV, of San Francisco, who represented the Lee
descendants; from Benson Ford, president of the Ford
Motor Company Fund, from whose resources came the
gift of $370,000 which made possible the fourteen-
month restoration project; and from Washington and
Lee’s President Fred C. Cole.

FALL 1963

Each speaker emphasized the appropriateness of
the Chapel as a lasting monument to Lee’s memory,
not so much the memory of a military commander
but of an enlightened educator, a man whose life was
patterned on principles of duty, truth, and integrity.

Robert E. Lee, IV, great-grandson of the general
and a 1949 alumnus of the University, spoke first, des-
scribing his sentiments of the occasion:

“It is a feeling of great pride, an awareness of a
very strong personal link with our nation’s great past
and with one of the notable figures of history. ‘The
feeling is not one that I permit myself to savor very
often, and indeed, it is more precious because of the
infrequency with which it comes. But this sensation of
pride—and humility—is inescapable for me in these
surroundings.’

Mr. Ford declared that he and the others present
were rededicating “a memorial to greatness.”

“This Chapel,” he said, “holds deep meaning and
stirring memories for the people of the South. But it is
a shrine which belongs to a nation, for the man whose
memory this structure honors belongs to all America.
It is unfortunate that in spite of his fame, Robert E.
Lee, the man, is still unknown to many Americans. It
is not that his fame has been bounded by geography

3

 

or sectionalism. It is rather that too

many know him only as the gallant
leader of a vanquished army. There
are many, born in the shadow of his
greatness, who still do not know of
the traits that made him a giant
among men.

“Lee, the General, is already en-
shrined in history. Today, by this
rededication, we also honor Lee the
man of God, Lee the molder of
young minds, Lee the healer of raw
wounds. Today, our rededication
of this shrine reflects the length-
ening shadow cast by a great man
across almost a century.”

In his response to the remarks of
Mr. Lee and Mr. Ford, President
Cole reviewed briefly the years
spent by Robert E. Lee as _ presi-

4

dent of Washington College and of
the continuing influence exerted
upon the University by Lee’s fore-
sight as an educator.

“Yet, if one were challenged to
determine the area of Lee’s great-
est influence upon this University,”
President Cole said, ‘‘the answer
would not be concerned with the
academic curriculum, or the broad
geographic origins of the student
population, or similar tangible
evidences of Lee’s presence here.
His great contribution to this Uni-
versity affects not so much young
men’s intellect and learning as it
does their hearts, their character,
their attitude toward their fellow-
men.”

President Cole said “the climate

of student life” established in Lee’s
administration has developed into
traditions “passed from one student
generation to the next and guarded
jealously by each.”

‘No Washington and Lee student
since Lee’s time has graduated
without having been personally in-
volved in the preservation of these
traditions,” said the president, ‘‘and
I believe no student has graduated
who is not the better man for hay-
ing lived in a company of men so
guided by principles of honor,
integrity, and gentlemanly regard
for the rights of others.”

In expressing his gratitude to
the Ford Motor Company Fund for
making the restoration a reality,

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

 

President Cole said the University,
through the Chapel and the Lee
Museum there, will seek to em-
phasize the “enduring, universal
truths” that governed Lee’s life.
“We shall suggest,’’ he continued,
“that these lofty Christian princi-
ples and personal guidelines are as
timely and as important for pur-
poseful living today as they were
when Lee lived.”

‘Thus, in rededication of the
Lee Chapel today, we not only re-
affirm its heritage as a place of
worship, but we encompass in its
purpose a fitting tribute to the

service and devotion to Washing-
ton and Lee has spanned more
than half a century.” And student
body President William A. Noell,
Jr., of Bluefield, W. Va., was cited
as representative of a student body
which “lives and studies under a
code of honor and gentlemanly con-
duct established by President Lee.”

The invocation was given by
University Chaplain Dr. David W.
Sprunt, and the benediction was
pronounced by Dr. John N.
Thomas of the University’s Board
of ‘Trustees.

Among those attending the re-

If General Lee found the Chapel
“pleasing and useful” in 1868,
those who were present for the re-
dedication and the many _ thous-
ands of others who have visited the
restored Chapel at other times have
found it beautiful and inspiring.
‘The charm and dignity of the audi-
torium gains subtle emphasis from
the soft hghting and gentle colors
of wall, carpet, and woodwork. In
the museum, the Lee memorabilia
are presented in a well-lit, unclut-
tered arrangement of new mean-
ingfulness to visitors.

Perhaps the most pleasantly sur-

memory of a great Christian and his
influence upon this University and
his nation,’ President Cole said.
With the principal speakers on
the rostrum were other distin-
guished guests who were introduced
by President Cole prior to the re-
dedication remarks. Chancellor
Francis P. Gaines was recognized
as “one of the leading expositors
of Robert E. Lee and the South”
whose administration took first
steps toward the Chapel’s ultimate
restoration. Rector of the Board,
Dr. J. Morrison Hutcheson, was in-
troduced as an alumnus “whose

dedication were the Board of ‘Trus-
tees, other representatives of the
Ford Motor Company Fund, mem-
bers of the Virginia Division of the
United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy, members of the Lee Memorial
Foundation of Stratford, the Alum-
ni Board of ‘Trustees, officers of the
Parents) Advisory Council, the
faculty, student body representa-
tives, and other friends of the Uni-
versity and admirers of Lee. A re-
ception for the rededication partici-
pants was held at the home of Pres-
ident and Mrs. Cole following the
ceremony.

prising feature of the restored
Chapel is the beauty of the tonal
resonance of the Erben pipe organ,
also restored to original excellence.
Before the rededication, Professor
James G. Leyburn played an organ
prelude, and at the ceremony’s con-
clusion he accompanied the Uni-
versity’s seventy-voice Glee Club in
an anthem and “College Friend-
ships.”

It was a beautiful and moving
climax to what President Cole
called “one of the most significant
events to take place at Washington
and Lee University in many years.”

5

 

“IT am proud that the Ford Motor Company Fund partici-
pated in the preservation of this part of our American Heritage.
The restoration of this historic Chapel was a novel undertaking
for the Fund. For although we had often contributed to the sup-
port and advance of education, this was the first time we had
ever allocated funds for a project of historical restoration. We
made our decision to underwrite the restoration of the Lee
Chapel because we realized that this structure embodies some-
thing important for every American. We made our decision be-
cause we realized that, without our assistance, the University
might be forced to draw upon resources which could otherwise
be devoted to purely educational needs. We made our decision in
the spirit of my grandfather who believed strongly in the value
of reconstructing and preserving outstanding examples of our
national past as an inspiration and lesson for the future.

“As consecrated tomb, historical monument, museum, house
of worship, place of inspiration, this Chapel can, we believe,
cement anew and necessary understanding among all parts of our
nation. By dramatizing the selfless dedication of Robert E. Lee
to the principles of honor, human dignity, learning and ‘the
thorough education of all classes of people, this Chapel can be-
come a symbol of the fundamental values that unite us all. It
will truly enshrine the memory of Robert E. Lee. Then, per-
haps in years to come, people, in thinking of him, will not say
he led an army in the service of half a nation. Instead, they will
say he led a school in the service of all mankind.”

Excerpts from the Addresses
At the Rededication of Lee Chapel

“There are in Lee Chapel inescapable sug-
gestions of Lee’s greatness as a general and war
leader. It is appropriate that this be true, but we
are convinced that this should not be the primary
emphasis here. Here in this Chapel, which 1s
Lee’s last resting place, we propose to honor the
memory of Lee as a man of learning, as a man
of uncompromising principles of honor. We shall
seek to emphasize the enduring, universal truths
that governed Lee’s attitudes and his life, and we
shall suggest that these lofty Christian principles
and personal guidelines are as timely and as im-
portant for purposeful living today as they were
when Lee lived. And we shall suggest that the
admirable traditions that enrich the lwes of
Washington and Lee students are traditions
which can be shared by all Americans.”

—PRESIDENT FRED C. COLE

“There are many statues, many memorials
and tributes to Robert E. Lee throughout our
country, but I know I speak for all Lee descen-
dants when I say that this Chapel is the most
honored monument to his memory of all. It ts
comforting to me, and I know it is comforting to
all members of the Lee family that the Chapel
has been so beautifully restored and that its
future preservation is assured. The memory of
Robert E. Lee is not solely the possession of his
descendants, for he is a part of history, and he
belongs to all Americans, of both North and
South. This Ghapel, as a symbol of the ideals
and purposes of Robert E. Lee which so many of
us strive imperfectly to achieve, will inspire many
thousands of Americans in the future, as it has in
the past.”

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

 

 

 

 

Prior to the reopening of Lee Chapel in Au-
gust, the Roanoke ‘Times published a special,
sixteen-page supplement on the Chapel, the
restoration project, and related topics. The sup-
plement was prepared under the personal super-
vision of BARTON W. Morris, '43, executive editor
of the Times-World Corporation of Roanoke,
who was ably assisted by FReD P. LOEFFLER, °48,
Times state editor, and many other members of
the ‘Times staff, as well as by A. PRescorr RowE,
assistant director of Information Services at the
University and Curator of Lee Chapel.

The supplement represented the best accu-
mulation of information about the Chapel ever
assembled at one time. Below and on _ four
following pages are several stories from the
supplement, and in subsequent issues of the
Alumni Magazine, additional features about the
Chapel will appear from time to time. Much of
the historical and descriptive material is familiar
fo alumni, but they may find these accounts of
particular interest for their school-age children.

The Many Problems of Restoration
Were a Challenge to Its Supervisor

By RANDY ARMBRISTER

ILLIAM L. Dopp, an expert

builder for the Lynchburg
construction firm of John P. Petty-
john Co., once lived in Lexington
but until June 1962 “had never set
foot in Lee Chapel.”

Fourteen months later he knew
as much, or more, about the physi-
cal aspects of the historic old struc-
ture as any man alive.

 

RANDY ARMBRISTER is head of the

Roanoke ‘Times Shenandoah Val-

ley Bureau which is located in
Lexington.

FALL 1963

The 45-year-old native of Bu-
chanan was construction supervi-
sor for the infinitely complex pro-
ject of restoring the beautiful
Chapel built in 1867 while Gen.
Robert E. Lee was president of
the college on whose campus it
stands.

The $370,000 renovation job
was Bill Dodd’s first such assign-
ment. He has spent nearly a quar-
ter of a century in the building pro-
fession, he says, with most of those
years consumed in putting up new
structures.

But the soft-spoken man frankly

admits he’s “‘not ashamed of the
job at all—in fact, I feel kind of
proud of it.”

Renovation of the lovely but
aged chapel at Washington and
Lee University was not an easy
task. Dodd says “A new building
can be done with one-third the
headaches.”

‘The knotty problems arose from
three major causes:

Reinforcing the ancient brick
building in floors, walls and roof;

Keeping accurate track of all
original materials so they could be
put back in proper place;

 

And the third, possibly most dif-
ficult headache, was brought on—
not by aged bricks and woodwork—
but by people; visitors and “‘side-
walk superintendent” types, Dodd
recalls with characteristic calm.

hese ..“'problem: “people, the
construction chief explained, were
not folks connected with Washing-
ton and Lee University who might
have been anxious over the disturb-
ance of the cherished landmark. In
fact, “I’ve never worked a job yet
where the people who had to do
with it had less criticism,’ Dodd
said in praise of the school person-
nel.

And the difficult ones were not
Civil War “buffs,’’> nor members of
patriotic organizations—nor for the
most part, even Virginians. Instead
they were the ones Dodd pungent-
ly described as ‘“‘a few out-of-stat-
ers—who had their opinions as to
what was going on, without know-
ing what was going on!”

They also “couldn’t see where
all that money was going.”

Dodd is an understanding easy-
going person with respect to others,
however, and the amateur experts
didn’t disturb him much.

The stubbornly curious sight-
seers were the ones who helped age
him he said. It made no apparent
difference to these that the Chapel
had been officially closed at the be-
ginning of the work to prevent pos-
sible injury to visitors. Elaborate
and polite signs erected here and
there by school officials explaining
the project and why visitors
couldn’t enter the Chapel seeming-
ly made little impression.

They were quite
even when Dodd would personally
warn them of danger—from falling
objects, as the roof came down—or
of plunging through the disman-
tled flooring to the museum below.

nonchalant

“They'd just stand there and look
at you,’ Dodd commented, mild
curiosity about the ways of men still
evident in his voice.

Then he hit upon the solution

 

Steel replaced wooden beams.

to the problem—a simple and direct
one. ‘The persistent visitors stop-
ped short, unquestioningly, when
confronted at the Chapel door by
a flimsy cord strung across the
opening with a little piece of card-
board worded: KEEP OUT—FLOORS
HAVE BEEN SANDED. “Very effective,’
Dodd observed.

The construction supervisor had
plenty of professional help for the
restoration project. In addition to
subcontractors handling
phases of the work, Dodd, had the
services: of D; KE. “Pat' Brady, Jr.,
Washington and Lee’s superintend-
ent of buildings and grounds.

And both Dodd and Brady need-
ed plenty of help; it was learned
that one back wall of the Chapel’s
clock tower would have to come

certain

 

out due to its dangerous. state.

“Frankly, I was afraid to fool
with it,’ Dodd admits. But the wall]
was taken out, strengthened, and
rebuilt—every brick back in place.

The necessary structual  rein-
forcement for the nearly 100-year-
old Chapel in fact “is where most
of that money went to, folks kept
asking about,’ Dodd noted. “You
can’t see it, but its there—inside.”’

Remarkably little of the original
building was replaced. Most of the
pieces which are substitutes were
the necessary, and concealed, steel
braces and trusses taking the place
of unsafe wooden ones.

Fven the slate shingles from the
roof were individually marked to
assure each would be returned to
its place—as was each strip of floor-
ing, and the sections of milled
woodwork.

The task Dodd’s
renovators faced is revealed for ex-
ample, in the fact that the Chap-
el’s side walls were “bowing” out
as the old trusses “began to give
way, here and there.”

monumental

Dodd reports that the combined
bulge of both walls measured g and
3/4 inches! And the roof was off
keel. After installing new, safe roof
supports it was found that the rear
ceiling of the Chapel would need
to be lowered by 8 and 3/4 inches—
all because the original roof had
“different piches for the front and
rear gables.”

The veteran builder
know why this was, though he feels
it “probably was an error, since
back then they worked from day
to day with what they had.”

‘The work of John P. Pettyjohn
Co., and construction supervisor
Bill Dodd on famous Lee Chapel is

doesn’t

done now, after fourteen fascinat-
Dodd currently is
working on an addition to a Win-
chester utility firm. It has less head-
aches but nothing like the chal-
lenge of Lee Chapel, he noted. It
sounded as if his usually carefree
voice reflected a note of sadness.

XHIBITIONS REVOLVING around
KE the three most © significant
phases of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s life
are featured in the museum of
Washington and Lee University’s
newly restored Lee Chapel.

The principal theme of the first-
floor Lee Chapel Museum is “The
‘Three Faces of Lee’’ and the hun-
dreds of historical items owned by
the university are displayed to re-
flect Lee as a soldier, an educator,
and a gentleman. Items are
grouped in eight specially designed
and custom-built display cases.

Although emphasis in the 14-
month preservation project at the
chapel was on restoration, changes
were made in the nearly 100-year-
old building to assure its future
permanence and enhance its appeal
to its many thousands of annual
visitors. Considerable remodeling
work was done in the museum area

FALL 1963

Chapel Museum Theme Depicts Lee
As Soldier, Educator, and Gentleman

By A. PReEscoTr ROwE, ’60

to aid in the effective display of Lee
and Lee family memorabilia.

‘The Lee Chapel Museum, first
opened to the public on January
19, 1928, is housed in a large room
that served for many years as the
headquarters and meeting room of
the YMCA of the university. A
smaller room, in which the muse-
um shop is located, was used for the
offices of the university treasurer
during the late 1800’s. ‘The third
room on the first level is the small
ofhce used by Gen. Robert E. Lee
from 1867 to 1870. General Lee
was president of Washington Col-
lege (now Washington and Lee) for

 

A. Prescotr Rowe, ‘60, formerly curator

of the Chapel Museum, is now with Rey-

nolds Metals Company’s public relations
staff in Richmond,

five years beginning in 1865.

Lee’s office was completely re-
stored during the preservation pro-
ject, and the original furniture in
the room has been arranged by
museum personnel as it presumably
was when General Lee last used
the office on September 28, 1870.

Across the hall from General
Lee’s office is the Lee family crypt,
where the famous Confederate lead-
er is buried along with his wife,
children, and other members of his
family.

‘The museum and its shop are
done in a beige motif with monk’s
cloth stretched over several walls
to facilitate the hanging of paint-
ings and historical photographs. In
the center of the main room of the
museum is a three-sided wall sur-
rounding a stone that marks the
place where Robert E. Lee was
buried for 13 years (1870 to 1883).

9

In 1883, his remains were removed
to the Lee family crypt. ‘The crypt
was added to the chapel that year
along with the chamber housing
the famous Valentine recumbent
statue of Lee.

Over the original grave marker
is a large oil portrait of Lee in his
Confederate general’s uniform. ‘The
painting was done in 1934 by
James Montgomery Flagg, creator
of the famous World War I “Uncle
Sam” recruiting poster. Photo-
graphs of Lee’s funeral on October
15, 1870, also are displayed in this
area.

‘The center walls—an addition to
the museum area—are the keystones
for the exhibition scheme. In each
of the three bays in the center are
large photomurals of Lee. The first
was taken by Civil War photogra-
pher Matthew Brady and shows the
famed commander in his uniform
shortly after his surrender at Ap-
pomattox in April, 1865. The sec-
ond is also a Brady photograph
taken in 1869 during Lee’s presi-
dency of Washington College. The
third blow up is Michael Miley’s
dramatic head and __ shoulders
photograph taken nine months be-
fore Lee died. It is believed by
historians to be the last photo-
graph taken of the general.

Under each of these murals are
display cases for the most represen-
tative items of Lee’s life as soldier,
educator, and gentleman (family
man). Wall cases opposite each of
these central display areas also are
arranged to accent these three
phases of Lee’s life.

Each exhibition case, furnished
with its own source of light, is
finished with a smooth surface of
beige with flecks of gold. ‘The cases
are outfitted with casters for mobil-
ity and versatility in changing ex-
hibits. |

Exhibitions will be changed from
time to time in an effort to display
more effectively all of the items
owned by or loaned to the univer-
sity. No exhibit schedule has been

A young Chapel visitor views the portrait of Lt. Lee.

arranged to date, however.

One of the museum’s most val-
uable holdings is its art collection.
Probably the most famous portrait
in the million-dollar collection is
the Charles Willson Peale portrait
of George Washington. This vi-
brant painting shows Washington
in the uniform of colonel in the
Virginia Militia, a British Army
unit. It was done while Washing-
ton was in his go’s. ‘The Edmund
West portrait of Lt. and Mrs. Rob-
ert E. Lee also are significant ones
in the collection. These were done
in the late 1830's when the Lees
were quite young. The portrait of
General Lee shows him in his U.S.
Army lieutenant’s uniform. ‘This
West portrait of Mrs. Lee is the
only one for which she ever sat.

Other paintings displayed in the
museum include one of Ann Carter
Lee, General Lee’s mother, and the
John Wollaston portraits of Mr.
and Mrs. Daniel Parke Custis and
their children, John Parke and
Martha Custis. ‘The Custises were
ancestors of Mrs. Robert E. Lee.
A portrait of George Washington
Custis Lee, General Lee’s son who
succeeded his father as_ president
of Washington and Lee, also is dis-

played in the museum. The young-
er Lee gave the university the Peale
portrait plus a number of the oth-
er paintings in the museum. In the
auditorium is the well-known
‘Theodore Pine portrait of General
Lee,

An electrical track in the ceiling
of the museum provides for special
spotlights for each of the portraits
and other special exhibits.

Many of the remodeling changes
in the Lee Chapel Museum were
recommended by Dr. Kenneth W.
Prescott, managing director of the
Academy of Natural Sciences in
Philadelphia and special consultant
for the museum.

Each item in the museum’s hold-
ings has been carefully catalogued
by Mrs. Marjorie Crenshaw, wife of
the head of the university’s history
department. Today, every item in
the museum has its own identifica-
tion number as well as four file
cards relating its historical signif-
icance, donor and date given or
loaned to the museum.

During the cataloguing project,
attention was also given to the res-
toration of the historical items.
‘This restoration work was done by
I. L. Hancock, HI, of Lexington.

EMORIES BURN the brightest in

Lee Chapel for those who re-

ceived their education at Wash-
ington and Lee University.

This could be because of the
historical significance of the struc-
ture, built by a man whose influ-
ence is still felt a century later, but
perhaps it is more because much
of the W&L student’s life centers
around the building.

It is here that one attended his
first student meetings and heard of
the traditions that were to become
a way of life. And the philosophy
of Robert E. Lee, whose recumbent
statue could be seen beyond the
rostrum, became very much a living
ideal.

Robert E. Lee, perhaps more
than any other person, created the
traditions of conduct that govern
Washington and Lee a century lat-
er. One heard about the man and
his way of life from Dr. Francis P.
Gaines, former university president
and now chancellor who became a
living legend in his own time.

Through the four years that were

The wide-angle lens pro-
vides a striking view of
the Chapel’s restored in-
terior. Only the Peale
portrait of Washington
and the Pine portrait of
Lee are displayed now in
the auditorium. Other
portraits that once hung
there are now in the Mu-
seum or on display else-
where at the University.

Thoughts of

An Alumnus

By Fred LOEFFLER, 48

to follow much of what happened
within the ivy covered walls of the
building became mileposts along
the road to graduation.

And often as one sat on those
hard and ungiving benches which
left a lasting impression on one’s
mind and elsewhere, eyes strayed
from the speaker to the wall behind
where hung the portraits of those
who contributed more than their
share to future generations.

And once the college career
reached its culmination, here was
where the degrees were conferred
on a hot day in early June. Some
of those who received their diplo-
mas might not have reflected on it
that day, but later they came to
realize just what the building and

its builder meant in their own
lives.

Last year contributors to the
annual Alumni Fund drive re-
ceived a nail from Lee Chapel en-
cased in plastic. ‘These handmade
nails were available because of the
restoration of the building whose
creaky balcony had long indicated
the need for such a project.

The nails themselves were more
than mere mementoes. Whether
they realize it or not, most of those
who attended college on the Lex-
ington campus could indirectly as-
sociate much with the nails—the
voices, names and faces that will
remain a permanent part of their
memories.

In just a few days, still another
homecoming will cause a_ large
number of W&L graduates to re-
turn to Lexington. And as in the
past, a visit to Lee Chapel will be
a part of their schedule.

‘They will find some changes, but
it stands much as it has for almost
a century—a monument to a man,
a philosophy and a way of life.

point the Generals found them-
selves burdened with the unaccus-
tomed stigma of a two-game losing
streak.

Playing before friendly home
crowds in the first three games, the
Generals disposed of Randolph-
Macon, 28-0; Oberlin, 29-13; and
Centre, 28-8. Next came an inva-
sion of Pennsylvania and a show-
down with Susquehanna Univer-
sty, a team like the Generals whose
powerful running attack had failed
to bring the Crusaders victory only
once in their last 31 games. It
shaped up as a small college Don-
nybrook, and it was just that, al-
though the 31-0 score by which the
Generals fell does not accurately
suggest their stubborn reluctance
to bow. At game’s end, the Gener-
als loaded their wounded on the
Lexington-bound bus, while eight
Crusaders checked in at the local
hospital for X-rays and other treat-
ment.

Back in Virginia for the renewal
of the long-standing rivalry with
Hampden-Sydney, Coach McLaugh-
lin scratched three injured regu-
lars and as many second unit men
from the ready roster, and hoped
for the best against the fired-up
Tigers, who were having one of
their best years. The defense on
both sides was brilliant, and four
times the Generals denied the Tig-
ers scoring bids, while W&L
scratched out eleven points on a
field goal and a touchdown run
with an intercepted fumble. Hamp-
den-Sydney got a begrudged touch-
down in the fourth period, and
then, after driving nearly to the
Tiger 20, a penalty on a crucial
fourth down play stalled the W&L
drive, and Hampden-Sydney was
in business again.

The Tigers crunched out two
first downs and then let fly with a
long pass to the 15-yard line where
General safety man _ Bill David
gathered the ball in with two arms
and a broad chest and crashed to
the ground. The ‘Tiger receiver

FALL 1963

scrambled onto David, wrapped
one arm around the ball, just in
time for the official to arrive from
downfield, rule a simultaneous
catch and award Hampden-Sydney
the first down. It still took Hamp-
den-Sydney five plays to
against the disheartened Generals,
but there were only forty-five sec-
onds left and it wasn’t enough to

change the 12-11 final count.

SCcOre

‘The two-game skid ended the
next week in Lancaster with a 28-6
triumph over Franklin & Marshall.
‘Then it was up the mountain to Se-
wanee, where another band of ‘Tig-
ers were growling and _ scratching
more fiercely than in Death Valley.
No one had come close to Sewanee
in six games, and in tailback M. L.
Agnew the Tigers had one of the
country’s best and most versatile
backs. Again, the final score in
Sewanee’s favor, 35-6, does not re-
flect the 60-minute ferocity of play.
The Tigers were long ball hitters
that day, catching the W&L defense
napping on a half-dozen key long-
range plays that brought touch-
downs or made subsequent scores
possible. A week later, the Tigers
edged past Washington to climax
one of their finest years, unbeaten
and champions of the College Ath-
letic Conference.

The Generals, still injury-ridden,
came back to bounce Southwestern
at Memphis, 36-12, in a Wilson
Field contest. The final contest
with Washington University, which
would have decided second place
in the conference, was canceled be-
cause of the President’s death.

While injuries were perhaps a
key factor in every loss, there were
other influences that worked
against the Generals. There was
maybe a touch of “senioritis”
among some of the seventeen final-
year veterans. And with seniors
seemingly entrenched in all start-
ing positions, Coach McLaughlin
didn’t achieve the spirited compe-
tition for Blue Unit berths that he
hoped for from the younger play-

ers. The new substitution rules
prevented McLaughlin from play-
ing his sophomore-dominated third
unit as much as normal in other
years, and the same rule all but
eliminated the possibility of the
helpful advice from the bench that
would punch in the touchdown or
get a drive rolling.

But there were outstanding in-
dividual efforts. Halfback Henry
Sackett gained more yards rushing
(633) than any runner since Walt
Michaels’ great work in 1950. End
Buck Ogilvie’s blocking and _tack-
ling rattled opponents’ bones while
he boned up for interviews as a
Rhodes Scholar candidate. Tackle
Jim Sylvester, another Honor Roll
student, got straight A’s in Mc
Laughlin’s grade book, too, and
halfback Bull David established
himself as one of the Generals’ best
pass catchers and pass defenders of
any era.

But the season was a winning
season, and it helped complete a
winning pattern at W&L this fall.
Coach Dick Miller’s cross-country
runners outdistanced six of their
seven opponents, and_ freshman
Charlie Head set a new school rec-
ord for the home course in the final
meet.

Coach Joe Lyles’ soccer team dis-
played a good scoring punch, but
they failed to win some close ones
and reluctantly settled for a highly
respectable 7-5 season. Lyles’ de-
velopment of soccer talent, both on
the varsity and freshman levels, has
brought the game to a new popu-
larity in W&L athletics.

Finally, as a bright promise of
future happy Saturdays at Wilson
Field, the freshman football team
turned in a winning season for the
first time since 1948. Coach Dana
Swan's Brigadiers lost their first
two games to Woodberry Forest
and Staunton Military Academy,
but they rallied to win four straight
over Augusta Military, Bridgewater
College Jayvees, Randolph-Macon
Academy, and Hargrave Military.

The Bankers of 1929—
A Distinguished Recor

Led by the Class of 1929,
Washington and Lee Alumni

Hold Important Top Positions

In Nation’s Foremost Banks

F MANY CAREERS in which
Washington and Lee alumni

excel, one of the most noteworthy
is banking. Indeed, a member of
the University’s Board of ‘Trustees,
Joseph E. Birnie of the Class of
1927, is President of the Bank of
Georgia. The total number of al-
umni serving as bank presidents is
in the dozens, and more than forty
alumni hold senior-officer positions
in banks each having assets in ex-
cess of one hundred million dol-
lars. A recent survey to determine
the qualities that contribute to the
making of executives of large banks
recorded Washington and _ Lee
in a fifth-place tie with the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania among colleges
most productive of presidents of
the nation’s 300 largest commercial
banks. Only Harvard, Yale, Michi-
gan, and Princeton contributed
more men to the group, and Har-
vard’s high rank depended entire-

16

ly upon its Graduate School of
Business.

Among the 300 largest American
banks there are six having Wash-
ington and Lee men as presidents
(of which only five were uncovered
by the survey cited above). ‘Three
of these men took the BS in Com-
merce degree as members of the
same class—1929g—long called “‘the
bankers’ class’” and a class whose
total achievements mark it as one
of the great ones in the history of
the University. Four other class-
mates have reached vice-presiden-

By JoHN McK. Gunn, Jr.

cies of major New York banks, and
at least eight other *Iwenty-Niners
have attained positions of leader-
ship in banking. Additional mem-
bers of the class serve as bank di-
rectors. Among these is another
‘Trustee of the University, Lewis F.
Powell, Jr., who took his B.S. in
Commerce degree magna cum
laude, went on to become President
of the Student Body, and then to be
the first-ranking law graduate in
1931. Mr. Powell is more celebrat-

Elect of the American Bar Associa-

 

Joun McK. Gunn, °46, is assistant profes-
sor of economics at Washington and Lee.
His interest in the careers of University
alumni is unbounded, and this article on
banking is the result of one of several
studies he is making that reflect the im-
pact made by Washington and Lee men
upon the nation’s economic, social, and
political life.

tion, but among his many, demand-
ing responsibilities is a director-
ship of Richmond’s State-Planters
Bank of Commerce and Trusts.

A career in banking is particu-
larly fitting for graduates of a col-
lege that seeks to develop com-
munity leaders, where ‘“commun-
ity’ is given both large and flexible
definition. This is true because
bankers affect so importantly the
economic development of a com-
munity, are drawn almost unavoid-
ably to exercise leadership through-
out a community's life, and through
their aggregate influence have
much control of the nation’s entire
resources.

Big Bank Presidents

First among the *“ITwenty-Nine
bank presidents according to the
size of his bank is Adrian McCar-
dell, President of the First National
Bank of Maryland, whose total as-
sets approach half a billion dol-
lars. Mr. McCardell added a Harv-
ard MBA to his W&L diploma,
served for ten years as a national
bank examiner, then entered Na-
val service during World War II
and gained the rank of Command-
er:

Following the War he became
Vice-President of the Seaboard Cit-
izens National Bank of Norfolk,
whose current President is James
Hoge ‘Tyler, III, BA 1931 and LLB
1933. Mr. McCardell moved briefly
to Charleston, West Virginia, then
to Baltimore in 1958. He was ele-
vated to his present office in May
1961. Outside the bank, Mr. Mc-
Cardell holds positions in the Boy
Scouts of America and in the Na-
tional Conference of Christians and
Jews.

Allen Morgan, ’29, joined the
First National Bank in Memphis
soon after graduating in Lexing-

dent of the First National Bank of
Maryland.

ton. He devoted primary attention
to development of underwriting
business in state and local bonds,
and under his leadership the First
National Bank rose from a place of
small significance in investment
banking to become one of the larg-
est underwriters of municipal
bonds among all American banks.
Toa recent W&L senior who want-
ed to enter investment banking and
thought therefore he must go to
New York, Mr. Morgan said, “If
you're talking about state and lo-
cal bonds from the Mid-South, this
is the market.”

Mr. Morgan became a vice-presi-
dent of the Bank in 1937, at the

 

age of 28, and in 1960 he succeed-
ed another W&L man, Norfleet
Turner of: the Class. *of-.1924, as
president. Mr. ‘Turner, who has
many notable accomplishments, in-
cluding the presidency of the Na-
tional Bank Division of the Ameri-
can Bankers Association and mem-
bership on the Federal Advisory
Council of the Federal Reserve Sys-
tem, then became chairman of the
board. In addition to Messrs. Mor-
gan and Turner, the First National
Bank is served by five other Wash-
ington and Lee alumni; and Bay
Fitzhugh, a graduate of Vanderbilt
but son of the late ‘Tom Fitzhugh
of Washington and Lee’s Class of

1929, recently has been employed
by the bank as a trainee.

Just down the Valley in Roan-
oke, Edward H. Ould presides over
the First National Exchange Bank,
an institution that is virtually a
post-graduate division of the Un1-
versity. George I. Ellis, Jr., of the
Class of 1927, is a senior vice-presi-
dent and trust officer. William N.
Shearer, Jr., who took his law de-
gree in 1949, has just been promot-
ed to senior vice-president. John D.

a native of Rockbridge County, 1S
a senior vice-president who came
into the First National Exchange
organization through the merger of

Board, 1924-1927. Joining Mr.
Ould and Mr. Cocke on the Board
of Directors of the bank is John
D. Bassett, Jr., of W&L’s Class of
1924 and chairman of the board
of the Bassett Furniture Company,
world’s largest manufacturer of
wooden furniture.

For a W&L alumnus not a mem-
ber of the Class of 1929 to become
president of a hundred-million dol-
lar bank, it seems necessary for
him to have been a member of Phi
Beta Kappa—at least. The three
other presidents of banks in the big
300 achieved this distinction as un-
dergraduates, as did also the vale-
dictorian of the Class of 1914,
Arthur W. McCain, who as presi-
dent of the Chase National Bank in
the late 1940's was W&L’s “biggest”
bank president to date.

John Francis Watlington, Jr.,
valedictorian of the Class of 1938,
has been president of the Wacho-
via Bank and “Trust Company,
Winston-Salem, since 1956. The
Wachovia is the largest bank be-
tween Philadelphia and Dallas, and
it has long been regarded as one
of the most distinguished banks in
the nation. Mr. Watlington is the
principal of Dr. Gaines’ oft-told
story, “You'd better not hire him—

FALL 1963

 

JOHN F. WATLINGTON, JR., ’33

he'll take your job,” the obvious
conclusion to which is that he did.
Backing up Mr. Watlington are
fellow alumni A. R. Bennett, of the
Class of 1925, vice-president and
head of the trust department of
Wachovia at Durham; William G.
Sizemore, BS in Commerce 1948,
cashier of the banch at Asheville;
and John Schuber, Jr., BS in Com-
merce 1948 and LLB 1949 and an-
other member of the Class of ’44
whose degee was delayed by the
War, vice-president and trust of-
ficer of the important Charlotte of-
fice. Jack Schuber is also the im-
mediate past president of the Char-
lotte W&L Alumni Chapter.

Another vice-president of the
Wachovia Bank is Courtney R.
Mauzy, an alumnus of the Univer-
sity of Virginia but such a loyal
supporter of Washington and Lee
as to require inclusion here; Mr.
Mauzy achieved some legitimacy as
a W&L alumnus when he was ini-
tiated into the W&L chapter of
Beta Gamma Sigma in 1961, to-
gether with his splendid son,

Courtney, who was Tri-Captain of
the undefeated football team of
1960 and a magna cum laude BS in
Commerce in 1961.

Younger alumni are “maturing
through the ranks’’of the Wachovia
Bank. “He'll take your job” could
well be repeated as Royce Hough
joins the Wachovia this fall after
two years’ duty as an Army officer.
Royce was President of the Stu-
dent Body in 1958-59 and valedic-
torian of the Class of 1959, and af-
ter gracing W&L with a summa
cum laude BS in Commerce, he fin-
ished first in his class for the MBA
degree at Cornell University.

John Harold Hardwick, BA swm-
ma cum laude 1931, serves as presi-
dent and director of the Louisville
Trust Company, where he has the
pleasure of having as vice-president
and trust officer his classmate, Wil-
liam L. Jones. Vice-president and
trust officer of the rival Liberty
National Bank and Trust Com-
pany is another classmate, Sidney
W. Clay. In a rare coincidence, the
“Thirty-One Bankers in Louisville
were classmates again in the Har-
vard Business School, where all
three received MBA’s in 1933.
Rounding out a clean sweep by
Washington and Lee in Louisville’s
major banks are Charles H. Semple,
Jv., BS in Commerce 1939 and vice-
president of the Citizens Fidelity
Bank and ‘Trust Company; and A.
Stevens Miles, Jn, BA ros, re-
cently elevated to a vice-presidency
of the First National Lincoln Bank,
a bank which in a spirit that trans-
cends incongruity, advertises itself
as “The Oldest National Bank in
the South,’

‘Thomas C. Frost, Jv., whose 1950
BS in Commerce is another of the
bankers’ swmma cum laude degrees,
became president of a quarter-bil-
hon dollar bank, The Frost Nation-
al Bank of San Antonio, at an as-
tonishingly young age. He is re-
membered best in Lexington for
his remarkable performance as a
student and for his valedictory ad-

o>

dress. Mounting the platform to
deliver the oration he had submit-
ted dutifully for faculty approval,
he reports, “I looked out at my
classmates and decided I simply
couldn’t do that to them,’ where-
upon he pocketed the approved
text and produced some extempo-
raneous remarks that were highly
entertaining to the graduating sen-
iors, with only minor offense to the
delicate sensibilities of the faculty.

New York Banking

In the banking hub of the World,
W&L men find fellow alumni in all
the leading banks, with vice-presi-
dents in each of the six largest New
York banks, a senior vice-president
each in the First National City
Bank and the Manufacturers Han-
over ‘Trust Company, and some
forty alumni in all employed by
these half-dozen banking giants.

‘The Class of 1929 accomplished
this penetration almost within its
own number. Riley P. Stevenson is
a vice-president of the First Na-
tional City Bank, which recently
surpassed the Chase in total size.
Mr. Stevenson joined City Bank a
few weeks after his graduation, and
except for military service in 1942-
1946, his entire career has been
with this bank, where he now is
general credit supervisor for the
entire Metropolitan Division. A
senior vice-president of the First
National City Bank is Frank T.
“Pete” Mitchell, BA 1925, who after
living in Brazil for many years now
is responsible for all the very large
overseas operations of the bank.
Behind these two are a dozen other
alumni, ranging from Fred L.
Rush,, BA 1948 and LLB 1949,
who is a trust officer, to William P.
Boardman, BS in Commerce 1963
and vice-president of the Student
Body last year, who is a new
trainee. Another devoted alumnus,
W. J. L. Patton, BS in Commerce
1922, recently retired as deputy
comptroller of this ten-billion dol-
lar institution.

Kenneth A. Durham, who took

president of the Chemical Bank
New York ‘Trust Company, in

ham was an executive in the textile
industry until 1951, and he now
heads a banking office located in
the center of the primary textile
market, whose major customers are
firms in the textile industry. An-
other alumnus, Robert Van Buren,
BA 1950, was promoted last year
to a vice-presidency of the Chemi-
cal Bank. He and Mr. Durham
head the second largest W&L con-
tingent in New York Banking, a

state Southern District of its East-

taining correspondent relationships
with large Southern banks and de-
veloping new business in both
loans and trusts require him to
travel extensively, and he often

sees a number of his classmates, sev-
eral of them in line of duty.
Franklin Poore “Johnny” John-

to its merger with the Hanover
Bank. He resigned that position af-
ter twenty-four years in the bank
to re-enter the securities business,
with the firm of Cyrus J. Lawrence

last position of vice-president in
charge of public relations and busi-

It is necessary to move only one
class forward from 1929, to 1930, to
find a vice-president of the Chase
Manhattan Bank, Joseph C. Broad-
us, who is a specialist in the petrol-
eum division and another Harvard
MBA. ‘The Chase Manhattan
Bank’s petroleum department is
the largest of any bank in the
world, and Mr. Broadus frequent-
ly is called upon to travel to Vene-
zuela and the Near East, with oc-
casional trips to Europe. Since the
magnitude of some of the loans to
petroleum companies is beyond the
capacity of even the Chase, he of-
ten must deal with officers of the
other great banks, insurance com-
panies, and other financial insti-
tutions, to share these loans.

Moving back a short time, Wil-
liam A. McRitchie, LLB 1925, is
vice-president of the Morgan Guar-
anty Trust Company, where he has
been engaged in personal trust
work since 1928. Mr. McRitchie is
the sole alumnus in the Morgan
Guaranty bank, but its Board
Chairman, Henry Alexander
(called “the nation’s most prestig-
ious banker’ by Time magazine),
sent his son to Washington and
Lee, partly upon the recommenda-
tion of his good friend Norfleet
Turner and seconded by Allen
Morgan.

*Twenty-Nine Around the South

Washington and Lee has never
sought to develop men who func-

tions nor to imply that community
leadership is most admirable when
rendered in the national commun-
ity. Manifesting belief that leader-
ship is both worthy and personally
satisfying in every community are
“I'wenty-Nine_ Bankers _ scattered
through the larger South. Howard
W. Gwaltney is president and chair-
man of the board of the Bank of

president of two other business
firms; he also served the town as
Mayor for ten years. W. Van Gil-
bert, who went into the Law School
after three years and thereby delay-
ed his BS in Commerce until 1930,
is chairman of the board of the
First National Bank of Athens, Ala-
bama. McRee Davis serves as presi-
dent of the First National Bank of
Garland, Texas, which is affiliated
with the famed Republic National
Bank, of Dallas. Ernest Swope
Clarke, who entered W&L with the
Class of 1929 but earned his BS in
Commerce in 1928, has been for
many years president of the Citi-

stories tall, in time for celebration
of its centennial in 1965. Joining
Mr. Bacon on the bank’s board of
directors are Joseph R. Mighell, Jr.,
BS 1913 and chairman of the board
of the Mobile Steel Company, and
Robert E. Stevenson, BS 1927, vice-
president and also a director of the

Gulf, Mobile & Ohio Railroad. On
the other hand, Mr. Bacon’s ’I'wen-

board of the Merchants National
Bank of Mobile, his principal com-
petitor.

William 8B. Jacobs, another
“Twenty-Niner with a Harvard
MBA, has been for many years vice-
president and trust officer of the
Central National Bank, Richmond.
He is also director of several other
business firms, and he is unusually
active in administration of com-
munity affairs. In 1960, together
with Dean Lewis W. Adams of the
University’s School of Commerce
and Administration, he represented
Washington and Lee at a confer-
ence on Business Education, held

Outstanding Achievement

The banking industry is charac-
terized by men who put their roots
deep into a community and become
involved in its affairs. Except for
those members who are executives
in New York banks, the bankers of
the Class of 1929 are serving in or
near the same communities from
which they entered Washington
and Lee as students. From a class
which numbered only 110 when it
graduated from Washington and
Lee, the “Iwenty-Nine Bankers,
and the many other bankers who
are W&L alumni, by their achieve-
ments add great luster to the Uni-
versity. hey seem to justify Frank-
lin Johnson’s conclusion that “Dr.
Hancock, Dr. ‘Tucker, et al didn’t
do such a bad job after all for a
bunch of guys whose minds were
essentially centered on Sweet Briar
and Hollins.” .

Glee Club Production
Is Featured Attraction

Of 1963 Parents’ Weekend

ARENTS’ WEEKEND for 1963 was a record-setting affair at
Pp virtually every turn. While official attendance figures
differ little from last year’s all-time high, a number of
events on the busy weekend program attracted crowds of
students and their parents in unprecedented numbers.

With the football team away from town, the soccer game
between the Generals and King College was played on
Wilson Field, and a crowd of some 1,100 persons—the larg-
est ever to see a soccer contest at Washington and Lee—
cheered the home team to victory.

‘The Glee Club and Brass Choir concert which climaxed
the crowded Saturday schedule filled Doremus Gymnasium
with an audience estimated at some 1,300. Soloist with the
club was Miss Dorcas Campbell of nearby Fairfield, “Miss
Virginia” for 1963-64 and one of the ten “Miss America”
semi-finalists last September.

Some 1,070 parents and guests of 508 of Washington and
Lee’s students attended this year. ‘The Parents’ Advisory
Council, co-sponsor of the weekend with the University,

 

elected Houston attorney Durell Carothers as its 1964-65 Parents greet PRESIDENT COLE al reception
chairman.

in Evans Dining Hall.

Miss Dorcas Campbell, the current “Miss
Virginia,’ sang with the Glee Club at
Parents’ Weekend.

ASHINGTON AND LEE honored

it dedicated the Adrian L. Bend-

November.

Located in the University’s new
building for physics and_ biology,
the library is a gift of the family
and friends of the late Mr. Bend-
heim, a 1942 graduate.

During the brief public cere-
mony, Richard Bendheim of Rich-
mond, on behalf of the family and
friends, presented the University
with a portrait of the late Mr.
Bendheim to hang in the library.
Also participating in the dedica-

FALL 1963

tion were University President
Fred C. Cole, department head Dr.
Edward F. Turner, Jr., and Uni-
versity chaplain Dr. David W.
Sprunt.

In presenting the portrait of his
brother, Richard Bendheim said,
“Adrian graduated over twenty-one
years ago, but really only left this
fine University four and a_ half
years ago. I know in my own heart
that, next to his family and friends,
Washington and Lee was second to
none. His love and devotion to this
birthplace of leaders is in the rec-
ords and this everlasting memorial
to his memory is truly heartwarm-
ing to all of us.”

Prior to his death on July 25,

1959, Bendheim was active in alum-
ni leadership of the fund campaign
to provide improved facilities for
science instruction and research at
Washington and Lee. The new fa-
cilities realized through the cam-
paign were placed in service in
1962.

Bendheim, who was 37 when
struck and killed by lightning
while fishing at Virginia Beach,
was a former president of the Rich-
mond alumni chapter. He was ac-
tive in the real estate business, and
the Real Estate Board of Rich-
mond now awards the Adrian
Bendheim, Jr., Award annually to
the city’s outstanding real estate
salesman.

The Alumni Fund
For 1963-64 Will
Seek $165,000 Goal

The Alumni Fund Council’s
Chairman; Robert W.. Kime; “44,
Is Enthusiastic About Prospects

For Continued Dramatic Progress

N AN EFFORT to build success
I upon success, the Alumni Fund
Council has announced a goal of
$165,000 for the 1963-64 Alumni
Fund.

Some eighteen per cent greater
than the $140,832 total which
alumni contributed through last
year’s fund campaign, the new goal
reflects what the council’s mem-
bers believe is a realistic and chal-
lenging approach to alumni sup-
port of Washington and Lee.

In announcing new goals, Coun-
cil Chairman Robert W. Kime, ’51,
of Roanoke, said he was impressed
by the significant growth of the
Fund last year, and he expressed
confidence that alumni are being
caught up in a new spirit and new
interest that reflect not only pride
in their Alma Mater but also pride
in their potential to boost the Uni-
versity toward a promising future.

As in 1962-63, the emphasis dur-
ing the new Fund Year will be on
increased participation by former
students, Kime pointed out.

‘We stressed 100 per cent partici-
pation last year, and we are stress-
ing 100 per cent participation again
in the new campaign,’ he said. “We

<4

believe that this is the only goal
that suggests the importance of the
participation we seek.”

‘The increase in number of con-
tributors in 1962-63 over the pre-
vious year was dramatic — from
2,607 to 3,905. The latter figure
represents the largest number of
alumni ever to support Washington
and Lee through the Alumni
Fund’s annual effort.

“The support of last year’s rec-
ord-breaking Fund campaign was
inspiring to all of us who serve on
the Alumni Fund Council,” Kime
said. ““We know it was possible only
because so very many alumni, act-
ing as class and regional agents
and workers, gave so generously of
their time and energy. They should
be very proud of their achieve-
ments, as should all alumni.

Kime said the Council is confi-
dent that the new dollar goal for
the Fund can be attained, and that
there will be further progress to-
ward complete participation.

“We saw last year how much the
total amount can be influenced by
the addition of new contributors,’
he declared. “A great many persons
have increased the amounts of their

 

ROBERT W. KIME, 751

regular contributions, and this is
certainly commendable
tremely important, but the main
reason the Alumni Fund went
from $84,299 to $140,832 in one
year was the vital rise in the num-
ber of contributors.

“We are counting on everyone
who helped make last year’s efforts
so successful to continue and_ in-
crease, where possible, their sup-
port,” Kime said. “But we are also
counting on a great many other
alumni to renew their active par-
ticipation in their University’s
future.’

The number of alumni who con-
tributed to the 1962-63 Fund rep-
resents about thirty-six per cent of
the alumni carried on the rolls of
the Alumni Association. Compari-
son of this percentage with other
schools in general reflects favor-
ably on the University, but the
achievements of schools like Dart-
mouth, Duke, Davidson, Amherst,
Williams, Vanderbilt, Princeton,
Bowdoin, and Yale inspires mem-
bers of the Fund Council to seek
a place for Washington and Lee in
the American Alumni Council's
“honor roll” of alumni giving.

Sy

Pride and Enthusiasm Bring
Unprecedented Results
For 1962-63 Alumni Fund

Donald M. Fergusson, 51

Fund Council Chairman, Tells
Of Successful Efforts To Win
Greater Alumni Participation

OR THE FIRST time in several years, a full report on
F the annual Alumni Fund is made available to all
alumni in the pages of the Alumni Magazine. The
purpose of this report is to recognize publicly in a
small way those loyal alumni who responded to the
appeal for support of the University through the 1962-
63 Alumni Fund.

In every way, the 1962-63 Fund was a record-break-

er. The final total of $140,832 surpassed by more than, |
$27,000 the previous record high of $113,682 in 1957- is

58. This money represents a significant increase in the
resources of Washington and Lee, resources that have
sometimes been referred to in Fund appeals as ‘“‘bread
and butter’ dollars for the week to week and month
to month conduct of the University’s program in high-
er education. Washington and Lee is definitely a
stronger institution in 1963-64 because of this un-
paralleled support of alumni in 1962-63.

But as important as the dollar total is to the on-

er

going work of Washington and Lee, the most signi-
ficant aspect of the 1962-63 Fund was the growth of
participation among the University’s former students.
A final count of 3,905 alumni contributed to the 1962-
63 Alumni Fund, 527 more than those who helped
make 1957-58 the previous banner year. Last year’s
total was nearly 1,300 above the number of contri-
butors in 1961-62. All of this, the Alumni Fund Coun-
cil believes, points up a new spirit of participation on

FALL 1963

 

the part of alumni, a spirit that recognizes the value
of Washington and Lee’s contribution to the lives
and careers of individual alumni, and a spirit that
acknowledges the worthwhile influence that the Uni-
versity will exert on future Washington and Lee men
and higher education in general.

‘The emphasis of this report, then, is not upon how
much an individual or class contributed. The empha-
sis is upon the very important fact that they did give
through the Fund. Except for proper recognition of
the topmost classes, the amounts are not recorded, but
the name of every participant is listed in grateful ac-
knowledgment of his vital support.

It should be pointed out with great emphasis that
while this report is a complete listing of all those who
gave through the annual Alumni Fund, it is not a
complete recording of all support rendered the Uni-
versity by former students. Some prefer to make di-
rect gifts, outside the annual fund, that support spe-
cial scholarship or other endowments; some whose
sons are students contribute through the annual Par-
ents’ Fund; others are completing their pledges to the
University Development Program. All such gifts are
important to Washington and Lee and its future. This
report, however, lists only those alumni whose gifts
through the Alumni Fund helped build the record to-
tal of $140,832 and the record participation of 3,905
contributors. This is the Alumni Fund Honor Roll

for 1962-63. (See the following pages.)

Homecoming Weekend Attracts Many
For Lee Chapel Visit, Football Contest

T WAS A winning combination
I that greeted the returning
alumni on October 12th. The
weather was perfect, the warm fel-
lowship characteristic of all Wash-
ington and Lee gatherings was
much in evidence, and the Gener-
als trounced Centre College, 28-6,
in the traditional football game.
Altogether, it was a successful
Homecoming.

The Alumni Board of ‘Trustees
arrived Friday, and as representa-
tives of all alumni, the Board mem-
bers attended the rededication cere-
mony at Lee Chapel. The Board
meeting took place Friday evening
when, among other business, the
members approved the 1963-64
Alumni Fund goals and the final
plans for a new Alumni Directory.

There is no accurate method for
“clocking” attendance at Home-
coming. Practiced observers  esti-
mated a larger crowd than in the
past few years, but there are no ad-
vance reservations recorded, and
not everyone who attends the foot-
ball game or other events finds time
to sign the registration book or to
get to the luncheon in Evans Hall.
However, these functions can serve

as indicators. ‘This year 177 alumni.

registered as compared with 144
last year, and 497 guests were
served at lunch as compared with
430 in 1962.

Saturday morning alumnzi stroll-
ed the campus and visited the re-
stored Lee Chapel where a morning
coffee for alumni and their famil-
ies was held in the Chapel Mus-
eum. This occasion gave alumni an
Opportunity to see the extensive
remodeling that has been done dur-

36

 

Mr. and Mrs. JOHN R. HANDLAN, ‘04, rest in the Lee Chapel Museum before the portrait

of George Washington Custis Lee, whose administration nearly overlapped Mr. Hanp-

LAN’s days as a student. Mr. HANDLAN, who is 81, made the journey from Belle Vernon,
Pa., driving his own automobile.

ing the last fifteen months and to
enjoy the excellent new arrange-
ment of the museum material in
modern, well-lit display cabinets.
‘The new science building and the
remodeled Howe Hall were points
of much interest to former students
who did not attend Homecoming
in 1962. Returning alumni seemed
impressed with campus vitality and
development.

The football game brought on
the customary color and excite-
ment. An excellent band from
Halifax High School provided en-
tertainment at half-time when can-
didates for the Homecoming Queen
were presented. ‘The crown went to
Miss Carol Bruce, a senior at Ste-
phens College who was escorted by
Jimmy deYoung, president of Phi
Kappa Sigma.

her escort, Jim DEYouNG, of
Kenilworth, Ill.

Following the game a reception
was held in Evans Hall where many
alumni and guests had a chance to
talk with the coaching staff and
members of the football team. ‘The
coffee, sandwiches, and punch
served were especially enjoyed by
alumni who had brought their
youngsters to visit the Lee Chapel.

With their usual fine hospitality,
the fraternities extended an enthu-
slastic welcome to alumni members
and friends. One usual student and
fraternity Homecoming activity
was suspended for this year only.
The faculty alumni committee,
seeking to emphasize the dignity
and solemnity of the Lee Chapel
rededication, requested fraterni-
ties to leave their houses undec-
orated, and all chapters cooperated
in this gesture.

Alumni Board Gives Approval

For Publication of New

Directory of Former Students

Careful Effort Will Be Made

To Provide Complete and Accurate

Listings by Alphabetical, Class,

And Geographical Categories

ITH THE APPROVAL of the

Alumni Board of Trustees, a
new Alumni Directory is being pre-
pared by the central Alumni Office.
It has been fifteen years since the
last directory publication in 1949,
and the Board considered the need
for an up-to-date reference volume
as both obvious and urgent.

Plans call for a _paper-bound
volume approximately 6x8 inches,
containing approximatey 390 pages,
and costing about $2.00 each to
produce.

The book will have three main
divisions:

(A) An alphabetical listing of all
alumni, living and deceased:
This section will designate
deceased alumni by an aster-
isk and indicate his class. En-
tries for each living alumnus
will include full name, class,
degree at Washington and
Lee, years of attendance, ad-
dress, and occupation (if
known). An alumnus whose
address is not known will be
listed as ‘“unlocated.”’

(B) A class listing: This section
will list each class’s alumni al-
phabetically by last name and
initials. The section will
be further subdivided into
law graduates; law non-grad-
uates; academic school grad-
uates, and academic. school
non-graduates.

(C) A geographical listing: ‘This
38

section will list alumni by last
names and initials, according
to their state and city resi-
dences. All lists will be al-
phabetical.

Such an undertaking is, at best,
a tremendously complicated and
tedious operation. It requires an in-
finite attention to detail, and ex-
treme care will be exercised to
keep possible errors in listing at an
absolute minimum. The central
ofhce in Lexington will need the
cooperation of every alumnus in
this project.

Before you put this magazine
down please carry out the follow-
ing simple instructions:

1. First observe the form at the
end of this article.

2. Now check your address on
this magazine. This is the ad-
dress that will be shown in the

alphabetical section. If it is
incorrect, please make the
proper entry on the form.

3. Consider your occupation.

(a) if you have not submitted
an occupational file ques-
tionnaire or if your occupa-
tion has changed, enter on
the form a one or two word
description of your occupa-
tion—such as lawyer, doc-
tor, farmer, banker, insur-
ance salesman, real estate,
etc. If retired, indicate your
last Occupation prior to re-
tirement.

4. Clip out the form and mail it
to the Alumni Office in Lexington.

You can also help with the “lost”
alumni. On pages 39-41 of this
magazine you will find a list of al-
umni, by class, whose addresses in
the alumni records are not correct.
Look particularly at your class-
mates’ names. You may notice some-
one you recognize as living in your
home town or area. If you are cer-
tain of a correct address for him,
please advise the Alumni Office at
once.

‘The completed directories will
be distributed gratis to those alum-
ni and friends who have manifest-
ed an interest in Washington and
Lee and those who have contribut-
ed to the University’s progress and
development.

With your help, a complete and
accurate directory will be possible.

PRESIDENT BATTLE

 

VICE-PRESIDENT BRYANT

 

“TREASURER WISDOM

Association’s Officers for 1963-64 Have

Varied Careers, Hobbies, Civic Interests

JouN D. Barr_e, JR., President

Fellow of the American College of Physicians and
Diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medi-
cine, Dr. John D. Battle, Jr., is head of the Depart-
ment of Hematology of the Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic.
In 1962 he was President of the Ohio Society of In-
ternal Medicine. This distinguished career in medi-
cine, with the accompanying demands upon time and
energy, does not prevent Dr. Battle from engaging
in tennis several times a week, from figure skating in
the winter, and from avidly studying the American
Revolution—the latter undertaken “when the weather
is really bad.”

THOMAS B. BRYANT, JR., Vice-President

T. B. Bryant, Jr., has practiced law in Orangeburg,
South Carolina, continuously since he received his
law degree from Washington and Lee in 1928. He
served the State of South Carolina in the House of
Representatives in 1931-32 and in the State Senate
from 1944-52. Prior to his election as Senator, Mr.
Bryant was Judge of the Orangeburg City Court. He is
a director of the Wannamaker Chemical Company, a
trustee of Coker College, and has served on the board
of the Connie Maxwell Children’s Home (Baptist) for

42

twenty years. For the past ten years he has served as
chairman of the South Carolina Probation, Parole and
Pardon Board.

WILLIAM B. Wispom, Treasurer

A life-time vocation in advertising and public re-
lations apparently has contributed to a variety of avo-
cations for William B. Wisdom of New Orleans. He re-
tired from his self-owned and operated agency after
twenty-seven years and is now connected with General
Enterprises, Inc., owners of ‘The California Oil Com-
pany Building. Mr. Wisdom possesses all of “Thomas
Wolfe’s manuscripts and hundreds of Wolfe’s letters,
and he also has complete first-edition collections of
A. C. Doyle’s Holmes, Faulkner, Saroyan, and many
modern authors. He gave his complete and exhaustive
collection of Huey P. Long material to Tulane Uni-
versity, and his Wolfe collection is deposited at Har-
vard. He is a board member of the New Orleans Pub-
lic Library, Dillard University, the Louisiana Histori-
cal Museum, the Ochsner Foundation Hospital, the
Rosa Mary Foundation, the Fidelis Foundation, and
the Greater New Orleans Incorporated. He is also a
member of the Board of the Ear, Eye, Nose, and
Throat Hospital in New Orleans.

CLASS Notes

1890

A former state senator, F. M. Hupson,
who still puts in five hours a day at his law
firm’s office in Miami, was honored at a
