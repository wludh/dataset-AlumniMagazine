For many students, this....

attracted attention by their unique
or rare occurrence, or from gradual
but real changes in attitudes from
one student generation to another.

‘This September, the concern was
expressed by the University’s pres-
ident himself. He took the occasion
of the opening assembly of a new
school year to make what amounted
to an official expression of the Uni-
versity’s attitude toward traditions
that have always been considered
the welcomed responsibility of
Washington and Lee students.

No infrequent isolated depar-
ture from customary practices of
dress and courtesy prompted Presi-
dent Cole to speak out in a strong
challenge to student pride and self-
respect. Instead, his remarks grew
out of a growing anxiety among
many members of the University
family that a sharp change in stu-
dent attitude was in progress, and
that a serious deterioration of
worthwhile student tradition was
imminent.

Evidences of some kind of change

FALL 1965

going on were plainly visible. No
longer were there unusual. shirt-
sleeve exceptions to a_ jacketed
rule. ‘Iwo or three years ago some
students started carrying their coats,
hung casually over one shoulder
on the crook of a finger. Then, as
others picked up the habit, some
would carry their coats onto the
campus, deposit them on coathooks
and make their class rounds with-
out them. Others found it even
more convenient not to bring them
at all.

Still, perhaps more students were
wearing their coats than those who
were carrying them or without
them. But the usual processes of the
assimilation committee seemed. in-
effective or non-existent.

Then, during the 1964-65 school
year, a kind of dialogue wore on
through the pages of the Ring-tum
Phi, a dialogue that centered not
so much on whether a_= student
should wear a coat and tie or not,
but rather on whether or not the
Assimilation Committee should try

vss has given way to this,

to enforce conventional dress. A
student referendum was held in
December, an inconclusive vote in
which students were offered four
ways in which to mark their bal-
lots:

1. “I agree with the tradition
of conventional dress and the
Assimilation Committee as it
now stands.”

2. “I agree with the tradition
of conventional dress and
the Assimilation Committee,
but I believe that . there
should be some change in
the present operation of the
committee.”

3. “I believe in the tradition of
conventional dress, but I
do not believe it should be
administered by an assimila-
tion committee.”

4. “I do not believe in the tra-
dition of conventional dress.”’

A shirt-sleeved student body gath-
ered in Evans Hall to hear Prest-
DENT COLE’s address at the opening
assembly. The temperature was in
ihe nineties, and it was stuffy in the
assembly hall, a fact attested to by
numerous professors who wore
heavy academic robes as well as
coats and ties,

FALL 1965

no matter what academic degrees or courses were offered here when they were
students, no matter how large the student body was at the time, no matter who
was president, dean, or professor. The pamphlet called this kind of continu-
ity a “unity of spirit” among alumni, a unity of spirit that grows out of shar-
ing these values and attitudes, a unity of respect that lasts throughout lifetimes.

If you will, let me mention some of the things that generations of Wash-
ington and Lee men possess in common.

One is the shared experience of studying at a college where the student
is treated as an individual, where the academic success or failure of every
student has always been a matter of individual concern on the parts of profes-
sors, deans, and other counselors.

Another is the shared experience of association with a faculty of dedicated
teachers—men who recognize the value of undergraduate education, its spe-
cial significance, its special joys and rewards; men who have devoted their pro-
fessional lives to this kind of teaching.

And there is the shared experience of living and studying together in an
atmosphere of complete trust and respect, where the honesty and integrity of
every individual is honored by every other individual.

Still another is the shared experience of friendly association with your
fellow students and with your professors, the memory of life in a community
where it was easy to be courteous and friendly to others, for others were in-
clined to be courteous and friendly to you.

And, finally for this summary, there is the shared experience of pride in
your University and pride in yourself as a member of its student body. There
is a pride among Washington and Lee men that they availed themselves of
the educational opportunity here, a pride that they accepted and helped pre-
serve principles of honor and integrity, and a pride that they accepted and
preserved certain conditions of courtesy and friendliness and certain condi-
tions of gentlemanly dress. ‘There has been a characteristic pride among Wash-
ington and Lee men that causes the most uninformed stranger to this campus
to sense there 1s something different, something special about their institution,

 

 

 

A current fad among students is to
go sockless, although some will ad-
mit it makes for sore feet. Some
students don’t abandon their coats
entirely, choosing instead to hook
them over their shoulders as a cas-
ual gesture toward conventional
dress,

perhaps because of the way the students greet him and each other on the
walks, perhaps in the way the students seem to take pride in their personal
appearance.

I wonder how may of you share this pride. I wonder, because there 1s
reason to believe that some of you do not.

The freshmen among you recently returned from the orientation lectures
and discussions of freshman camp. Various speakers and counselors there told
these new students a great many things of great value. Freshmen were told
that a Washington and Lee man doesn’t lie, cheat, or steal. ‘hey were told
that a Washington and Lee man customarily speaks to fellow students and
others he may meet on the campus walks. They were told that a Washington
and Lee man wears a coat and tie.

It doesn’t take long to discover that some Washington and Lee men do
not speak to each other on the campus-walks now. And if the same conditions
of dress prevail this year that did last April and May, then the freshman very
quickly will feel that his expenditures on jackets and ties could have been
invested more wisely in other ways.

How can you tell a freshman that he must speak to his fellow students, if
practically no one speaks to him; how can you tell him he must dress like
a gentleman, yet he sees numbers of upperclassmen without coats, without
socks, some with shirttails out, collars open and ties dangling, or with no ties
at all?

As you know, I am not a graduate of Washington and Lee. My experience
as a student and teacher and administrator, before coming to this campus, was
at large universities where there was not as much concern for campus courtesy,
or with the way students dressed. ‘Therefore, I believe my impressions as to the
value of your student traditions are as objective as anyone’s.

Last spring the self-study committee raised many questions. Just how im-
portant is it, anyway, for our students to speak on the campus, or to wear
coats and ties? What has all this to do with education anyhow? Are these tra-
ditions worth preserving? Why should Washington and Lee wish to be dif-

ferent? Why should Washington and Lee students be expected to dress dif-
ferently, or be any more courteous than any other college students?

We talked about these matters at great length. We discussed the very real
concern of many alumni and admirers of the University that the traditions
are vanishing. I can tell you something of my own knowledge of alumni atti-
tudes on this matter, for I have had voluminous correspondence with many,
and long conversations with others. They simply can’t understand why you
would allow to be weakened those concepts and practices in which they
took such pride as students, and in which they still take pride as alumni. They
look about them, and they don’t like what they see. They say to me, “What
are you going to do about it?” If I say that matters of student courtesy and
dress are not subject to University rules and regulations, but rather the
province of student self-government and custom, then some of these alumni
say it is time the University made it a matter of administrative rules and
regulations.

Well, I for one am not convinced that this is an answer, and I feel the
alumni who suggest this would agree in a moment of reflective judgment. I am
certain that a great many of my faculty associates agree. No professor wants
to become a policeman for enforcing student dress any more than he wants
to become a judge in administering the honor system.

In the course of our Self-Study Committee discussion, some conclusions
were reached. While it was argued by some that wearing a coat and tie will
not directly help a student to increase his knowledge, it was agreed that gen-
tlemanly dress can contribute or enhance in the individual a measure of self-
pride, self-respect, and self-discipline—all factors that could have some rela-
tionship to pride and self-discipline in academic matters. And, it was agreed
that the values attached to student tradition by many thousands of alumni,
parents, and friends cannot be dismissed lightly.

So, the question came to a focus. “What, if anything, can be done to re-
verse the trend, to save the traditions?” Jim Kulp, last year’s student body
president, felt that the Executive Committee’s amendments of the procedures

 

“I

 

 

 

 

 

In early May, the warmer weather
caused even more coats to be shed.

Many students continued to wear

conventional dress, but there were
limes, such as these scenes, when it
seemed the student in a coat was
the exception to a shirtsleeve rule.

of the Assimilation Committee were a step in the right direction, but he agreed
that more should be done. He joined in a recommendation by others present
that it might serve a useful purpose if the University’s attitude on the matter
be made known to you, the students. It was suggested that the president of
the University, insofar as he could do so, express this attitude in his remarks
before the opening assembly in the Fall. I am carrying out that suggestion
at this moment.

Because I believe personally in the importance of your student traditions,
and because I am aware of the importance that so many others attach to these
traditions, I am making this appeal to you now. I ask you to consider seriously
and thoughtfully your attitudes toward these customs, and to consider the
value that you attach to them.

Review the sacrifices you would seem to make in terms of personal inde-
pendence and your freedom of thought and action.

Consider the responsibility you tacitly accepted when you chose Washing-
ton and Lee as your college.

Think about your role in the preservation of certain values and attitudes
that have been and continue to be important to men who have preceded you
here.

Ponder your right to destroy and maim that which many others before
you sustained with pride and dignity.

Decide if you wish to share in a unity of spirit with other Washington and
Lee men of many generations, or decide if you are going to hold in contempt
or in apathetic indifference this bond of fellowship.

Weigh carefully your obligation to give something of yourself to this Uni-
versity, as well as your privilege to take a part of it with you.

And when you have thought of these things, when you have made up your
mind, then I hope that you, too, will feel the same pride in your University,
and the same pride in yourself as a student here, that so many others before
you have felt.

I wish you good fortune for the coming year.

Best Orientation Method
For Washington and Lee

RESHMEN CAMP—alter thirty-four
k sessions since its beginning in
1g28—continues to provide Wash-
ington and Lee with the best ap-
proach to freshman orientation at
both academic and extra-curricular
levels.

This September, all but a hand-
ful of the 347-member freshman
class piled aboard school buses and
traveled to Natural Bridge for a
three-day program of lectures, bull
sessions, and recreation.

Each year there seems to be more
to cover, particularly in the extra-
curricular categories where new
student activities want an oppor-
tunity to make their pitch to the
new men as early as possible.

Kreshmen still get academic ad-

vice from. deans, professors, and
carefully-selected student counsel-
ors. Student government represen-
tatives talk about student tradi-
tions and responsibilities, and ath-
letic coaches appeal for freshman
participation. Interest perks up
most when fraternities are the topic,
and some of the most effective or-
ientation still takes place in the
small group conferences that are
more question and answer than
formal lecture.

As a final touch, campers hear
excellent talks by a current stu-
dent and an what

m WILLIAM A. NOELL, JR., 64, was president of the student body

his senior year, a champion debater, a member of Phi Beta
Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa, and a Fulbright Scholar.
In September of 1963 and again this past September, he ad-
dressed the new freshmen in the closing assembly at Freshman
Camp. For those who heard him, his comments on what Wash-
ington and Lee can mean to a young man were the highlight
of the camp experience. Noell spent last year in Europe on his
Fulbright grant, and he is currently a first year law student at
the University of Virginia. Excerpts from his talk:

“To be perfectly frank, gentlemen, you

did not decide to go to Berkeley, you

go to Yale, you did

not decide to go to Harvard or to Prince-

did not decide to

ton, You decided to come to Washington
and Lee. We ask you, then, to feel pride
because that choice is your own. And,
further, we ask you to give demonstrable
evidence of that pride. We ask you to
show some respect for this institution
which, after all, is your own.”

“Generations of students have been
writing prologue for Washington and Lee.
You have been asked to continue that
job. Do not, for one moment, forget that
what you do and say in the next four
years is what Washington and Lee is do-
ing and saying in the next four years. Do
not forget that Washington and Lee will
be as active as you are active, as com-

FALL 1965

placent as you are complacent, as fine as
you are fine, as noble as you are noble, as
rare as you are rave....Nor should you
make any mistake about the fact that
what you will write on that prologue is
absolutely indelible. Yours is not the
right, yours is not the privilege of era-
sure .... What you do here stays.”

* * *

“You had an option as to whether or
not you would come to Washington and
Lee. You knew of certain advantages that
it boasted. Your responsibility, then, is to
leave that option open to others. Do not
forget that strengthening and maintenance
of what exists is a positive, not a negative,
force of action,”

* * *

“Tt is no excuse for you lo say, once
you have reached the Washington and

 

Lee campus, thal there are certain up-

perclassmen who do not set a reasonable
example for you to follow. For these are
men who do not have the courage or the
strength to assume the responsibility that
is. theirs. The responsibility is clearly
yours. If examples are not set, it is up to
you to set them. But do not believe for a
moment that you may shirk responsibility
because someone else has failed to assume
it. Never make that mistake.”

* * *

“Gentlemen, what we today hand to you
has taken not a lifetime but lifetimes to
build. That responsibility should weigh
heavily on your shoulders. I hope it will.
Study the past, remember the past 4s
prologue, understand fully what is meant
when someone tells you that privilege is
indeed a responsibility. Then maybe you
will begin to grasp what Washington and
Lee is all about.”

“Citius, Altius, Fortius”

# OF ALL THE TALKS heard by freshmen at camp, one of the most likely
to be long-remembered is the annual sales pitch made by Physical Educa-
tion Director Norm Lord as he introduces the various members of the
intercollegiate coaching staff. It is unlikely that in their seventeen or
eighteen years many freshmen have encountered a person with Coach
Lord’s enthusiasm for physical activity. For alumni of the past fifteen
years, these shots should recall those memorable freshman days when they

 

were exhorted to become, as Coach Lord puts it, “citvus, altius, fortius!”

“Hello, troops, welcome to the
muscle factory!”

          

“Tf your body's warm, we want “We dowt care if you can't Jump ‘Yowre going to learn to jump a

New Troub Director
Says Drama Should

Entertain and Teach

® FOR LEONEL L. (Lee) Kahn, Jr.,
Washington and Lee’s new drama
director, a college theater should
both entertain and educate.

Kahn says the educational thea-

‘

ter (he prefers that term to “college
theater’) has two purposes:

“First, it should present as many
forms and styles of dramatic litera-
ture and theatrical production as
possible so the students, over their
four years here, can see many dif-
ferent kinds of theater.

“Secondly, for those students in-
terested in the theater as perhaps a
livelihood, it should offer the nec-
essary training and background so
they can get into graduate school.|

“I’m speaking of those interested
in the theater as a career, or who
want to teach drama, or even those
who just want to take part in their
neighborhood theater groups at
home.

“In an extracurricular theater,
you can improvise and ‘make do,’ ”’
Kahn added, “but when you start
training people for graduate work,
you need the best equipment pos-
sible.”

At the moment, Kahn and the
Washington and Lee drama group,
the ‘froubadours, are ‘making do.’
But they also made some perma-
nent improvements to the ‘Trouba-
dour ‘Theater on N. Main St., in
preparation for their first produc-
tion of the season, Samuel Beckett’s
“Waiting for Godot.”

‘The interior of the theater has

14

been completely repainted, and uni-
versity carpenters are constructing
a 15-foot circular revolving stage.

The revolving stage, to be used
for the first time in the production
of Shakespeare’s “Richard II” next
March, helps alleviate a space prob-
lem and will permit set changes
not possible before.

‘The theater seats have been re-
paired—at a cost of five seats. Re-
pair parts being unavailable else-
where, it was necessary to use the
five seats to patch the others. As
a result, the theater now seats 160
compared to the previous 165.

“The theater is pretty good so
far as the audience’s being able to

see the stage is concerned,” Kahn
said. “I would never want a theater
seating more than g00—the people
would be too far away from. the
actors. Acoustics leave a little to
be desired.”

Kahn also hopes to get a new
dimmer for the stage lights. “The
present one is just not efficient,” he
said.

Most of the ‘Troubadours are in-
terested in the theater strictly as an
extracurricular activity. But several
want to go on to graduate school in
the art.

The 31-year-old Kahn is a native
of Louisiana and received his bach-
elor of arts and master of fine arts
degrees from ‘Tulane. He is current-
ly working toward his Ph.D. degree
from ‘Tulane.

Before coming to Washington
and Lee, he directed the theater at
Delta State College in Mississippi
and has worked as a producer and
director in summer theaters in
North Carolina and New Orleans.
He and his wife have three child-
ren.

Kahn replaced Dr. Cecil D.

Jones, who resigned as drama di-

rector to accept a similar position
at Vanderbilt University, his alma
mater.

 

Director Ler KAHN, right, rehearses a scene from his first’ Troubadour production,
“Wailing for Godot,” The difficult play drew high praise for ils performances and
staging.

Campus Events Are Many and Varied

= THE CAMPUS seemed an unusually
busy place this fall. Here are some
of the things that made it seem that
way:

Three lectures by the Univer-
sity’s Glasgow Visiting Professor,
author David Stacton, who spoke
on “Advice to a Young Novelist,”
“How Writing Gets Written,” and
“The Uses of History.” A fourth
public appearance of Stacton will
feature a reading from his work.

A visit to the University by Dr.
Fritz Machlup, professor of eco-
nomics and international finance at
Princeton and one of the nation’s
leading experts. Dr.
Machlup spoke in Lee Chapel on

economics

 

PROF. PAXTON DAvis with Mr. and Mrs. REED
SARRATT, JR.

the Choice of
and also met with vari-

“Liberalism and
Freedoms,”
ous economics classes over a two-
day period. A past president of the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors, Dr. Machlup spoke
at a dinner meeting of the local
branch.

Two outstanding art exhibits in
duPont Hall’s gallery, one by Vir-
ginia Beach artist Walter Thrift,
the other by the University’s own
artist in residence, Ray Prohaska.
Thrift’s paintings were on display
in October, and Prohaska’s in No-
vember. Both drew many viewers.

Concerts by pianist Stephen
Manes, violinist Charles Castleman,

FALL 1965

and the lowa String Quartet, all of
the programs part of the Concert
Guild series. ‘The series is available
to all students this year through
memberships covered by the Uni-
versity’s new comprehensive fee.
Three Lee Chapel lectures by the
Canon of Birmingham Cathedral
and rector of Birmingham, Eng-
land, Bryan Green. Considered the
outstanding speaker in the Church
of England, Canon Green attract-
ed near capacity audiences both at
Washington and Lee and at VMI
during an intensive speaking en-
gagement in early November. In
addition to the public lectures, he
talked to various faculty and _ stu-

 

EDWIN D. CANHAM

dent groups at both institutions.
An influx of visitors to the De-
partment of Journalism and Com-
munications. Edwin D. Canham,
editor-in-chief of the Christian Sci-
ence Monitor, spoke on “Who is
Winning the Worldwide Struggle
for the Minds of Men?” ina public
lecture. A. Reed Sarratt, Jr., form-
er executive director of the South-
ern Education Reporting Service
in Nashville, spoke on “Civil
Rights and the Press of the South.”
Robert Estabrook, associate editor
of the Washington Post, just back
from four years as the Post’s chief
foreign correspondent in Europe,
talked on ‘““The Mood of Europe:

Politics and Press.’ Paul Herron,
editor of the Post’s “Potomac Mag-
azine’ visited the department,
spoke with members of Sigma Delta
Chi, the journalism fraternity, and
then wrote a feature article for his
magazine on journalism education
at Washington and Lee.

A presentation of unique color
slides of 13th Century miniatures
by University of North Carolina
Spanish professor, John E. Keller,
who also spoke on “Canticles of
Our Lady,” Dr. Keller‘s comments
and the slide presentation offered
an unusual composite view of me-
dieval life.

A concert by the combined glee

clubs of Washington and Lee and
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College
with the John A. Graham Brass
Choir in Lee Chapel. The singers
occupied the balconies, the brass
choir the stage, and the audience
was treated to an unusual “stereo”
effect in the special programming
planned by Robert Stewart, the
University’s director of music.

More lectures, these by Kurt von
Schuschnigg, the former head of
the Austrian government who re-
fused to give in to Hitler in 1938
and was imprisoned; and by Dr. E.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

Conventional Dress
(Continued from page 9)
pected the usual remarks from the
president at the start of a new year,
and some dozed as President Cole
led into the meat of his address.
Then, almost suddenly, he was talk-
ing to the students in a way they
had never heard before. And, with
very few exceptions, they listened.

When it was over, after President
Cole had challenged each of them
in terms of personal responsibility
and pride, they applauded. For a
one young man
stood, but he was soon joined by
others until the entire student
body was on its feet in an apparent
afhrmative response to the Presi-
dent’s appeal in behalf of student
tradition.

As they filed out into the hot
afternoon sun, some still carried
their coats, but many, perhaps a
little self-consciously, slipped them
on. The next day, despite con-
tinued go-degree weather, the coats
were definitely back in the majority
again, and as the spirit of President
Cole’s remarks prevailed, the coat-
less again became the campus ex-
ception.

The Ring-tum Phi editorial col-
umns welcomed the renewal of em-
phasis on student tradition, al-
though some columnists took ex-
pected pot shots at the assembly
speech. But, in the main, for the
time being at least, the President’s
statement of University attitude to-
ward student tradition had had its
desired effect.

Students and professors alike will
comment on the improvement this
fall in the general adherence to
conventional dress. It has been a
long, mild autumn, with little cause
for students to retreat into topcoats.
The cover photograph of this issue
was taken in mid-November at a
typical class break. One or two
shirt-sleeved students are visible,
but there’s little resemblance be-
tween this photo and the ones ap-
pearing on Page 8, also shot dur-

moment,

only

FALL 1965

ing a normal class break in carly
May.

Will this new, revitalized, posi-
tive attitude prevail next spring?
Maybe so, maybe not.

About the only thing going for
conventional dress is the spirit of
President Cole’s challenge to the
students, an assurance that student
traditions are more than superficial
in the fibre of Washington and
Lee’s educational experience. Tra-
dition for tradition’s sake appears

to have little appeal to students of

the mid-1960’s.

On the other hand, there are a
number of factors that could con-
tinue to work against conventional
dress as known and respected by
generations of alumni.

There is a trend toward more
casual dress, among persons of all
ages as well as students. Conven-
tional dress is now limited just to
the campus, not to Lexington, as
students today prefer to don casual
attire for off-campus living. There
will be inevitable spill-over onto
the campus.

There is no longer a_ general,
whole-hearted endorsement and
support of student conventional
dress among members of the facul-
ty. As the faculty, as part of a na-
tional trend, becomes more mobile,
and as older professors retire, few
new men willingly undertake to
encourage conventional dress, and
some frankly attach no importance
to it. Their backgrounds, perhaps,
were at colleges where few students
wore coats or ties, so even a fifty-
fifty ratio at Washington and Lee
smacks of formality, pleasant or
otherwise, to them.

Students will continue to reflect
confused attitudes toward conven-
tional dress and other student tra-
ditions. For a student who, chances
are, isn’t very friendly to his next
door neighbor back home, it will
become increasingly difficult to
expect him to speak cordially with
total strangers on the campus walks.
Students generally want to con-

form, to be accepted, and some will
wear coats and ties to conform at
Washington and Lee, while others
will cast them aside in order to con-
form with the national image of the
college man.

‘The Washington and Lee student
body remains essentially conserva-
tive in its political, economic, and
social attitudes. Yet, many seem to
feel they should be more rebellious
one way or another. Some will
choose to attack conventional dress.
After all, it’s easier and safer to
hate your coat than a Communist
or a Bircher or whatever.

It's possible to get a good college
education wearing a T-shirt and a
pair of blue jeans. Despite some
important “carry-over” effects in
terms of self-discipline and _ self-
respect, conventional dress really
doesn’t have much educational
value. At least, it wouldn’t have on
most campuses.

But, then—if we who are alumni
can believe what we feel as a re-
sult of our years here—Washington
and Lee is different from most
campuses.

Conventional dress is, if nothing
else, a symbol. It is a symbol of a
young man’s acceptance of a way
of student life that is distinctive in
the premium it places upon indi-
vidual honor and integrity and in-
dividual responsibility. Such a
symbol, then, becomes to most of
us an integral part of our Wash-
ington and Lee experience, and we
want others who follow to respect
and accept this symbol, too.

More than one person close to
the University has concluded that
the real danger from a deteriora-
tion of student tradition is its chain
reaction effect. It has been said that
the demise of the speaking tradi-
tion will bring about the end of
conventional dress, and the end of
conventional dress will mean the
death of the Honor System.

Perhaps this is the best reason
why this symbolic tradition we call
conventional dress must survive.

was considered successtul.

The divided attention grew out
of a great strain the combined

words, ,arents’ Weekend — had
grown too big for itself. But, this

20 THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

One of the bright dis-
coveries of the 1965 foot-
ball season was the pass-
ing of sophomore quar-
lerback ANDY ~~ BLOOM.
Here Boom, No. 14, com-
pletes a touchdown pass
fo All-State end ‘TERSH
BAKER in the Generals’
win over Southwestern.
Bloom threw eight TD
passes in’ the last six
games of the season.

 

Injuries to Key Players Are a Big

Factor in Football’s 3-6 Season

T WAS THAT KIND Of year at Wash-
I ington and Lee where injuries,
an inconsistent offense, and many
passing opponents combined to
prevent the Generals from anything
better than a 3-6 football season.

Ironically, the Generals were
supposed to have finished around 6-
3, based on a solid offensive unit
and a stingy defense that had been
ranked tenth nationally among
small college pass defenders in
1964.

Signs of the disappointing year
appeared early, even before the
Generals began thinking of their
first game September 25. Senior
halfback Harry Brookby was in-
jured during the Generals’ only pre-
season scrimmage and was declared
out for the year with a broken arm.
Another halfback and an expected

FALL 1965

By A. MICHAEL PHILIPPS
Sports Publicity Director

starter, sophomore Luke Crosland,
also was told that he had to sit out
the year because of illness.

After that, injuries to key per-
sonnel came week by week. In all,
twelve players missed a majority
of the season, including senior half-
back Ed Bradbury and senior full-
back Mike Goode, both of whom
were out after the first two games.

“This was the worst year for in-

juries since I’ve been here,” said

head coach lee McLaughlin. “Al-
though we'vc always been accus-
tomed to haying our share of dis-
abled players, we've never had so
many out thresghout the season.

We kept Johnson & Johnson in
business all year.”

When McLaughlin wasn’t worry-
ing about his injured list, he was
concerned about his offense. Ex-
cept for senior fullback John An-
thony, and the late-season passing
of sophomore quarterback . Andy
Bloom, the Generals’ offensive unit
never really meshed. ‘The Generals
were shutout in three games and
could manage only one touchdown
each in two other games. The 3-6
season record was the worst since
1958 when W&L was 1-7.

When all else failed, Anthony
still was the big man for the Gen-
erals. ‘he senior carried 197 times
for g15 yards and 42 points. He av-
eraged close to 102 rushing yards
per game and 4.6 yards per carry

21

os

 

while on his way to erasing Walt
Michaels’ modern _ single-season
rushing record of 719, set in 1950,
the ‘Gator Bowl season. Anthony’s
biggest game was against South-
western of Memphis when he car-
ried 35 times for 174 yards and
three touchdowns.

Bloom’s passing became better
as the season progressed. Against
Southwestern, he hit nine passes
of 12 attempts for 140 yards and
one touchdown, while he complet-
ed 18 of 33 attempts for 232 yards
and two touchdowns at Washing-
ton University in the season finale.
Altogether, he threw eight touch-
down passes during the year.

“Bloom's going to be a real fine
one,” said McLaughlin. “He won
the Guilford game almost single-
handed by throwing three touch-
down passes despite coming off the
bench without a great deal of act-
ual game experience.”

One of the Generals’ big disap-
pointments this year was their in-
ability to come up with a pass de-
fense at the right time. Although

 

Fullback JOHN ANTHONY

W&L picked off 18 enemy passes,
the opponents connected on key
throws time and time again for
first downs and scoring plays.
Indicative of the Generals’ year-
long plight was Washington’s suc-
cess in passing for 304 yards and
four touchdowns. Altogether, nine
Opponents completed gg passes of

21g attempts for 1,306 yards, 61
first downs, and ten touchdowns.

“We certainly had our problems
in pass defense,”
“Itll be one phase of our game
that will get strict attention next
year, especially since we'll lose most
of our starting players to gradua-
tion.”

said McLaughlin.

The Generals will see a total of
21 players graduated this June,
leaving McLaughlin with a young
and inexperienced team for 1966.
This year’s freshman squad was
4-2, however, so there may be some
hope for the comeback that was
supposed to have happened _ this
season.

™ COACH DICK MILLER’S cross-coun-
try team stretched its seasonal win-
ning streak to seven consecutive
years as the Generals posted a 6-1
record this fall, the fourth year in
a row that Miller’s squad has lost
only one meet.

Captain Lee Johnson led the
Generals, taking four first-place
finishes, two seconds, and one third.
In addition, the senior sociology
major from Louisville, Ky., set a
new W&L record on the 4.1 mile-
long course, covering the distance
in 23:40. The old record of 24:10
was held by Charlie Head.

A highlight of the season was the
first annual College Athletic Con-
ference meet held at Washington
University in St. Louis, where the
Generals finished second to the
host Bears. ‘team members John-
son, Bill Lowry, George Parker,
Bob Stack, Bill Wildrick, Ralph
Pearcy and Rif O'Conner combined

99

to give the Generals 47 points,
which put W&L above Centre,
Southwestern, and Sewanee.

= ALTHOUGH the Generals’ soccer
team completed a 7-3-2 season, it
was somewhat of a long, frustrating
year for Coach Joe Lyles’ experi-
enced team. Three games, includ-
ing an important second-round
state tournament contest, went into
double overtime, and three times
the Generals failed to record a win.

The tournament game ofhcially
ended, o-o, but the win was given
to Randolph-Macon on the basis
of more corner kicks (6-5). ‘he
Generals, who had beaten the Yel-
low Jackets, 2-1, earlier in the year,
came back to win over Virginia
Tech, 2-1, to wind up third in
VISA standings.

Fullback Dave Redmond was
named to the All-South and AII-
State teams while halfback ‘Tim
Henry and wing Dave Kirkpatrick
joined Redmond on the Virginia
all-star squad. It was Henry’s fourth
year on the All-State team.

RESHMEN—some of them the re-
f sult of a frenzied recruiting ef-
fort by Coach Verne Canfield—
hold the key to success or failure
for the Generals on the basketball
courts this season.

After suffering through a harrow-
Ing 2-17 season in his first work as
a college coach, Canfield took to
the U.S. mails and the highways to
seek out promising basketball tal-
ent and persuade its possessors to
come to Lexington.

His recruiting weapons were
limited: the opportunity to study
at a good undergraduate college, a
shot at financial aid if they quali-
fied on merit and need, and the
prospect of considerable varsity ac-
tion as a freshman player.

Canfield’s approach was similar
to the magnificent effort by foot-
ball coach Lee McLaughlin in
1957-58 when a similar recruiting
drive attracted freshmen who
helped build the undefeated elev-
ens of 1960 and 1961. Whether the
former highly — successful high
school basketball coach will be as
successful—and as fortunate—as Mc-
Laughlin remains to be seen, but he
is at least making progress.

Three of his freshmen already
have made significant difference in
the team’s performance in early
December campaigning, and while
the record is still a losing one, the
Generals have matched last season’s

FALL 1965

 

 

CAPTAIN Bos SPESSARD with

victory total and surely will win
more.
The best of the new men is 6-2,

185-pound forward Rob Bauer,
whose credentials include  AIl-
State honors at Pensacola, Fla.

Through ten games he has been
averaging close to 14 points per
game, and Canfield tabs him as a
genuine future star.

Another freshman _ starter is
John Carrere, a 6-1 guard from
New Orleans, where he played on
the Louisiana state championship
team. Carrere scored 21 points in
his varsity debut in the season
Opener against Bridgewater Col-
lege, and this was, by two, a better
freshman mark than Dom Flora,
'57, the Generals’ greatest point-
maker ever, made in his first game,
also against Bridgewater.

From Lexington High School’s
Valley District champs, Canfield
got 6-5 Earl Edwards, a strong re-
bounder who has filled in admir-

COACH VERNE CANFIELD

ably for senior center Bob Spessard
on several occasions.

Spessard, the team captain for
1965-66, continues to be an on and
off player, and he and everyone
else has at last learned to accept the
fact that he will never be the player
his father was. But he adds exper-
lence, 6-5 height, steady rebound-
ing and occasional scoring spurts
to the W&L effort, and Canfield
looks for the Roanoke senior to
have his best year.

Steve Sweitzer, another senior
letterman, is likewise hot and cold,
but he has the potential of playing
good basketball when the mood is
upon him. Sophomore Jody Kline,
a 6-2 leaper from Sault St. Marie,
Mich., rounds out the starting five,
and in Kline the Generals could
have a real comer if his improve-
ment continues.

All in all, things are looking
up... the only view possible from
the bottom of the well.

1965—-A Colorful Homecoming

WASHINGTON AND LEE’S

ITH
alumni spread to the four

winds, Homecoming in Lexington
has never been the big spectacular

that it is on many campuses. Never-
theless, those alumni who do come
back for the annual weekend find
the experience rewarding, and in
the case of football heroics, highly
exciting.

Some things change. Pep rally

paraders carry flares instead of
torches, and no one wears pajamas.
Classmates and friends can get to-
gether before and after the game
at the luncheon and jamboree spon-
sored by the Alumni Association.
Next year, the presence of the
Alumni House should make for an
even better Homecoming event.

As for the football excitement,

this year the Generals scored two
touchdowns in the final two min-
utes of play to edge a strong and
highly favored Guilford College
team, 26-20, after all seemed lost
indeed.

Last year, the Generals upset
unbeaten Sewanee to delight the
Homecomers, and this tradition of
success is one Coach Lee McLaugh-
lin would like to maintain.

 

Homecoming events this year included a torch parade on the eve of the football game

with Guilford College’s Quakers. A good crowd turned out, including some who couldn't

get a baby-sitter. The Phi Psi’s won the prize for the best house display, mainly because
they resisted the temptation to play upon the “Cream the Quakers” theme that the

other seventeen houses adopted.

Chapters Begin ‘Their Campaigns

To Support the Alumni House Fund

By WILLIAM C. WASHBURN

Executive Secretary

Washington and Lee University Alumni, Inc.

HE INK ON THE CONTRACT was

hardly dry when W. W. Coffey
& Son, the construction contractor
for the Alumni House, began to
work.

At first it appeared the demoli-
tion phase at 34 University Place
would level the house to the
ground. From the ripping down
of the old wooden porch to the
clanging sound of pipes and radia-
tors, the noise was evidence enough
of change. As the old cracked plas-

26

ter was removed, a cloud of dust
seemed to engulf the place. But
finally the sound of the crowbar
and pneumatic drill was superseded
by the hum of the electric saw and
the rap of the hammer. With the
new outside terrace on three sides
of the house now completed and
many of the new partitions for the
lounges and other rooms in place,
things are beginning to take shape.
Progress is on the move.
Fortunately, there has been

mild weather for much of the out-
side construction. Because there is
heat in the house (the facility is on
the University’s heating system), the
construction crews can continue
to make good progress during the
more severe weather ahead.

While in the meantime back at
the mine! The financial campaign
to raise the required $100,000 is
under way. H. Graham Morison,
92, national chairman of the House
Fund, and his ten area vice-chair-

tained and each chapter organized
to conduct a personal campaign.
All chapters, realizing their respon-
sibility and harboring a keen desire
to make all of this possible, have
eagerly accepted the challenge.
Promotional material for each
chapter campaign has been deliv-
ered, and many of the chapters are
well into their programs. ‘Those
alumni in areas not affiliated with

FALL 1965

an organized chapter have received
through the mail an appeal for
support.

It is too early yet to make an
overall report, but Chairman Mor-
ison urges each alumnus to give
this important project his undivid-
ed attention and a high priority on
the list seeking his support. Mori-
son stated in a recent letter to the
chapter chairmen, “Washington
and Lee’s indispensable resource
lies in its widely dispersed alumni.
Without their informed and con-
tinued interest, guidance, and sup-
port, its other assets will not sus-
tain its important role in our na-
tion. Washington and Lee’s future

is our concern and we should cre-
ate this place of welcome to alumni
on the campus that will so signifi-
cantly mark our identity with our
University. By this act we will
make a basic contribution to the
preservation and endowment of our
University’s indispensable re-
source.”

When the Alumni House cam-
paign worker calls on you, consider
this appeal earnestly and give gen-
erously. Should you be one in the
ranks of devoted alumni not afhli-
ated with an organized chapter,
please consider this another request
for your support. ‘This House is for
all alumni. Let’s each take part.
