encourage the use of the Alumni
House for appropriate University
functions when these would not
conflict with alumni use.

The Alumni House is an out-
growth of more than a year of care-
ful study and planning by the Al-
umni Board of Directors and a spe-
cial ad hoc house committee of
board members. Besides the cur-
rent president, past presidents E.
Alton Sartor, Jr., °38, of Shreveport,
‘La. and Dr. John D. Battle, °34, of
Cleveland, Ohio, were leaders in
getting the project started. Sartor,
Robert A. Fulwiler, Jr., °25, of Wil-
mington, Del., and E. Stewart Ep-
ley, 49, of New York made up the
ad hoc committee.

The alumni directors worked
closely with alumni Executive Sec-
retary William C. Washburn, Unt-
versity President Fred C. Cole and
other members of the University
administration, the University
Board of ‘Trustees, and the Univer-
sity architects, Clark, Nexsen, and
Owen of Lynchburg, Va.

Plans and specifications were de-
vised, and various plans for financ-
ing the project were discussed by
the alumni board and their col-
leagues at the University. Final ap-
proval of all plans came at the
June meeting of the alumni board.
‘The contract was awarded to the

SUMMER 1965

 

Lexington firm of W. W. Coffey &
Son, general contractors who have

worked successfully for Washing-
ton and Lee on numerous other
building and remodeling projects.

The decision to remodel rather
than build was made after the Uni-
versity architects estimated that a
new building to provide the same
space would cost twice as much as
the expense of renovation.

Simultaneously with the start of
actual work on the remodeling, the
fund campaign to support the pro-
ject swung into action. In a letter
to all chapter presidents. President
Nuckols announced the appoint-
ment of Mr. Morison as the na-
tional chairman of the house fund
campaign.

In charting plans for the house
fund campaign, particular concern
was expressed by the Alumni Board
of Directors and the 1965-66 Alum-
ni Fund Council as to the effect
such a capital campaign might
have on the vital annual program
of alumni giving. Consideration
was given to a merger of the two
efforts, but a final decision was
made in favor of two separate fund
campaigns.

Executive Secretary Washburn,
on whose shoulders rests the ad-
ministrative responsibility for both
the house fund drive and the an-

 

nual Alumni Fund, explained the
decision for two, separate cam-
paigns in this way:

“Each fund effort will serve a dis-
tinctive and equally important pur-
pose. ‘he House Fund campaign is
a capital campaign to provide a
critically-needed facility for alum-
ni use. It will be an intensive, one-
shot solicitation of all alumni. The
Annual Fund will continue to func-
tion as the vital year to year sup-
port which our alumni so generous-
ly extend to the ongoing work of
the University itself, the support of
higher education at Washington
and Lee. Our dual effort this year is
much like the situation most of us
have encountered in our churches,
where a building campaign often
runs concurrently with the annual
every-member canvass.”

“We hope our alumni will rec-
ognize how important both the Al-
umni House and the Annual Fund
are to the association and to the
University,” Washburn added.

A special feature of the House
fund campaign is the plan to con-
centrate its major effort through
the association’s forty-three active
alumni chapters.

In President Nuckols’ letter to
chapter presidents, he explained
how the alumni board had declined
the University Board of ‘Trustees’

space for our secretaries, for our
files, for our office machines, and
for storage,” he explained. “We'll
be able to do a better job in vir-
tually every phase of our regular
work, and most important, we'll be
able to serve the individual alum-
nus and the various chapters in bet-
ter fashion than we’ve been able
to do previously.”

And he said the projected use of
the Alumni House for appropriate
faculty functions will help strength-
en the ties between alumni and the
faculty.

“T believe we’re moving into an

area of new alumni interest in the
University, an area of new alumni
concern for its future progress, and
I believe the presence of our A\l-

umni House and its use by Wash-
ington and Lee men will be a posi-
tive factor in sustaining and en-
couraging this new interest,” Wash-
burn said.

‘“‘T hope every alumnus will start
making his plans now to return to
Washington and Lee next spring
and make use of our new home at
the very first opportunity,” he said.

New House Will Feature Comfort, Utility

ASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVER-
W sity alumni’s new home will
serve a variety of purposes, and
the remodeling and renovation nec-
essary to adapt the former faculty
residence for these purposes are
substantial.

The architects’ rendering of the
way the Alumni House will appear
is carried on the cover of this mag-
azine. On another page there is a
floor plan of the building, showing
both the layout of the old house
and the new arrangements to ac-
commodate the association’s offices
and the general purpose uses of the
building.

The Alumni House is and will
be a big house. ‘The lounges, foyer,
and card room of the first floor will
provide ample space for reunions,
receptions, parties, and other so-
cial activities. In good weather,
porches which will encircle the first
floor on three sides will provide
additional room, and it is expect-
ed that approximately 450 guests
can be accommodated at one time
with all facilities in use.

A kitchen will be equipped to
facilitate serving light luncheons
and other refreshments on a ca-
tered basis. The necessary appoint-
ments, including sink, stove, re-
frigerator, and other appliances,
will be functional but not elabor-
ate. The kitchen will also have
facilities for uncatered serving of
soft drinks, set-ups, and coffee and
tea.

p

A movable bar is planned for
use on the porches or in the loung-
es as needed. When not in use it
can be stored in the kitchen’s serv-
ing pantry.

Adequate rest room facilities will
be located conveniently.

In addition to serving as a site
for receptions, parties, and other
planned events, the Alumni House
will be a place for informal social-
izing and for meetings of alumni
during weekends when appreciable
numbers of alumni are on campus.
And the House will be a place for
the casual alumni visitor to check
in, be welcomed by the alumni sec-
retary, and relax with his family
during their visit to the University.

No effort is being made now to
provide overnight guest facilities
at the Alumni House.

Decorations and furnishings for
the lounges and other first floor
rooms will be tasteful and comfort-
able. Materials of interest to alum-
ni, such as back issues of the Calyx,
the University catalogue, and the
Alumni Magazine, will be avail-
able for browsing.

‘The second floor will be the cen-
ter of the Alumni Association’s
routine administration. Executive
Secretary Washburn’s office will be
located here, along with the sec-
retarial offices, the active files, and
the equipment necessary for carry-
ing on the varied activities of the
Alumni Office,

A Board Room will be furnished
to provide an appropriate meet-
ing place for the Alumni Board of
Directors, the Alumni Fund Coun-
cil, and other special groups.

Access to the second floor will in-
clude a ramp at the rear of the
house which will facilitate the easy
moving of magazines and other
printed materials into the work-
rooms for addressing, packaging,
and other activities.

Part of the remodeling includes
special structural reinforcements to
support heavy office equipment
used by the Alumni Office and _ to
soundproof the operation of this
equipment from the other parts of
the building.

Provision for air-conditioning of
the entire house is being made, but
at the outset only the second floor,
where year-around use is planned,
will be cooled. When air-condition-
ing is added to the first floor, it will
be possible to regulate temperatures
separately at the different levels.

The attic level will be used for
dead files and storage.

Landscaping will include terraces
and walls for the yard facing on
Letcher Avenue and for parking at
the back for the Alumni Office
staff and a limited number of visi-
tors’ cars.

Maintenance, repair, and utility
costs of the Alumni House will be
borne by the University, which
supports the Alumni Office to this
extent in its present location.

AIN FELL on part of Washing-
R ton and Lee University’s finals
program this year for the first time
in the memories of most persons
now associated with the university.

After intermittent showers dur-
ing the morning forced a change in
the usual processional arrangement
for Baccalaureate, the rain finally
came down in buckets while the
Evans Hall sermon by Chaplain
David W. Sprunt was in progress.

The downpour inconvenienced
many seniors and their families,
and it made for congested condi-
tions in the dining hall when the
Alumni Association’s luncheon for
eraduates, families, and faculty—
normally held outdoors on_ the
lawn before the President’s Home—
was moved inside. Over a thousand
guests sidestepped the busy work-
men who cleared chairs and
brought in tables and set up serv-
ing counters.

Next day the sun shone in ac-
customed Commencement fashion,
and few umbrellas that the faithless
had brought hung unneeded on the
back of the speaker’s platform, or

leaned almost forgotten against
trees.
The graduating class was—by

four students over the 1964 record

SUMMER 1965

number—the largest ever to march
up for June diplomas. A total of
257 accepted degrees from Presi-
dent Fred C. Cole, as an estimated
1,700 persons looked on and/or
took pictures.

Dean C. P. Light, Jr., presented
thirty-six candidates for the LL.B.,
and Dean Lewis W. Adams _pre-
sented thirty-three candidates for
the B.S. in Commerce and _ thirty-
eight for the B.A. in political sci-
ence or economics. Dean William
W. Pusey, III, presented 134 candi-
dates for B.A. degrees, thirteen for
B.S. degrees, and three for B.S. de-
grees with special attainments in
chemistry.

Honorary degrees were conferred
upon two outstanding alumni and
two other distinguished = men.
Doctor of Laws degrees were be-
stowed upon William C. Norman,
28, of Crossett, Ark.; Matthew W.
Paxton, ‘18, of
Richard P. ‘Thomsen of Alexan-
dria, Va. The Doctor of Letters
degree was awarded to Dr. Ar-
thur S. Link of Princeton, N. J.,
(See Page 18).

Jon A. Supak, the much-honored
senior from Virginia Beach, Va.,
delivered the valedictory address in

Lexington; and

which he said that every individual

 

deserves the freedom to stand alone,
live his own life in whatever way
he wishes, without limitations of
artificial restrictions.
President Cole, addressing the
sixth senior class to graduate since

social

he assumed the presidency in 1959-
60, urged the commencement au-
dience to learn from history but
not to be restricted by what has
happened in the past. (His full
text begins on Page 19).

In customary procedure, Presi-
dent Cole called the commence-
ment audience’s attention to the
lists of awards and prizes for grad-
uates and students in the gradua-
tion program. He singled out for
special mention Christopher Mc-
Callum Kell of Haddonfield, N. J.,
who won the Algernon Sydney Sul-
livan Medallion for outstanding
achievement in University citizen-
ship, and James W. DeYoung of
Kennilworth, Ill., winner of the
Krank J.

tions to university life.

MATTHEW WHITE PAXTON, attorney, editor and
publisher, and civic leader, Lexington, Virginia.

“Among Washington and Lee’s distinguished alumni
are natives of this community who have continued to
enrich the University and its family by rendering con-
stant and magnanimous service to their Alma Mater and
by assuming roles of leadership in the town of Lexington.
Such an exemplary graduate is M. W. Paxton whose
wisdom, sound judgment, broad influence, and personal
integrity have touched every worthwhile endeavor in this
communily for more than half a century, As a member
of the Rockbridge County bar, and as owner, editor and
publisher of one of the commonwealth’s most influential
weekly newspapers, he has contributed profoundly to the
progress and development of this vicinity where his in-
terests have embraced civic, cultural, religious, charitable,
and historical affairs. No degree conferred by Washington
and Lee University has ever been given with greater ad-
miration and affection than the Doctor of Laws degree it
now awards to M. W. Paxton.”

ARTHUR STANLEY LINK, Edwards Professor of
American History, Princeton University, Prince-
ton, New Jersey.

“Acclaimed as the nation’s foremost authority on the
life of Woodrow Wilson and this great American influ-
ence upon the nation and the world, Professor Link is
that rarity among American scholars who is able to trans-
late the fruits of exhaustive research and analysis into
published works that are as lucid in their literary quality
as they are sound in their scholarship. Author of thirteen
volumes of history, Professor Link twice has won the
coveted Bancroft Prize for biography with his incisive
studies of President Wilson. Honored abroad as Harms-
worth Professor at Oxford, he now holds a distinguished
chair in American history at one of the nation’s great-
est universities where he is currently directing a projected
forty-volume_ collection of Woodrow Wilson papers.
Washington and Lee University is proud to confer upon
this native Virginian its degree of Doctor of Letters for
the way in which he is bringing such distinction to the
academic profession.”

WILLIAM CLARENCE NORMAN, manulacturing
executive and banker, Crossett, Arkansas.

“As an honor graduate of Washington and Lee and
of the Advanced Management Course at the Harvard
University School of Business, and as banker and in-
dustrialist, William Norman’s career has been one of
superior scholarship, good citizenship, and sound manage-
ment—all coveted qualities for leaders in the business
world. As vice-president of one of America’s grealesl
companies—the Georgia-Pacific Corporation—he directs
the production of goods that enrich our lives and uses
his wise management to assure the prudent use and con-
servation of one of our country’s greatest natural re-
sources. His capacity for capable and unselfish leadership
has extended to his community and his state where he
has served generously, particularly in his 20-year presiden-
cy of the Crossett Board of Education. His accomplish-
ments reflect credit upon his Alma Mater and, with
gratitude and pride, Washington and Lee University
awards to William Norman its degree of Doctor of Laws.”

RICHARD PORTER THOMSEN, headmaster, the
Episcopal High School, Alexandria, Virginia.

‘A graduate of the distinguished young man’s pre-
paratory school that he now heads, Richard Thomsen 1s
recognized throughout the United States as one of the
outstanding headmasters in American secondary educa-
tion. His appreciation for academic excellence was
sharpened by his own experiences at two of the nation’s
great universilties—Yale and Johns Hopkins—and as box-
ing captain at Yale he learned, too, of the value of
physical fitness to the good scholar, The program he
directs at Episcopal High School is a model in its ef-
fective emphasis on the development of the mind and
body. Episcopal High School’s graduates go forth an-
nually to enroll in the best colleges and universities, and
Washington and Lee has been proud to count among its
finest students young men who first studied under Rich-
ard Thomsen. In recognition of the many achievements
of this good partner in the education of young men,
Washington and Lee University proudly confers upon
him its degree of Doctor of Laws.”

The long cherished dream of an
Alumni House is now approaching
reality and following my report I
will ask Mr. Epley and Mr. Plow-
man who have worked so diligently
on the House Committee to give
a report on its present status.

[I am happy to advise that yester-
day Bill Washburn and myself, rep-
resenting the entire Alumni Asso-
clation, met with the University
Board of ‘Trustees in their busi-
ness meeting. It was a very fine oc-
casion for me and I think that the
exchange of information by such a
meeting was most fruitful. 1 might
add that the University Board of
‘Trustees is in full support of the
plans being made for an Alumni
House. I can also assure you that
the University Board of ‘Trustees
feels a very close relationship to the
work, the aims and purposes of the
Alumni Association.

The adoption of the revised Ar-
ticles of Incorporation was neces-
sary because of a change several
years ago in the number of mem-
bers on the Alumni Board of Di-
rectors. While going into this mat-

ter it was found that there were
several other changes — which,
though incorporated in the prac-
tice of the Alumni Association, had
not been properly recorded with
the State Corporation Commission.
I am happy to say that all of this
has now been completed with the
revision of the Articles of Incor-
poration. It has been cleared by the
State Corporation Commission and
approved by the Alumni Board of
Directors. It is planned to have
these Articles printed in booklet
form in the near future for distri-
bution to the Alumni Chapters and
other interested alumni. In all of
this work, which took considerable
time and effort and several meet-
ings in Richmond with the State
Corporation Commission, the AI-
umni Association is indebted to
Professor Robert Huntley of our
Law School for his good help and
advice.

You have just heard a_ report
from the ‘Treasurer on the present
status of the Alumni Fund. While
we are short of our goal, our fig-
ure as of this date exceeds last

year’s figure at this same time by
some $10,000. At this point I would
like to pause to acknowledge our
debt and express our thanks to the
Alumni Fund Council which was
headed by Robert Taylor of Lynch-
burg and also our deep apprecia-
tion to the fine organization of
class agents and regional agents.
Our continued goals for the annual
Alumni Fund should be an exten-
sion in terms of total contribu-
tions and more particularly in a
broader participation on the part
of more alumni.

In the realm of organization, |
believe your Association continues
to be strong. It would be hard to
keep up with all of the various ac-
tivities but we are indebted to
President Cole, members of the
staff and faculty and Bill Wash-
burn who have, over this past year,
visited many of the forty-three or-
ganized chapters.

The Alumni Magazine continues
to be our main avenue of commun-
ication. It has, I think, become in-
creasingly effective in terms of its
content and its reflection of the

My report would be entirely too
long should I cover all of the usual
activities which are carried on here
during the school year. I might
mention, however, that the Home-
coming and Reunion festivities
continue to be high-lights of the
year. This year, for the first time,
there was added the fifth anniver-
sary class. Therefore, we now have
five anniversary classes which are
coming back to campus in_ the
spring for Reunion time. Serious
consideration is being given to the
addition of other classes. Our stu-
dent-alumni relations is an import-
ant field of operation. Your Asso-
clation takes a prominent place
‘ach year at Freshman Camp, and
of course, we continue with our an-
nual Senior Banquet at which time
we honor and welcome those who
are entering the ranks of alumni.

During this past year I have come
to appreciate the job that Bill
Washburn is doing. It is a demand-

lems, and endless detail. He gets all

I feel that definite progress has
been made this year. Now we must
