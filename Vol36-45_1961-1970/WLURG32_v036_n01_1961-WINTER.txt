O YOU REMEMBER back in 1903, when the captain of the Washington
and Lee football team, a center named Thomas Green “Tubby”
Stone, designed the W. and L. monogram, a trident, which the University
has used ever since? “Tubby” was a great athlete—captain of the Albert
Sidney crew, the track team, and the grid team, and reflected credit to
his alma mater. It was not until 1951, however, that he was honored for
his design. In ceremonies at his home in Union Mills, North Carolina,
“Tubby” was awarded a plaque from the Alumni Association. Participants
were, left to right, above: Mrs. Stone; J. Davis Kerr, ’24; H. J. Blackford,
a7 WS: Phillips, *11; and Wiley B. Hampton, ’og. Mr. Stone, in a short
speech of appreciation, pointed out that the trident was patterned after
Neptune’s emblem of rulership. Tubby died December 8, 1960, but his
memory will live on, emblazoned in the trident worn by Washington and Lee athletes, in the present and future.

The Civil War Centennial

WASHINGTON AND LEE MEN HELPED

TO START IT IN EARLY Ga

MERICA’S GREAT observance of
A the Civil War Centennial, a
five-year effort to awaken the na-
tion to the principles which made
it great, has begun, and Washing-
ton and Lee University is having
a major part in it. While ceremon-
les paying tribute to the memory of
General U. S. Grant were held re-
cently at his tomb in New York, a
similar program was taking place
in Lee Chapel on the campus of the
University where General Robert
E. Lee spent his last years.

Washington and Lee was repre-
sented in another way at the cere-
monies at Lexington, for four of
the participants were either mem-
bers of its faculty or alumni. ‘The
principal address was delivered by
Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines,
chancellor of the University. He
was introduced by Congressman
William M. Tuck, ’21, vice-chair-
man of the National Civil War
Centennial Commission, the agency
created by Congress to plan and co-
ordinate the Centennial observ-
ance. Its liaison officer, Virgil Car-
rington Jones, ’30, presided, and
was introduced by Dr. William G.
Bean, head of the history depart-
ment, who had charge of arrange-
ments.

‘These programs in New York
and at Lexington, dedicated to the
senior commanders on opposing
sides who became symbolic figures
of Americanism during and after
the war, formally began the Cen-
tennial observance. As projected, it
will continue until the last anni-
versary of the war in 1965 with a
variety of programs, most of them
dignified and of a religious nature,
and with a few reenactments. A

a

 

part of this effort will be aimed at
preserving historic records and
marking historic sites.

The first major battle reenact-
ment will take place at Manassas,
Virginia, on July 22-23 of this year.
V.C. (“Pat”) Jones, ’30, is chairman
of the non-profit corporation
formed to stage the ceremony.
More than 2,000 men, it 1s esti-
mated, each wearing authentic uni-
forms and carrying authentic weap-
ons of the period, will take part.

Of additional interest were
events scheduled in February at
Montgomery, Alabama, to mark
the inauguration of Jefferson Da-
vis as President of the Confederacy.
For seven days the city was occu-
pied with religious services, lunch-
eons, spectaculars, pyrotechnic dis-
plays, essay contests, style shows,
and pilgrimages. The highlight of

the commemorative ceremonies Oc-
curred on February 17, at which
time the inauguration of a century
ago was authentically reenacted.

On March 4 at Washington,
D.C., the first inauguration of Ab-
raham Lincoln was to be reenacted.
This, too, was to be staged in au-
thentic detail, beginning with a
parade down historic Pennsylvania
Avenue, followed by a joint session
of Congress at which Raymond
Massey, distinguished for his im-
personation of Lincoln, -was to de-
liver the war President’s inaugural
address.

Another major observance this
year is scheduled for April. ‘This
will be a ceremony at Charleston,
South Carolina, to call attention to
details concerning the firing on
Fort Sumter at the start of the war.

 

Participants in the Centennial ceremony here were, left to right: V. C. JonEs, ’30; DR. W.
G. BEAN, representing the state Centennial commission; BisHor LLoyp R. CRAIGHILL; Mrs.
BACHMAN, president-general of the United Daughters of the Confederacy; CHANCELLOR
FRANCIS P. GAINES; REP. WILLIAM M. TUCK, ’21; vice-chairman of national commission.

Science Building To Begin Soon

ASHINGTON AND LEE Univer-
W sity’s Board of Trustees has
authorized the university to proceed
with plans to construct a new sci-
ence building intended for use in
September, 1962.

‘The new structure will house the
departments of physics and biology,
and will help relieve generally
crowded conditions in Howe Hall,
the present science building accom-
modating the chemistry, geology,
and biology departments.

Howe Hall will undergo remod-
eling and will receive a new wing
of classrooms, laboratories, and an
observatory as a part of the current
building project.

President Fred C. Cole said uni-
versity architects will submit plans
to contractors for bids later this
month, and work is expected to get
underway in early spring.

‘The project marks the culmina-
tion of a two-year University De-
velopment Program which began in
January, 1959, to raise $2,000,000
for improving Washington and
Lee’s facilities for science, journal-
ism, and pre-engineering.

A total of 4,038 donors have sub-
scribed more than the $2,000,000
originally sought, President Cole
said, but he added that the fund
campaign is continuing. Approxi-

mately $500,000 realized through
the campaign’s efforts, was desig-
nated by donors for scholarships,
faculty salaries, and general endow-
ment, he explained. (See chart on
page 21.)

Although additional funds are
still needed to equip the new facili-
ties, President Cole said sufficient
funds are ‘“‘on hand, or in sight’ ’to
begin work.

“The urgency of the need for im-
proved science accommodations has
caused the Trustees to decide to
proceed,” President Cole said. “We
are confident the additional funds
will be available when they are re-
quired.”

President Cole cited a growing
interest and competency on the part
of Washington and Lee students in
science and technology. He said
Washington and Lee’s new plans
will help give proper emphasis to
scientific instruction in the univer-
sity’s liberal arts program and en-
hance its programs in pre-medical
work and pre-engineering studies.

The university plans to provide
all four scientific departments with
modern instructional laboratories
and classrooms, library and display
facilities, and general facilities, in-
cluding an observatory for physics,
a vivarium and greenhouse for biol-

ogy, a seismology room for geology,
and an instrumental analysis labor-
atory for chemistry.

A special feature in all depart-
ments, President Cole pointed out,
will be separate research laboratory
accommodations for faculty and
student projects. The Robert E. Lee
Research Fund was established at
Washington and Lee to promote
faculty-student projects in all aca-
demic departments, including the
sciences.

When the physics department
and pre-engineering studies vacate
the present Reid Hall, that build-
ing will be available for remodel-
ing and use for other purposes,
principally those of the Depart-
ment of Journalism and Communi-
cations, President Cole said. Reid
Hall, built in 1904, is the only aca-
demic building at Washington and
Lee which has not been modern-
ized.

Architects for the new project
are Clark, Nexen, and Owen of
Lynchburg. They were assisted by
representatives of the science de-
partments, chiefly the department
heads: Dr. Robert E. Dickey, phy-
ics; Dr. Kenneth Stevens, biology;
Dr. Esmarch S. Gilreath, chemistry;
and Dr. Edgar W. Spencer, geol-

ogy.

“I Have Done Something To Protect
The Sons of Others From Ignorance”

JOHN ROBINSON GAVE HIS LIFE’S EARNINGS
TO BENEFIT YOUNG WASHINGTON COLLEGE

ANY HAVE HEARD of George
Washington’s generous gifts
to a school of learning in the west-
ern part of Virginia. Few know of
the Irish immigrant who left his en-
tire fortune to further the course
of learning at the same school. He,
along with “Big Foot”? Wallace and
John Jordan, all of Lexington, were
self-made men and each contrib-
uted to the fame of Rockbridge
County and the nation in a unique
way.

John Robinson was born in
Ormagh County, Ireland, in 1753.
Having lost his father at an early
age, he was bound by an uncle to
a weaver in order to learn the trade.
In 1770, he journeyed across the
sea and settled in Rockbridge
County. How he secured passage
over has never been revealed. Dr.
Archibald Alexander, who knew
him, wrote that Robinson was first
an itinerant weaver going from
house to house. It was said that he
was then seventeen years of age,
good natured and jovial. With the
coming of the Revolution, “he
served in various situations,” as
his will later claimed.

Upon his return from the service,
he was given a home with General
John Bowyer at “Thornhill,”
where he continued to engage in
weaving for the folk of the area
who were attracted by “his good
temper and good behaviour, with a
spice of Irish wit.” John had saved

Professor of H istory

enough money to buy himself a
poor horse, and by careful feeding
and training, he much improved
the animal. Come court day, he
resolved to see how he would fare
in trading his horse. His effort was
crowned with success and soon he
acquired other horses to fatten and
train. The market price was often
twice what he had paid for them.
So adept did he become at judging
good horses that he soon won the
nick-name of ‘Jockey’? and he ac-
cumulated a good sum for further
investment. Some of these animals
later sired race horses. Robinson
exemplified traits of honesty and
fair play which helped with his
enterprise.

The extra money he acquired
made him anxious to invest in
other ventures. In the Valley of
Virginia many Revolutionary sol-
diers possessed governmental se-
curities entitling them to receive
pay for their services. The Federal
government had not yet redeemed
these securities, but Robinson had
faith that they would. Many of the
soldiers needed ready cash and
were willing to sell them to Robin-
son at a large discount. The aver-
age sum secured was four to six-
pence to the pound. He offered in
good faith the current price for
the securities, and when the new
government under the direction of
Alexander Hamilton, against the
wishes of the leading Republicans,

redeemed the certificates at par
value, Robinson reaped the bene-
fit. If the soldier had sold his cer-
tificates for a small amount, it was
his doing. Robinson was thought
then to have considerable means.

Robinson decided to buy a farm,
although he was very inexperienced
in agriculture. From John Bowyer
he purchased a 4oo-acre holding
called Hart’s Bottom, an attractive
and fertile piece of land which is
included today in the Town of
Buena Vista. The name had come
from Silas Hart who acquired the
title from George III in 1746. This
purchase took a lot of Robinson’s
capital, and farming with slaves
proved more difficult than he had
anticipated. So he engaged in an-
other profitable business—that of
distilling whiskey—in which he be-
came very proficient. His stone dis-
tillery in later years harbored a
chopping mill. Jockey bought a
number of tracts of land in the
neighborhood, doubling the acre-
age of Hart’s Bottom, and included
land on Buffalo Creek and on the
Cow Pasture river. Altogether he
acquired almost 3,200 acres. His
slaves numbered some 60 and each
was well-cared for.

Robinson never married and
lived a lonely life. The only re-
creation he allowed himself was
riding a grey horse to Lexington,
some nine miles away, and spend-
ing the day talking with friends on

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

the street. Here, after taking a
leisurely ride into town, he would
visit the postofhice and then take a
chair on the street, if a warm and
pleasant day, visiting with such
personages as Ben Darst, Sam Petti-
grew, Archy Beard and Jimmy
Dold. As Robinson grew older, he
became more serious and his in-
terests took a benevolent turn. He
was made a trustee of The Ann
Smith Academy, a_ private girls’
school of Lexington. In 1820 he
took up $3,000 worth of claims
against the Academy to help keep
it open. He actually kept the
school from a Sheriff's sale.

His connection with Washington
College was very significant and
went back as far as 1803. When Lib-
erty Hall burned, he offered the
authorities a lot for a new site on

the edge of Lexington. The Trus-
tees thereupon resolved “that John
Robinson is entitled to the thanks
of ‘This Board for his generous con-
duct and benevolent donation to
Washington Academy.” Further
recognizing his interest in the
school, in 1819 he was made a Trus-
tee along with Andrew Heron, Sam
McD. Reid and John Leyburn. All
of these were present on March 12,
1819 to take the oath. Just at this
period, the General Assembly of
Virginia was desirous of establish-
ing a state university somewhere
and a number of committees were
asking that it be established in their
section. Lexington and the Board
of ‘Trustees of Washington College
offered a subscription to the state
of $70,000 if it could be located
here. John Robinson offered his

entire estate if the school could be
located within four miles of Lex-
ington. He had prepared a deed to
that effect saying:

“John Robinson of Hart’s Bottom in
the County of Rockbridge for and in
consideration of the promises have
given and granted and do by _ these
present give and grant, at and imme-
diately after my decease, to the Pres-
ident and directors of the Literary Fund
and to their successors in office for the
benefit of the University of Virginia
the following tracts of land lying in
said County. A tract of land lying on
the North Fork of the James River on
which I live conveyed to me by Gen-
eral John Bowyer containing 400 acres,
also an appendage of 171 acres and 1/2
conveyed to me by James Grigsby. Also
a tract of land adjoining the above
containing 203 acres conveyed to me by
the heirs of William Paxton, known
as Tavern Plantation. Also a tract of
land lying on the same river above the
lands of Arthur Glasgow containing
112 acres conveyed to me by William
Paxton’s heirs. Also a_ tract on said
river adjoining land of Arthur Glas-
gow, Benjamin Camden, D. Edmondson
and opposite the lands of Edmondson
containing 500 acres. A. tract of Pryor’s
Gap of 545 acres gotten from the heirs
of William Paxton is to be included,
as well as, a tract lying in Childers
Gap containing 266 acres conveyed by
William Mitchell, and finally a_ tract
in Childers Gap of 320 acres conveyed
by Nicholas Jones and a 22 acre field
just out of Lexington. That the Univer-
sity be located there or within four
miles of the said town within two years.
The remainder 500 acres on Buffalo
Creek adjoining lands of James Breck-
enridge, plus 57 slaves. All should be
sold at my death for investment to be
used for same.”

This showed Robinson’s deep in-
terest in higher education of the
day.

‘The State decided on Charlottes-
ville as the site for the Univer-
sity, so the will was never effective.
Between 1819-21, Robinson atten-
ded fairly regularly the Board
of ‘Trustees meetings, and in 1821
he was one of a committee for the
planning of a new building for the
college to be first known as the
“Central Building,” and ‘““Washing-
ton Hall” later. Serving along with
him on this committee were Robert
White, James McDowell and Sam
McD. Reid. The following year
Robinson gave $2,000 of the $9,000

JOHN ROBINSON

Continued

needed for the building, and was
counted on to help with the re-
mainder. John Jordan agreed to
build the brick structure with high
pillars supporting a porch. When
the building was completed in
1824, the cornerstone was laid, and
for the event, John Robinson had a
barrel containing 40 gallons of best
rye whiskey brought up to treat the
visitors. ‘Che drink was fruity and
ropy and the affair started by “Mr.
Robinson escorting two leading col-
lege authorities to the barrel.”
Courtesy was shown at first but the
thirsty crowd broke all restraints
and armed with cups and dippers
scooped into the barrel. Few re-
mained sober while many rolled
upon the ground. Finally the barrel
was upset and for the remainder of
the day, the college hill looked like
a battle field. Robinson was said to
have been disgusted as to how the
affair had gone. J. T. L. Preston
spoke of it in an address later say-
ing “that President Baxter and pro-
fessors had drunk from the barrel
and had deported themselves mer-
rily.” A Miss Louise Baxter object-
ed to this version, as late as 1873,
and spoke of the affair saying, that
when Robinson, a man of great
eccentricity, had drawn up his will,
and soon after his intention of
making this donation became
known, he sent a barrel of whiskey
to College Hill and that “such a
proceeding was considered an out-
rage.... Nothing but the well-
known singularity of the donor
could at all excuse the act, in the
opinion of the faculty and friends
of the college.”

John Robinson died on June 26,
1826, and his funeral was practical-
ly a “state” one, for according to
the Lexington papers, a great pro-
cession was formed of college trus-
tees, faculty, and literary society
representatives with his — slaves
bringing up the rear, to escort his

6

body from outside of town to a
tomb placed on the front campus.
Shortly before his death he had
two wills drawn. The first did not
please him, but the second one did,
being drawn by James McDowell,
later governor of Virginia, who was
a lawyer in Lexington and served
on the Board of ‘Trustees with
Robinson. Colonel William Pax-
ton, Robert White, Sam McDowell
Reid and James McDowell were
named executors of his estate.

The will was probated July 3,
1826. ‘The major parts of the will
are cited below:

“Having migrated to America just
in time to participate in the Revolu-
tionary struggle (which I did in var-
ious situations) and having since that
period by a long, peaceful interval with
my fellow citizens amassed a consider-
able estate which I am desirous of
rendering back to them upon terms
most likely to conduce to their essen-
tial and permanent interests, I do
therefore will and ordain:

t. Washington College is the only
intended heir of my estate.

2. Money secured from my estate is
to be used to purchase stock, that will
make a permanent fund to have a pro-
fessorship of Geology and Agriculture
so that the science of arts and life can
be taught.

6. I do hereby desire $1,500 from the
first clear proceeds of Hart’s Bottom
to be used to purchase two or more
medals to be given to graduates with
the highest scholastic attainment.

Having foreborn to gratify the par-
ticularities of friendship in the  be-

 

stowad. 2f personal favors which must

follow the judicious apppreciation of

the legacy which I leave to the public
instruction I hope that some facilities

have been given to the march of im-

provement, and some contribution made

to the welfare of society, and having
its members inspired at an early age
with the salutary and conservative les-
sons of knowledge and virtue. And
though a foreigner by birth and with-
out a child to provide for, I rejoice in
the trust that I have done something to
protect the sons of others from igno-
rance and vice, and something to con-
firm the political institutions of the
country by enlightening the public will
upon which they rest. For these ends

I cheerfully give up the earnings of

my life, and interests as my latest wish,

that they be so husbanded as to carry

forward the beneficient results which 1

contemplate.”

What a generous and thoughtful
statement, by one who had little, if
any academic training!

The final provision of the will
stated that all the lands of Robin-
son should be sold except Hart’s
Bottom and the slaves should be
used on this estate for a 50 year
period after which the whole might
be disposed of.

The college soon disposed of
the lands other than Hart’s Bot-
tom. It tried to manage the slaves
on the larger property but soon
found it unprofitable to run the
estate. ‘he college sought legal ad-
vice to enable it to dispose of the
remainder of the estate. Chapman
Johnson advised them and for a
time they leased Hart’s Bottom and
later disposed of it to William A.
Read in 1840. President Henry
Ruffner signed the transfer title.
The slaves were employed to fence
in the campus and do odd _ jobs
about. But the time came that the
slaves had to be sold too. ‘The hope
was that the whole could be sold to
one master, that the families might
not be broken up and, as one ex-
pressed it, that the method would
“not be food for the abolitionist
mills.” Both a Dr. W. A. Graham
of North Carolina wanted them
and a Samuel Garland of Arkansas.
The latter finally purchased 51 of
the slaves for $20,674.91. ‘These
were reported to be comfortably

located in Arkansas soon after, only
a “Caroline” had died shortly after
arrival. Several of the older ones
were retained by the college, and
one was cared for as late as 1878.

Other property of Robinson in-
cluded 100 volumes of books, three
stills, live-stock and 1,000 gallons
of whiskey. The latter went for
36 and 37 cents a gallon. The li-
brary included volumes of Sir
Walter Scott’s Rob Roy and Fran-
cisco Miranda’s Expedition.

The total monetary value of the
estate was figured at $46,500.00.
Some $15,000 to $20,000 was shortly
used for new buildings. One of
these buildings, built in 1841 was
a wing of Washington Hall and was
called Robinson Hall, housing
currently the Department of Math-
ematics and a portion of Romance
Languages.

To carry out the provisions of
Robinson’s will in 1929, the Board
of Trustees created the Robinson
Professorship of Chemistry. ‘The
long title of the department was
“Professorship of Chemical Arts
and Minerology with Special Ap-
plication to Agriculture.” L. G.
Garland was the first professor to
held this chair, with an annual sal-
ary of $600.00. The question of this
new professorship had already been
debated in the “town and gown”
literary society of the town—the
Franklin Society. ‘Today the Geolo-
gy Department still carries the title
of the “Robinson Foundation.”

To follow another desire of
Robinson, medals were granted to
the persons making the three high-
est grades in the college. These
medals were worth $20, $30 and
$40 and were first accorded in
1855 to D. Rodes Massie, John M.

Gay and W. F. Cocke. At present

To offer especial honor to bene-

an impressive monument should
cover his grave on the campus and

inscription. The following year
professor George D. Armstrong and
the proctor were requested to see
about placing the marker. Appar-
ently it was placed and then by
some chance, thrown down and
broken. In the next decade $500
was set aside to secure a new one.
President George Junkin, Hugh
Barclay, Samuel McD. Reid and
Dr. John Leyburn made up the
committee to see the job done. A
Philadelphia contractor prepared
the new Italian marble marker and
this was delivered on the steamer,
the “City of Richmond,” in 1855.
The monument was placed on a
concrete foundation, enclosing a
box of Robinson’s bones, plus a
current college catalogue, a dime of
1853, a copy of the laws of the col-
lege, a church paper (no doubt

his will. ‘The following inscription

give, as he had received, a gift for
education to his adopted land. This

ington and Lee University) re-

from which students still profit.

Alumni Were Gunning for Williams

FORMER LAW DEAN IS PARTICIPANT
IN SHOTGUN CEREMONY

GROUP OF former students of
Professor Clayton E. Wil-
liams found out it’s easier to please
than surprise the retired dean of
Washington and Lee University’s
School of Law.

Some thirty-four alumni planned
to do both, but while Dean Wil-
liams was pleased with the hand-
made, automatic, 20-gauge shotgun
they presented him in late Decem-
ber, he wasn’t quite as surprised
over the gift as his friends had
hoped he would be.

“I wasn’t so sure I was going to
get a gun that I brought along a
box of shells, but I was pretty sus-
picious of things,’ Dean Williams
said.

The presentation, made by Gra-
ham Morison, ’32, of Washington,
D. C., was planned to mark the end
of Dean Williams’ final year as
dean. His retirement from that of-
fice was effective last September.

“We just didn’t want to see 1960
end without expressing our grati-
tude to Dean Williams for all he
has meant to us,” Morison said.

Because Dean Williams is an ar-
dent, expert sportsman, Morison
said he and Martin P. Burks, III,
32, of Roanoke, conceived the idea
of a gift for hunting or fishing.

Mrs. Williams was asked for a
suggestion, and she told them Dean
Williams had shown a recent inter-
est in an automatic shotgun. Mor-
ison immediately placed an order
with the Remington firearms peo-
ple for one of the finest weapons
they produce.

But when some of Dean Wil-

liams’ Rockbridge County hunting
buddies found out what the gift
would be, they had reservations
about it.

“Skinny Williams was brought
up on an old-fashioned, double-bar-
relled shotgun,” said Cap’n Dick
Smith, former Washington and Lee
athletic director. ““He wouldn't any-
more own one of those fancy jobs
than fly to the moon!”

Here, says Morison, was some-
thing Dean Williams had dealt
with in forty-one years as law pro-
fessor—a conflict of evidence. To
resolve the issue, Smith, D. Allen
Penick, 30, Matthew W. Paxton,
°20, and others organized a hunt
for Dean Williams.

Around the campfire, they drew
him into a discussion on guns, and
sure enough, out of it came the
admission that while he hadn’t
held much for automatic shotguns
in the past, Dean Williams thought
perhaps he’d reached the point in
his hunting career where an auto-
matic might improve his bag.

Because the special Remington
gun demanded exact specifications,
Dean Williams’ friends even fi-
nagled the necessary measure-
ments from him. About this time,
Dean Williams began to wonder
why all this sudden interest in his
arm length and his opinions on
automatic shotguns. It didn’t take
his legally-trained mind long to
weigh the evidence and arrive at a

correct verdict, one he kept to him-
self, though.

While Dean Williams may not
have been surprised at receiving a
gun, he was appropriately impress-
ed by the magnificence of the wea-
pon. Every part, both metal and
wood, is hand-tooled of the finest
materials. Sunk into the stock is
a silver medallion, inscribed for
Dean Williams.

“The company put one man,
working day and night, on this gun
for us,’ Morison said. “He did a
wonderful job.”” Morison says the
gun is valued at around $1,300.

The presentation took place in
the faculty lounge of the law school

where 18 of the 34 who gave Dean
Williams the gun were present.

‘All of them wanted to be here,
but they’re spread all over the
United States,”” said Morison. “We
could have gotten hundreds to chip
in on Dean Williams’ gift if there
had been time to get in touch with
all of them.”

A commemorative scroll bears
the signatures of the participants
and this inscription:

“To Clayton E. Williams, Dean,
School of Law, Washington and
Lee University, 1946-1960, Profes-
sor of Law, 1919- , Gentleman and
Inspiring ‘Teacher of the Law, Bird

Hunter and Fisherman Extraordi-
nary.

‘This especially made Reming-
ton automatic shotgun is presented
by the undersigned, who are friends
and grateful former students, to
mark his retirement as Dean and
with the hope that such modern
weaponry will be tolerated as it
increases the bag.”

Dean Williams, obviously pleased
with the gesture and the new gun,
had one observation:

“IT don’t know what Mrs. Wil-
liams is going to say when she finds
out I’ve been involved in a shot-
gun ceremony.’

Kerns Stamp Collection Given to Library

OLLECTING STAMPS is a hobby of
many, but one Washington

and Lee alumnus, George L. Kerns,
14, has gathered a unique collec-
tion of Washington and_ Lee
stamps, which he presented to Mc-
Cormick Library here this winter.

The collection, which includes
seven Bicentennial covers, com-
prises other valuable covers of local
interest, many autographed by fa-
mous American men. The Kerns
collection was exhibited during the
fall at the Kanawha County LI-
brary of Charleston, West Virginia,
before being sent to Lexington.

Philatelists will enjoy the Kerns
collection, which reflects the inter-
ests of the man who compiled it—
Washington and Lee; the United
States Navy; the Polaris submarine,
Robert E. Lee; West Virginia, and
the South. The sub, SSB6o1, car-
ried a first day cover for Navy
veteran Kerns, and the ship’s com-
mander even added his autograph
to make it more valuable.

Among the collection are seven
Bicentennial covers, as follows:

1. First Day (coat of arms), au-
tographs and correspondence.

WINTER 1961

2. First Day (coat of arms), on
both sides of cover.

3. First Day (coat of arms), via
Polaris submarine.

4. First Day (old view of Un1-
versity), President Gaines’ auto-
graph.

5. First Day (composite cachet)
autographed by Lewis A. Pick,
chief of Army Engineers.

6. First Day (composite cachet),
autographs and_ correspondence,
Dr. James Lewis Howe.

7. First Day, mailed in Wain-
wright, Alaska, and sent by dog
team, mail boat, and airplane.

Some others in the collection
given to the University are:

 

 

Robert E. Lee Polaris submarine
cover; ‘Truman Inauguration Day,
January 20, 1949, autographed by
Alben W. Barkley and Chief Jus-
tice Fred M. Vinson; Confederate
Facsimiles (complete set) and
Dietz correspondence; Second In-
augural Parade of Eisenhower-

Proud of
Our Team!

HEN LEE McLaughlin made his

first official appearance at
Washington and Lee as the univer-
sity’s new football coach, there were
only some twenty-five boys on hand
in the old Washington Chapel that
spring day to hear what he had to
say. Even some of that number
weren't really serious about play-
ing football the next fall, but had
come only to see what manner of
man would take on what seemed at
the time a Herculean task of re-
building the Generals’ football
stature.

Much of what McLaughlin had
to say fell on unbelieving ears, even
for those who wanted to believe.
Said McLaughlin, “We’re going to
think in terms of winning them all
next year.” And he said, “I believe
in letting a lot of boys play for me.
Stick with me and you'll play foot-
ball for Washington and Lee.”

At the time, the football Gener-
als seemed to be thinking more in
terms of losing them all. There was
the 0-7 season in 1955, and the 1-7
record in 1956. And the prospect of
letting a lot of boys play didn’t
seem like the way to go about im-
proving on that mark. It was more
a matter, perhaps, of finding the
eleven best players and calling on
them to be iron men.

Even McLaughlin’s unfailing
optimism nearly faltered that next
September when only nineteen
players reported for the first prac-
tice session. There were more later,
but that opening week of practice
was a grim beginning.

But McLaughlin was steadfast to
his remarks of the previous spring.
He did think in terms of winning
them all, and he did let large num-

10

bers of players see action. But re-
sults were slim. The Generals were
0-8, after a promising start of two-
one-point, heartbreaking _ losses.
But, unmistakeably, there was a
new spirit about Washington and
Lee football. McLaughlin — had
made, at least a start.

The next year, the caliber of foot-
ball improved vastly more than the
1-7 record indicates, and the old
Brooklyn “Wait’ll next year!’ was
heard along the Colonnade. Next
year marked more progress, a credit-
able 3-4-1 season and the fast ma-
turing of a bunch of youngsters

who were beginning to show an_

esprit de corps perhaps unmatched
in Washington and Lee athletic
history.

Finally on autumn afternoons of
1960, that year so many had been
waiting for did, at last, come. Be-
sides thinking about winning them
all, the Generals very nearly did
just that. Only a disappointing 8-8
tie with Johns Hopkins marred an
unbeaten 8-0-1 record. And when
McLaughlin’s wave after wave of
Generals took the field, there wasn’t
too much difference in the ability
of the first string or “Blue” unit
boys and those on the third or
“Gold” unit. An average of 35
players participated in virtually
every quarter of action for the Gen-

erals. McLaughlin had developed
team depth that paid off in victories
over Opponents with superior first
teams but no reserves.

Enroute to the first undefeated
season in Washington and Lee foot-
ball since 1914, the Generals re-
ceived nationwide publicity for
their amazing comebacks under
Coach Lee McLaughlin. At sea-
son’s end, one of the Generals, lit-
tle 145-pound junior linebacker
Terry Fohs of Baltimore, became
one of the smallest players in col-
lege football ever to win All-Amer-
ican honors. He was named to the
third team of the Associated Press
Little All-America squad, a _ re-
markable tribute to a remarkable
player.

In Virginia, the Associated Press
revised its All-Star selection process
in order to give recognition to
Washington and Lee players who
heretofore were ineligible for the
AP’s All-Little Eight team. When
the AP All-Virginia Small College
eleven was announced, Fohs, junior
quarterback Steve Suttle and junior
fullback Doug Martin were accord-
ed first team honors. Four others,
including junior guard Tommy
Goodwin, junior tackle Bill Wheel-
er, junior end Ned Hobbs, and
sophomore halfback Charlie Gum-
mey received second-team berths.

We’re Proud of Our Alumni, Too!

O THOSE colleges and _ institu-
“T tions which have inaugurated
the plan, an occupational file has
been of tremendous importance.

Every institution is keenly aware
and very proud of the impact and
influence which her alumni make
on all levels of community and
business life. In this age of compe-
tition, each college points with
pride to the accomplishments of
her alumni as a measure of her
standards and level of attainment.
Washington and Lee guards closely
the thought that, percentage-wise,
we produce an enviable number of
leaders in all phases of economic,
educational, and professional life.
The time is coming when we may
be called upon to prove this point.

A brochure, though not com-
plete, is being compiled for mailing
to you. Categories are being es-
tablished into which our alumni
may be grouped. ‘This information
will be circulated soon and it is of

infinite importance that each alum-
nus complete his questionnaire. Ex-
perience in other colleges indicate
that the system is of little use un-
less there is reached approximately
85% on returns of information. It
is planned to establish broad occu-
pational classification with a nu-
merical system of detailed break-
down. For example:

roo Architecture
105 General
110 Industrial
115 Landscaping
120 Marine

200 Banking

205 General
210 Investment
215 Loan Association, etc.

500 Education

505 Administration
515, College teaching
520 Elementary teaching

The above is given only for explan-

ation. Each alumnus, in addition
to filling out the questionnaire
form, will be asked to check that
classification which in his opinion
best describes his work.

This information when worked
into our IBM data processing sys-
tem will enable the University and
the Alumni Office to produce sta-
tistics for many purposes. A direct-
ory can be published for distribu-
tion to alumni and to business and
professional organizations.

Of course, the value of such in-
formation will depend on _ up-to-
date records. Changes of positions
and classification must be prompt
and accurate. To this end there
must be a new era of liaison be-
tween alumni and the central office.
Everyone must recognize the im-
portance of keeping the Alumni
Office fully informed. It will be a
responsibility which Washington
and Lee men will gladly accept.

 

During the season, Fohs was pick-
ed by the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch as its lineman of the week,
chosen ahead of the state’s big col-
lege stars. A few weeks later, a
second unit fullback, sophomore
Tommy Keesee, was honored by the
same paper as its back of the week,
again picking his performance as
superior to those of the major col-
lege players.

McLaughlin’s turn for recog-
nition came in February when the
Portsmouth, Va., Sports Club hon-
ored him as Virginia football coach
of the year. In his acceptance
speech, McLaughlin told the Tide-
water sportsmen, “I’ve got one of
the best coaching jobs in the coun-
try....and now, I want you to

WINTER 1961

meet the men who have the other
two.’ He proceeded to introduce
his assistants, Boyd Williams and
Buck Leslie, who, emphasizes Mc-
Laughlin, must share in all credit
for the team’s success.

The 1960 season was a splendid
effort on all counts.

Centre fell in the opener, 21-6,
and Dickinson was beaten, 23-6,
for only the team’s second road
victory since 1953. A Homecoming
crowd saw Franklin and Marshall
bow, 38-8, and then the Generals
spoiled Randolph-Macon’s Home-
coming with a 26-3 victory. Before
a Parents’ Weekend gathering, the
Generals tackled poorly, fumbled
often, and had to rely on a heavy
share of good breaks to hold Johns

Hopkins to an 8-8 tie. Injuries side-
lined two of McLaughlin’s three
first left halfbacks, and the boy
transferred from right to left half-
back, sophomore Charlie Gummey,
was the big agent in a 14-7 come-
back win over Hampden-Sydney.
Carnegie Tech bowed next, 6-0, in
rain and cold at Pittsburgh, and
the Generals closed out their home
schedule with a superb 32-8 lacing
of Sewanee, the last team to have
beaten Washington and Lee in
1959.

A week later, with the second
unit scoring all four touchdowns,
the Generals downed Washington
at St. Louis, 28-0, and back home,
the Washington Hall bell saluted
the victors and their patient coach.

Dr. Leonard E. Jarrard was given
the grant for a year-long study of
the effects of X-rays on behavior in

prove helpful in understanding
how radiation exposure may affect
human beings.

Plans call for Dr. Jarrard’s re-

purchase additional equipment for
testing behavorial patterns of rats
after exposure to varied amounts
of radiation. He will begin detailed
work immediately.

Dr. Jarrard hopes his research
will establish ‘“‘a technique that may
prove of value in subsequent rad1-

HE CHANGE IN COMMAND went
“Diimos unnoticed at Washing-
ton and Lee, but for the first time
in thirty-nine years, E. P. “Cy”
Twombly isn’t coaching the Gen-
erals’ swimming team.

The Washington and Lee swim-
mers, who since 1921 made ‘Twom-
bly the most successful of all Gen-
eral coaches, are going right on
winning and just about everyone
assumed that Cy was still in charge.

His successor is Norris Eastman,
T'wombly’s assistant for the past
two years, and like ‘Twombly, a
Massachusetts native who came
South from Springfield College
with a solid background in ath-
letics in general and swimming in
particular.

As for ‘Twombly, no coach ever
turned over his team to a successor
with greater confidence. “This
young fellow is interested in doing
a good job and he has a top-notch
background,” says ‘Twombly of
Eastman. “He was a big help the
past two years, the boys like him,
and if he stays around as long as
I have, he'll probably do better.”

‘T'wombly’s record is 150 wins
against 50 losses. His swimmers won
eight state titles, four Southern
Conference crowns in a row from
1935 to 1938, and in the mid-30’s,
the Generals went five years with-
out losing a dual meet. “Twombly
also had a 6-0 year in 1948-49.

‘Twombly, who at 63 continues as
athletic director and golf coach,
says he decided to give up the swim-
ming job when his sinus condition
became increasingly aggravated by
the high humidity of the indoor
pool, where he would spend an
average of three hours a day. And,
says ‘I'wombly, “I’m getting too old
for the excitement and the pres-
sure of the meets. In golf, Ill just
pick ’em up every four or five holes

16

 

New Coach EASTMAN, left, and star MAYNARD, right, talk things over with “Cy” TwomMBLy.

and not worry so much how things
are going.”

‘The Generals’ standout perform-
er is Elliott Maynard, a 29-year-
old junior from Portland, Me., who
has broken every Washington and
Lee record for the breast-stroke
events and stands a good chance
of winning national honors this
year and next. He finished high in
the Eastern Intercollegiate meet
last year as a sophomore, and both
Twombly and Eastman agree he
has not yet reached his full po-
tential.

The rest of the Generals are
good, solid performers, but none
approach Maynard’s levels of per-
formance.

“That’s been my secret recently,
good depth that has come from
hard work on the part of my boys,”
says ‘I'wombly. “My recent teams
have had far better balance than
any of the good ones back in 1930
when I depended on a handful of
real hotshots to win for me.”

Among those who are continu-
ing to give Eastman depth and ex-
perience are freestylers Charlie
Hart and Charlie Gummey in the
dashes, and Herb Jahncke, a dis-

tance freestyler whose father once
swam for ‘Twombly. All are soph-
omores who won their letters last
season as freshmen. Co-captains Jim
Parker and Maury Purnell are sen-
ior veterans.

There’s Fun for Everyone at °61 Reunions

LASS REUNIONS began at Wash-
C ington and Lee in May, 1955,
with the first convocation of the
25th anniversary class (1930). The
Golden Anniversary (50th) was ad-
ded in May, 1956, and the 4oth an-
niversary class had its first in 1957.
From 1957 to 1960, these three
classes have met annually each
May, and were joined in 1960 with
the first reunion of the 10th anni-
versary class. Such has been the
growth of this popular occasion.

May 5, 6, and 7 has been set as
the appointed time this year, and
once again reunioning alumni will

reign supreme at Washington and
Lee. Probably no more pertinent
question is asked than, “What is
the major impetus that brings an
alumnus back at reunion time?”
There are many and varied rea-
sons, but unquestionably among
the foremost is the joy of renewing
old friendships. Both faculty and
classmates—the comparing of notes,
of families, and the ever-present
reminiscing about the old days—
renew in each heart a spirit that is
hard to define or find elsewhere.
The alumni who attend will leave
with an inner joy and a renewed

sense of pride in their alma mater.

Program outlines have been for-
warded to each member of the re-
union classes. Intertwined with am-
ple opportunity to visit with
friends are a series of events to
bring them up-to-date with the
University’s plans for the future.
It is hoped that all members of
these reunion classes will return the
pre-registration form so that a list
of those classmates who plan to at-
tend can be compiled and circulat-
ed among the class. In this manner
friends can plan to attend and
bring about the best reunion ever!!

student relations at the University
are better than in their native
countries, and that students should
not be forced to attend classes.
The group is composed of An-

thony Antoniades of ‘Thessalonika,
Greece; Peter Turk of Bad Godes-
berg, Germany; and Rienhard
Hroch of Salzburg, Austria, and
they are studying this year under
the auspices of the Fulbright Com-
mission. The three students trav-
eled a combined total of more than
15,000 miles for their year at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Turk, 23 years old, learned Eng-
lish four years ago and is fluent in
three other languages. Antoniades,
20, gained a speaking and writing
knowledge of English some seven
years ago. Hroch has known Eng-
lish for five years, and also speaks
four other languages.

Turk is taking a year’s leave of
absence from his medical studies in
Germany to gain a “more gener-
al knowledge outside of the field of
medicine.” Hroch will resume law
studies upon his return to Salzburg.
Antoniades, a sophomore, expects
to stay here for at least one more
year before transferring to a school
of engineering for completion of
his work in mechanical engineering.

Fancy Dress and F raternity Combos

T-MODEL AND a ‘Thunderbird

both bear the name of Ford,
but the style and performance are
vastly different.

Likewise, the late models of Fan-
cy Dress Ball have been altered to
suit the modern-day tastes of the
students who stage them. And the
weekend now brings many other
kinds of social activities, in addition
to the costumed gala.

Fancy Dress Ball was begun orig-
inally to brighten the dull days be-
tween the end of examinations and
the start of second semester—to of-
fer color and pageantry to quiz-
weary students. And so it did, be-
coming a sort of weekend Mardi
Gras. Young ladies who had never
been invited to attend a Fancy
Dress Ball were not socially solid.
It was the highlight of the year.

The current students, many of
whom have grown up in compara-
tively bountiful times, are accus-
tomed to a multiplicity of choice
when it comes to social affairs. A big
event, such as Fancy Dress, has nec-
essarily hatched a nestful of other
social accompaniments. And_ the
student of the ’sixties, with his
large appetite for conviviality,
participates in as many as possible.

Several changes, of course, have
come about. Fancy Dress weekend
costs more now than formerly; for
instance, rental of costumes is now
up to $16 per couple. Many fra-
ternities have parties, for which
members are assessed; some _ hire
combos for the weekend. And girls
still have to eat often during the
weekend. Some of the University
men without steady girl friends de-
cline to spend this much money on
casual acquaintances, so they don’t
ask a date. Other students have oth-
er problems—like the ones who go
steady with girls at colleges which

18

are unfortunately holding exams Some students contend, too, that
during the Fancy Dress weekend. college restrictions are so tight they

This opulence competes now with... .

 

Above, Fancy Dress owcials and dates poses in the opulent satins and brocades of the

Shakespearean period. Below, Vice-president Nep Ames and date chat with chaperons,

Big Dance Weekend ‘Takes Big Money

can’t have an unfettered good time,
so they don’t attend. Some have

dates but never get near Doremus
gymnasium for the dances: they at-

tend the informal parties at the
fraternity houses and have no need
to don satins and laces.

So Fancy Dress Ball like so many
other things which have changed in
the past 50, 25, even ten years, isn’t
quite the same. Only about half
the student body participates, and
on Saturday night, the wide open
spaces between the dancers are con-
spicuous.

But this year’s Fancy Dress was a
good one. ‘The music was excellent,
played by the ‘Tommy Dorsey band
led by Warren Covington, the Jer-
ry Gray band, and the Dukes of
Dixieland, who gave an afternoon
concert. ‘The costumes were color-
ful. The weather was cold but bear-
able, and, all in all, the fifty-second
Fancy Dress Ball did just what it
was meant to do when it was begun
so many years ago—it offered a wel-
come bright spot between exams
and the spring semester. And the
students of the ‘sixties are making
their own tradition of how Fancy
Dress weekend should be observed.

‘The theme for the Ball this year
was “Shakespeare in the Court of
King James I,” and the figure
dealt with the court of King James
shortly after he ascended to the
British throne in 1603, when
Shakespeare and his players were
made Knights of the Chamber Ex-
traordinary. Dance set vice-presi-
dents and their dates depicted lead-
ing characters in Hamlet, King
Lear, Romeo and Juliet, Anthony
and Cleopatra, Henry IV, and Jul-
ius Caesar.

.... casual dress affairs and flat wallets

Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy, ’21, pro-
fessor of English and a Shakespear-
ian scholar, announced the figure,
and the University’s John Graham
Brass Choir played. Doremus gym-
nasium was decorated along the
lines of the famed Globe Theatre.

 

The Saturday afternoon concert featured the Dukes of Dixieland and informal dress.

Below, the Brothers Four entertained student and dates at a cocktial party in the May-

flower Hotel, on Friday prior to Fancy Dress Ball. The party was given by the Phi Gams
in honor of Fancy Dress president, DON PARTINGTON, Culpeper, Virginia.

“Matching Gift’ Program

By Industry Can Atd

Washington and Lee

O HELP SUPPORT higher educa-
“D Gion, each of the companies
listed here has a “matching gift”
program, working in conjunction
with employees who are alumni.
It’s just as simple as one and one
make two.

While individual companies may
vary in the operating details of
their programs, all are essentially
alike in that they match—usually
dollar for dollar—the contributions
of an alumnus-employee to his col-
lege or university.

If the company you work for is
listed, be sure to notify your em-
ployer when you make your annual
or capital gift to Washington and
Lee. You fill in a short form pro-
vided by your employer, who then
sends an equal amount to the Uni-
versity.

If the company you work for is
not listed, possibly it would be in-
terested in establishing a matching
gift program. Not infrequently a
company wants to help support
higher education, but has not yet
decided how best to do it. The
matching gift principle may be the
answer.

INCE THE CLASS agent letters

went forward two months ago,
the 1960-61 Alumni Fund 1s off to
a running start. Contributions and
number of participants are running
ahead of this same time last year,
but the record reached in the last
full campaign (1957-58) has not
been attained.

The Alumni Fund Council,
which directs the annual giving
plan, is keeping a close eye on two
basic figures: (1) the percentage of
participation, and (2) the average
level of individual giving. It is im-
perative for Washington and Lee
and her future that the alumni
goals be: the broadening of the base
and the raising of the level of in-
dividual gifts.

At this point in the 1960-61
Fund, it is hard to ascertain what
will be the percentage of alumni
contributing. In our last full year
the percentage was 35.3%. Com-
pared with other “like” colleges,
this participation is low. For ex-
ample, Bowdoin, Brown, Swarth-
more, and Williams all registered
over 45%, while Amherst at 62%
and Dartmouth and _ Princeton,
both over 70%, are in the top
bracket on this score.

Our 1960-61 Alumni Fund marks
its reactivation following the mer-
ger with the University Develop-
ment Program. By virtue of the ex-
cellent record of this capital cam-
paign, the interest and devotion
to Washington and Lee has been
enlivened in a large number of al-
umni. It is hoped that this interest
will be further manifested by a
higher percentage of participation
in the Alumni Fund.

Class agents, in addition to their
participation in the fund, render a
tremendous service to our alma
mater. Members of each class have
received letters from their agents
and will, no doubt, receive other
correspondence in the next few
weeks. Regional agents are being
enlisted to supplement the work of

WINTER 1961

the class agents. These men will co-
operate on a personal basis within
their region to urge the full partici-
pation of all alumni. Through the
help of each individually and of all
collectively, the broadening of the
base and the increased percentage
of participation can be assured.

Raising the sights on individual
giving is equally important. Even
at this early point in the fund year,
it 1s determined that the average
gift is approximately $31.55. “Chis
is compared with $33.65 in our last
full alumni fund and with Am-
herst’s $34.00, Davidson’s $41.00,
Princeton’s $51.00, and Sewanee’s
$85.00. When dealing with large
numbers of participants, it is as-
tounding what a great increase can
be realized by a small rise in indi-

vidual giving. Everyone is cogni-
zant of how all items in our every-
day world have gone up in costs.
Colleges are no exception to this
condition. As we all know, raising
the student tuition is not the only
answer. Each alumnus and friend
of the University is urged to look
realistically at this problem and to
give thoughtfully and in_propor-
tion to his concern for Washington
and Lee and its mission as an inde-
pendent educational institution.

Remember that one of the great
strengths of the Alumni Fund lies
in the fact that it is annual giving
upon which the University can de-
pend in planning annual opera-
tions. Support your class and your
alma mater as she deserves through
the 1960-61 Alumni Fund.

Right Around Our Campus

ASHINGTON AND LEE University
W is now the owner of Col Alto,
the historic residence once the
property of the Tuckers in Lexing-
ton. The seventeen-room home,
and surrounding eight acres of
grounds, was willed to the college
by Mrs. Rosa ‘Tucker Mason for use
as a president’s home, or “‘some othe
er non-commercial purpose.”

The deed conveying the owner-
ship was dated September 16, 1957,
but Mrs. Mason was given lifetime
occupancy. She died January 49,
1961. The ‘Tuckers were very
close to the University. Mrs. Ma-
son’s grandfathers, John Randolph
Tucker and Colonel William Pres-
ton Johnston were both members
of the faculty, as dean of the law
school and professor of history, re-
spectively. Her father, Harry St.
George ‘Tucker, succeeded his
father as dean of the law school and
served one year as acting presi-
dent. Her brother, the late John
Randolph ‘Tucker, was a member
of the Board of ‘Trustees.

The 150-year-old mansion is a
two story solid brick building
which contains seventeen rooms,
eight baths, and a full basement.
All household furnishings not
otherwise disposed of by Mrs. Ma-
son in her will became the prop-
erty of the college.

University use of the property
is not yet crystallized, pending legal
matters.

m AN OLD FRIEND of Washington
and Lee University has left the
Lexington scene. Miss Mary Pax-
ton Barclay died November 8, 1960,
at the age of 79. She had been as-
sociated at the college in various
capacities for 47 of those years.
Both her father and grandfather
were members of the University’s

22

Board of Trustees, the elder Alex-
ander Barclay from 1835-39, and
her father from 1885-1915. She
joined the staff in 1913, when the
late Paul Penick, in whose law
office she was secretary, was ap-
pointed treasurer of Washington
and Lee. She served as his secretary
for several years and for a time
was secretary to President Henry
Louis Smith. In 1919, she joined
the staff of the alumni office as
assistant to the alumni secretary.
Before “Cy” Young became alumni
secretary in 1929, she took charge
of all alumni office activities, and
again during his absence in war-
time, from 1942-44, she supervised
alumni work.

Her principal concern for many
years was the Alumni Magazine,
which she edited at times during
the ’20’s, and for which she tra-
ditionally wrote the class notes.

Many Alumni will remember her
in a more personal way, for she
and her sister, Miss Elizabeth, had
student tenants in their large home
one block from the campus.

Miss Mary’s principal outside in-
terest was woodcarving, and many
fraternity houses boast examples
of her fine work. She carved chests
on commission for Mrs. Franklin
D. Roosevelt and Queen Mother
Elizabeth. Her most familiar work
is the University’s ceremonial mace,
which she carved in three months
in 1951 from a design by Dr. Mar-
ion M. Junkin, head of the depart-
ment of fine arts.

A sister of Norris, Tennessee,
and a brother, of Lexington, sur-
vive her. Miss Elizabeth died on
October 23, 1960. The old Barclay
home is currently up for sale, and
many of its furnishings were sold at
auction.

w@ MRS. C. HAROLD LAUCK, assistant
in the Alumni Office for almost
nineteen years, retired January 1,
1961.

A long and faithful employee,
she began her work with the office
during World War II on a part-
time basis. Miss Mary Barclay was
in charge of Alumni activities at
that time. Later, when Alumni Sec-
retary H. K. Young returned from
service, Mrs. Lauck took on full-
time work in the office.

 

Mrs. LAUCK receives silver tray.

She has been invaluable in her
service with the Class Agents’ and
Regional Agents’ solicitation for
the Alumni Fund, as well as gen-
eral operation of the Alumni office.
A luncheon in her honor was held
by employees on January 25 at Vir-
ginia House restaurant, and she was
presented a silver bowl. “The Alum-
ni office presented her a silver tray.

Mrs. Lauck is the wife of the
superintendent of the Journalism
Laboratory Press at Washington
and Lee. ‘They have three children
and seven grandchildren.

Alumni Board Considers Resolutions

N ACCORDANCE with a policy of

keeping alumni informed of
significant action by the Alumni
Board of Trustees, the Magazine
lists the following action taken by
the board at its meeting on October
7, 1960.

The board took under consider-
ation each of the proposed reso-
lutions offered by Dr. Amos L.
Herold, ’cg, in the annual Associa-
tion meeting of June 2, 1960, and
reviewed on pages 22-23 of the
Summer issue of the Alumni Mag-
azine. The decisions of the board
are as follows:

1. Fiscal procedure: the Alum-
ni Board of ‘Trustees, after dis-
cussion, unanimously agreed that
under the present circumstances no
benefit was to be gained by a
change in the fiscal procedure; that
the present procedure appears to
be sound and in the best interest of
both the University and the Asso-

ciation, and accordingly reafhrmed
the resolution of the previous
Board of 1952.

2. Acquisition of Alumni build-
ing: in discussing the matter, the
Board took full cognizance of the
desirability of an alumni _head-
quarters building and reviewed its
previous actions in this connection.
It was the Board’s opinion, how-
ever, (a) that it could not consci-
entiously insist that such a struc-
ture should take precedence over
urgent requirements of the Un1-
versity, (b) that the University
Board of Trustees has such a build-
ing under active consideration in
the overall development plans of
the University, and (c) that actions
of this Board, including the direct-
ing of the solicitations and expen-
ditures of money through the
Alumni Fund, must be in keeping
with the purposes set forth in the

Association’s charter to operate

“for the benefit of Washington and
Lee University.” Accordingly, the
Board unanimously agreed that the
action proposed by this resolution,
namely: to withhold fund balances
from the University for the pur-
pose of expending same on an
alumni headquarters, under the
present circumstances would be
contrary to the spirit of trust im-
posed upon them by the charter.

3. Association budget and audit:
the Board noted that such _pro-
cedure was already being followed
and agreed no further action was
needed on this resolution.

4. Publication of board actions:
the Board in discussing this pro-
posal noted that the minutes of
the Board meetings are “open” to
all alumni and, in the opinion of
the Board, matters of significant
interest are being given appro-
priate publicity. Proposed By-Laws
changes (see number seven below)
will be published in advance in the
Alumni Magazine and the alumni
will be brought up-to-date on all
By-Laws as soon as feasible (see
number ten below).

5. Proxy voting: the Board took
note that voting by proxy had been
tried in the past and found to
be not in the best interest of the
Association and the University. It
is the Board’s obligation to repre-
sent the interest and views of
alumni generally, and in view of
the wide dispersal of alumni of our
University the Board felt that
proxy voting would more readily
tend to militant minority control
than in majority control. The
Board therefore unanimously de-
clined to approve this resolution.

6. Revision of Article VIII: in
considering this the Board unan-
imously agreed that the deletion of
this phrase (By-Law Article VIII
(b) “except as otherwise provided
by action of the Board of Trus-
tees’) would limit the Board, which
has the ultimate responsibility for
carrying on the business and _ pro-

23

 

gram of the Association, and conse-
quently declined to take the action
suggested by the resolution.

7. Tenure of Trustees: the Board
noted that it has, for some time,
had under study the membership
and tenure of the Alumni Board
of ‘Trustees; that such study was
reported to the Association at its
General Meeting in June, 1960.
The proposals under study would
result in greater tenure, as advo-
cated by Dr. Herold, but would
still require a rotating Board. The
committee directing this study ex-
pects to have specific proposals for
presentation to the General Asso-
clation meeting in June, 1961,
with advance publication in the
Alumni Magazine. Accordingly,
the Board agreed to defer action
on the first part of this resolution
until such time as the changes now
under consideration are accepted
or rejected.

8. Bond: the Board took note of
a letter from the Treasurer of the
University advising “This is to
certify that Washington and Lee
University carried a blanket posi-
tion bond with the National Surety
Corporation of New York which
covers the Treasurer of the Un1-
versity and all other employees
who handle any University funds
whatsoever, including
Funds.”

Alumni

g. On Magazine being sent only
to contributors to Alumni Fund:
the Board expressed its opinion
that the worth derived from our
Magazine being sent to all alumni
regardless of their contributions,
lies in the intangible good relations
it brings and unanimously agreed
that the present policy be contin-
ued with no change.

10. Publication of By-Laws: the
Board noted that the publication
of the charter and by-laws is al-
ready under consideration and 1s
awaiting the proposed revisions re-
garding membership and tenure of
the Board of Trustees mentioned

24

in paragraph number seven above.
‘The Board agreed that as soon as
practicable thereafter a publication
of the charter and by-laws would
be effected.

11. Enlargement of Magazine
staff: the Board, after considering
the expense involved and the opin-
ion of its editorial board represen-
tative, concluded that such a move
was not justified at the present

time.

Among other actions the board
(a) approved the Homecoming date
of October 14, 1961 when the Gen-
erals will play Randolph-Macon

men’s college; (b) appointed new
members of the Editorial Board;
(c) approved a resoluiton by the
Alumni Fund Council regarding
the class note section of the Alum-
nt Magazine and took under ad-
visement another resolution by this
same body regarding annual re-
ports of the Association and of
the University; (d) accepted a re-
port from the Memphis chapter
regarding their participation in a
“Seminar for Public Responsibil-
ity’ in their area; and (e) received
a personal report from President
Cole on various aspects of the Uni-
versity.

“We, the members of the academ-
ic class of 1920, at this, the 4oth
year since our graduation from
Washington and Lee Uuniveristy,
pause to pay tribute to our friend
and class-mate, Willis M. Everett,
who departed this life last April
4th at Atlanta, Georgia. ‘To this
end, a committee of members of the
1920 class is hereby named to draft
appropriate resolutions, as follows:

WHEREAS Willis M. Everett had_ be-
come a distinguished and highly-respect-
ed member of the Atlanta Bar, and, as
was his nature, ever championed the caus-
es of the unfortunate and underprivileged,
and was always willing to undertake,
wherever necessary, to defend a_ just
though unpopular cause, and

WHEREAS he served as comissioned
officer with distinction in both World
Wars, and, in 1946, was promoted to the
rank of Colonel, Army Intelligence, and,
while stationed at Nuremberg, Germany,
was assigned to the most difficult and un-
popular defense of his career: viz. the
defense of 74 German officers and troopers
accused of the slaughter of American
and Belgian prisoners during the Battle
of the Ardennes Bulge, otherwise better
known as the “Malmedy Massacre,” and

WHEREAS the fate of these Germans
became, in time, a cause celebre, and the
subject of many articles in the press, both
in the United States and abroad, engend-
ering strong emotions, overwhelmingly in
favor of execution, and

WHEREAS he believed that these Ger-
mans had not had fair trials according
to American notions of due process; that
confessions had been coerced from them,
and documentary evidence in their favor
had been destroyed, and was willing to
accept the challenge of their defense with-
out reservation; further, that he spent
five years of his life and considerable
personal fortune in appeals to save the
lives of these unfortunates, before the
United States Supreme Court and the
Court of International Justice at the
Hague, his efforts resulting in the com-
mutation of death sentences to sentences
of life imprisonment in each instance, and

WHEREAS, we, the members of the
1920 class, take a just pride that Willis
was our Class-mate, and considering that
his untiring efforts reflected much credit
to his alma mater, that this conduct was
in its best traditions, and far beyond the
call of duty,

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLV-
ED, (1) that we, his class-mates, mourn
his untimely death; (2) that, in order that
his services not be forgotten, these reso-
lutions be entered upon the official rec-
ords of his alma mater; (3) that copies
thereof be transmitted to the family of
our class-mate, to the Board of ‘Trustees,
to the Alumni Association, and to Pres-
ident Cole and the members of the Ad-
ministrative Board of Washington and
Lee University, for such further action
as may be considered appropriate.

EXINGTON’S CIGAR-SMOKING Sam

W. Rayder, ’30, has spent more
time in extra-curricular activities
than any Washington and Lee
student—but he’s been at it for 30
years.

The 57-year-old vice president
and trust officer of the Rockbridge
National Bank puts in his time in
the all-important post of Washing-
ton and Lee student body treas-
urer. In this capacity he directly
supervises the expenditure of all
student funds at the university.

Unpaid and often not thanked
for his efforts, Rayder started on his
financial whirl with Washington
and Lee while he was a student
here. He was the first and only
student to serve as student body
treasurer. He held the post his
senior year and ever since.

For twenty-five years, Rayder car-
ried the dual responsibility of the
administration of student body
funds and the keeping of books
for the then fourteen social frater-
nities on campus. He retired as the

fraternities’ financial adviser in 1955
when he was named to his present
position at the bank. He still serv-
es as advisor for his own Sigma Chi,
however.

The most time-consuming por-
tion of the student body treasurer’s
job is the supervision of funds for
campus publications. Rayder hand-
les the budgets for the Calyx, The
Southern Collegian and the Ring-
tum Phi.

Born in the little Arkansas town
of Watson, Rayder came to Lex-
ington in 1924 as a freshman. That
same year he took a job at the
Rockbridge Bank. He obtained his
law degree from the university in
1930.

Rayder’s banking interest stems
from his 15th birthday when he as-
sumed the job of cashier—the only
one in knee pants—of a small coun-
try bank in Desha County, Arkan-
sas. From this little bank he came
to Washington and Lee at the sug-
gestion of an alumnus who was
employed by Little Rock’s W. B.
Northern Private Bank.

Besides being an active layman
in Lexington’s First Presbyterian
Church, Rayder has found time
during the past 30 years to collect
antique autos. At one point he had
a total of six old cars. Commer-
cially, his interest in cars led him
to the presidency of the Rockbridge
Motor Company, a local dealer-
ship.

Some of his active interest in
Washington and Lee student af-
fairs has rubbed off on his family—
at least Sam W. Rayder, Jr. His
18-year-old son is a freshman this
year at his father’s alma mater.
Rayder also has two daughters and
two grandchildren.
