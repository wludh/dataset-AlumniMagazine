Seventy-Five Robert E. Lee
Research Scholars Are Working

With Professors on Projects

In Seventeen Academic Areas

N THE PSYCHOLOGY laboratory in

duPont Hall, a senior performs

a delicate brain operation on a

white rat, while in an adjoining

room, another student clocks oth-

er white rats in their progress
through a simple maze.

Across town, in the privacy of his
own room, a student sits down with
a stack of seldom-opened books
from the recesses of McCormick L1-
brary and prepares to search them
for references to French philoso-
pher Pierre Abelard.

Fifty miles away, in the Roanoke
office of the president of a small
metal fabricating plant, another
Washington and Lee student ques-
tions the older man about the way
he operates his profitable business.

In the physics laboratories of
Washington and Lee’s new science
building, several students patient-
ly set up another attempt to “grow”

9

~

a pure single crystal of zinc in a
high temperature furnace that they
have helped design and build.

Still another student is quietly
but thoroughly poring over a col-
lection of faded letters, most of
them a century old, in the office of
a history professor.

The activities of these young
men are typical of those involving
some seventy-five Washington and
Lee students during the current
academic year. Each is engaged in
a highly specialized area of re-
search, each is working under the
guidance of a professor who is a
trained researcher, and each is per-
mitted a degree of responsibility in
the project that is commensurate
with his training and experience.

Each is either a Robert E. Lee
Research Assistant or a Robert E.
Lee Research Scholar, and both
terms mean distinction on_ the
Washington and Lee campus.

In many instances the student's
project involves research interests
of the supervising professor, in
which case the student serves as a
research assistant or apprentice,
carrying out assignments at the di-
rection of his professor. In other
projects, the research may have
been conceived by the student him-
self, then planned and executed un-
der the supervision of a professor
interested in helping the under-
eraduate.

In virtually every case, the work
of the students and their level of
involvement is comparable with
that undertaken normally only at
the graduate level in pursuit of ad-
vanced degrees. And the close re-
lationships between students and
professors is of a proximity seldom
encountered below the Ph.D. level
in graduate school, University of-
ficials point out.

‘The unusual, perhaps unique, as-
pect of this activity at Washington
and Lee is the fact that such work
is being done on such a large scale
at the undergraduate or bachelor
degree plateau. Few, if any, col-
leges and universities in the United
States have yet undertaken such
a broad program of undergradu-
ate research.

Washington and Lee’s program
is known as the Robert E. Lee Re-
search Program for Undergradu-
ates, and it is now well established
in its third year of operation. ‘The
program is supported by a gift of
more than a quarter of a million
dollars from the late Dr. Gustavus
B. Capito, ‘99, of Charleston, W.
Va., in 1960. This fund was later
augmented by two gifts from the
Charleston Foundation for Re-
search, and under the combined
support, the program has grown
significantly.

Established in the second semes-
ter of the 1960-61 session, the pro-
gram first involved only twenty-five
students in a handful of projects.
By 1961-62, fifty-seven students

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

were active in forty-nine projects.
During the current academic year,
participation has increased even
more. ‘he seventy-five students are
working in fifty-five projects under
thirty-five professors who represent
seventeen academic areas.
Although a large number of pro-
jects concern the natural sciences,
the humanities and social sciences
are well-represented in the pro-
gram, and a University-wide bal-
ance is achieved in application of
the program’s funds. Active with
1962-63 projects are such diverse

Senior chemist ROBERT M.
AUBURN al work on a re-
search study of the ther-
modynamics of fused salt
systems. AUBURN was one
of seventeen Washington
and Lee student research-
ers who presented papers
at the 1963 meeting of the
Virginia Academy of
Science,

fields as accounting, music, sociolo-
gy, linguistics, economics, public
speaking, military science, com-
merce, modern foreign languages,
English, philosophy, history, and
law, as well as the sciences—biolo-
gy, chemistry, geology, physics, and
psychology.

Dean of the College, Dr. William
W. Pusey III, under whose direc-
tion the program operates, expects
student and faculty interest to in-
crease still further, to a point where
the limited funds available for the
program will place student appli-
cants in a highly competitive sit-
uation.

The overall purpose of the pro-
gram is to present undergraduates
with an opportunity to work close-

ly with professors in meaningful

SPRING 1963

research projects that will acquaint
the students with the tools, tech-
niques, and methodology of schol-
arly and scientific investigation.

A principal benefit of the pro-
gram is the stimulus given to the
intellectual curiosity of the stu-
dents. ‘The
pected to encourage participants

program can be ex-

to go on to graduate school and fu-
ture careers as teachers, scholars,
and scientists. Even for students
who do not intend to pursue grad-
uate work, participation in the pro-
gram 1s rewarding and challenging.

Willard R. Young III of Leban-
on, N. J., is a senior who expects
to follow a banking career. His
Robert E. Lee project—one he de-
vised himself with the assistance of
Commerce professor Dr. Lewis K.
Johnson—is a study of the opera-
tion of small metal fabricating
plants within a seventy mile radius
of Lexington. Young feels that a
grasp of problems of small business-
men and industrialists will help
him in his future career as a bank-
er in a city of modest size.

James W. McBride of Hilton
Head, S.C., will study German in
the University of North Carolina’s
graduate school next year. His as-
sistance to Philosophy professor Dr.
Paul C. Hayner in compiling a
bibliography on Abelard will give

him valuable training for a_ task
he is sure to encounter as a gradu-
ate student.

No Robert E. Lee Research Pro-
eram participants receive academ-
ic credit for their work, nor do they
feel that this kind of program
should involve grades and credit.
R. Meade Christian, Jr., of Rich-
mond, the 1963 valedictorian who
assists Biology professor Dr. Lyman
R. Emmons in a project in cytoge-
netics, feels the Lee program offers
undergraduates a unique relation-
ship with professors.

 

“T think it ts good for students
to work with their professors and

not be concerned with getting an
‘A OF a Bas a-result,” says Chris-
tian. “It’s a real change of pace for
me to work with Dr.
share his excitement and his enthu-
disappointments.
This program encourages students

Emmons,
slasm—and his

to do things on their own, and for
me, it has been excellent technical
training for my future work in
medical school.”

For all of the undergraduate par-
ticipants, the program means es-
sentially a form of very beneficial
campus
Each student agrees to devote a
given number of hours during a
semester to his work, for which he
is compensated at a rate of $1.35 to

part-time employment.

Q
ao

 

 

 

 

 

 

$1.50 per hour, depending upon his
experience. But, as a campus job,
a research appointment has import-
ant advantages other than the mod-
est income it provides for its recip1-
ents. When the program was first
announced, the New York Times
commented this way:

“di he
wishes to work his way through

undergra duate wha

college is generally faced with a
choice among menial and non-
academic jobs that have little re-
lation to the higher education he
is seeking. A recent gift to Wash-
ington and Lee University, how-
ever, will make it possible for

talented students to engage in

projects for pay, in-

stead of waiting on

research
tables or
shelving library books. The fi-
nancial aid is not designed to
underwrite honors work, but to
enable the student to earn his
way by a means that has educa-
tional value.”

If students are the prime bene-
ficiaries in the Robert E. Lee pro-
gram, there are benefits for profes-
sors, too, Dean Pusey points out.
They have an opportunity to work
closely with highly motivated and
highly interested students, of the
type usually found only in grad-

uate school. Professors are encour-
aged to undertake the kind of re-
search projects that can involve stu-
dent assistants in meaningful work,
and Robert E. Lee funds are avail-
able for the purchase of equipment
and materials essential to projects
which do involve students.

Professors are enthusiastic about
the program, and they agree that
it has an important future at Wash-
ington and Lee. Dr. Samuel J. Ko-
zak of the Geology department has
two students working on two dif-
ferent projects now, but he antici-
pates expanded use of student as-
sistants in the future. “If I can be-
gin training selected students as
sophomores, by the time they are
seniors we can have a really im-
portant research team functioning
in geology,” he points out.

Science professors are especial-
ly proud of the number of papers
presented each year by Washington
and Lee research participants at
the Virginia Academy of Science.
Virtually no papers are presented
from other colleges by undergrad-
uate students at the academy’s an-
nual meeting.

In addition to the knowledge
they acquire of research tools and
techniques, Washington and Lee’s
researchers learn of other import-
ant attributes of the successful
scholar or scientist. Says Robert M.
Auburn, a senior pre-medical stu-
dent from Falls Church, Va., “You
learn to be patient, to work hard
without dramatic re-
sults at every turn. When I was in-
terviewed by Duke Medical School,
the doctors there were impressed, I

expecting

think, with my understanding of
the patience that research and _ ad-
vanced study requires.” Auburn
was accepted at Duke, and will en-
roll there in the fall.

George K. Taylor, a junior from
Orange, Va., has found that the re-
searcher can encounter many blind
alleys, even in the most fundament-
al of investigations. ‘Taylor wants

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

to build pipe organs as a profession,
so when the Lee Chapel restoration
got underway, he took on a study
of the Chapel’s Erben organ which
also was to be restored. For one
thing, he wanted to know who par-
ticipated in the dedication pro-
gram in 1872. But the Lexington
Gazette of that day offered little
help: “The participants are so well
known locally that it is unnecessary
to list them here,” it reported. Tay-
lor has continued the search dili-
gently but with little success.

Some of the students achieve al-
most total involvement in their re-
search. William M. Durrett, an At-
lanta senior, has acquired a_ sur-
geon’s skill in his work with Dr.
Leonard E. Jarrard’s white rats,
used by the professor in a number
of psychology — studies. Durrett
keeps a sleeping bag in his labora-
tory, works late and gets early
starts. He is so interested in the ex-
periments that he hopes to return
next year as a special student to
continue his assistance to Dr. Jar-
rard.

An attractive feature of the Rob-
ert E. Lee program is an opportunt-
ty for the young scholars in various
fields to share a part of their ex-
perience with their student col-
leagues and professors. Dean Pusey
is host each year at a series of
small dinners at which the pro-
eram participants bring short oral
reports on the work they have been
doing and of their reaction to the
program itself.

“They all have a contagious en-
thusiasm,”” says Dean Pusey, who
adds, ““My enthusiasm for the pro-
eram continues undiminished.”

Directing the program is a job
Dean Pusey does with vigor. Part
of its administration involves con-
siderable bookkeeping on the part
of Dean Pusey’s secretary, Mrs. Faye
Lowry. Among many other im-
portant duties connected with Lee
research, she helps ascertain wheth-
er a student qualifies as a Robert

SPRING 1963

E. Lee Research Assistant or a Rob-
ert E. Lee Research Scholar. It
takes a “C” average for participa-
tion at all, but if an applicant has
a ‘‘B” average, he gains the “‘schol-
ar’ designation.

Dean Pusey remarks that parti-
cipation in the program involves
certain status among serious. stu-
dents. He says they see in the pro-
gram an opportunity to make a
contribution to their own educa-
tions and to the University.

President Cole is pleased with
the progress of the Robert E. Lee
program to date, but he is hopeful
that its influence can be broaden-
ed. President Cole also is hopeful
that projects can be undertaken in
the sciences and other disciplines

that will continue throughout the

summer months, thus making
worthwhile use of university facili-
ties that otherwise stand idle dur-
ing the normal vacation period.
‘The University’s new science facil-
ities all have special provisions for
student research.

Expansion of the program along
these lines will require additional
resources, but University officials
are hopeful that such help will be
forthcoming. Washington and Lee
is exercising outstanding leadership
in the freld of undergraduate re-
search, and the success of the pro-
eram to date is encouraging, not
only to the University, its profes-
sors, and students, but to many
others as well.

A view of a portion of
the new language lab-
oratory, with students
seated in private sec-
lions and instructors
on duty at the master
console behind the
Class.

 

New 42-Booth Electronic Laboratory

Aids Students’ Foreign Language Study

Wi Washington and Lee’s new

electronic language laboratory
went into use early in the second
semester this year, one of the first
lessons students learned was how to
say “No Smoking” in five foreign
languages.

Amid the tape recorders, micro-
phones, and master console costing
thousands of dollars were six, col-
orful, carefully hand-lettered wall
signs. Five say “No Smoking” in
French, German, Italian, Russian,
and Spanish; the sixth, obviously
for beginning language students,
is in English.

The signs serve an important
purpose, according to Prof. B.
Stuart Stephenson, assistant pro-
fessor of German and coordinator
of the language laboratory. Micro-
phones and other electronic gear
located in the forty-two student
booths and the master console are
extremely sensitive and could be
damaged by smoke in the. air,

Stephenson explains. His colleague,
German instructor David B. Dick-
ens, lettered the laboratory signs.

‘The laboratory, available for in-
struction in all the foreign lan-
guages offered at Washington and
Lee, is housed in a large converted
classroom in the — university’s
duPont Hall. The laboratory is
open daily and Sunday nights for
class instruction, study and review.

Half of the laboratory’s booths
are equipped with individual tape
recorders for students’ use, and
each student booth has a micro-
phone and earphones, plus accom-
panying controls. All the booths
may be controlled from the instruc-
tor’s console, and it is possible to
teach four classes at the same time.
Normally, not more than two
classes—relatively small conversa-
tion sections—use the laboratory
simultaneously, Prof. Stephenson
noted.

‘The instructor, through switches
at his console, is able to monitor a
selected student during a class per-
iod without disturbing the work of
the entire class. Corrections, daily
quizzes, and other types of class
work may be accomplished on a
full class or individual _ basis
through the master console. ‘The
master unit itself has three tape re-
corders and a phonograph for trans-
mitting professionally-made tapes
and records or those made by in-
structors. ‘he teacher’s microphone
enables him to speak to the class
or to individual students.

Language laboratories have be-
come a common feature in most col-
leges and many high schools in re-
cent years. Washington and Lee’s
installation has grown from a small
console-listening unit given by a
student’s father in 1960. The ini-
tial unit still sees service in an-
other room in duPont Hall.

“A laboratory of this type can

 

SPRING 19683

 

be a highly efficient teaching meth-
od,” Prof. Stephenson observed. “It
certainly stimulates enthusiasm in
the students.”

Some language students are asked
to purchase their own reels of tape
for study. The student-owned tapes
serve as the basis for “comparison
recording.” For this type of study
exercise, the student records trans-
missions from the master console,
plays them back, listens and records
his repetitions. After class, the stu-
dent is able to listen to his repeti-
tions and compare them with the
instructor’s recording to increase his
language fluency. “The laboratory
furnishes other tapes for student
use.

Language professors at Wash-
ington and Lee are especially en-
thusiastic about using the labora-
tory’s facilities for introducing stu-
dents to plays, operas, novels and
poetry of other languages and cul-
tures.

Daily operation of the labora-
tory is handled by three student
assistants working under the aus-
pices of the university's under-
graduate Robert E. Lee Research
Program. Junior Robert Brewer,
Jr., sophomore ‘Tim Vanderver and
freshman Philip Manor currently
are Prof. Stephenson’s assistants.
The laboratory assistantships are
to be awarded annually to the top
applicants regardless of the aca-
demic department in which they
are majoring.

The students keep tabs on the
working order of the equipment,
catalogue tapes and records, set up
recorders and other instruments for
class sessions. Whenever needed,
they are on hand during class peri-
ods to aid instructors. One of the
assistants’ primary duties is helping
fellow students in using laboratory
equipment during after-class hours.
Actual maintenance of the facili-
ties is handled by Roanoke sound
specialists who installed the equip-
ment.

Although Professor Kitto’s  dis-

One Thousand Regional Agents
Ready To Aid Alumni Fund

OME ONE THOUSAND Washington
S and Lee Alumni, all of them
supporters of the 1952-63 Alumni
Fund; have launched a home
stretch effort to solicit the help of
the more than 7,000 former stu-
dents who have not responded to
the current campaign appeal.

One hundred = alumni
agreed to serve as regional agents
during the phase of the annual
fund drive that emphasizes contact
with prospective contributors ac-
cording to areas of residence. ‘The
regional campaign is designed to
complement and support the work
accomplished by the Class Agents
who have contacted all alumni
through academic and law class
rolls.

have

The names of the one hundred
regional agents appear on the in-
side back cover of this magazine
issue. Each has recruited a corps of
co-workers, averaging about ten
men per agent, thus making up a
group of workers nearly a thousand
strong.

If you are among those who have
not yet responded to the 1962-63
Alumni Fund appeal, chances are

Response by Alumni Donors
Boosts Fund Over $100,000 Mark
For ‘Tenth Time in History; _

Participation Goal Is Far Short

that one of the regional represen-
tatives will be calling soon. In
many cases, he will be a friend or
neighbor. In all cases, he will be a
dedicated alumnus of Washington
and Lee, willing to give of his time
and efforts in an undertaking that
is important to you as an alumnus
and to your University.

As the regional agents and their
helpers begin their work, there is
a strong incentive for them to per-
form a thorough and effective job.
As of mid-April, the 1962-63 contri-
butions to the Fund have totaled
$101,932.54. The goal of $115,000
established last fall by Chairman
Don Fergusson’s Alumni Fund
Council is definitely in reach. In
fact, it could be substantially sur-
passed if the expected good results
from the regional campaigns ma-
terialize.

The results of the Fund appeal
are significant in many ways this
year. The current total marks only
the fourth time that alumni have
exceeded the $100,000 mark in
their giving through the annual
Fund. In 1956, the first time this
level was reached, the total was
$100,931.31; IN 19547, it was $102,-

461.26; and in 1958, the total was
a record high of $113,681.79, which
included a substantial amount ear-
marked for the Cy Young Scholar-
ship Fund. There followed the suc-
cessful University Development
Program for capital funds and the
subsequent suspension of the Al-
umni Fund as such for a period of
two years. ‘The results of the cur-
rent year reflect a gradual reestab-
lishment of the Fund over a four
year period, beginning in 1960.

As encouraging as the prospect 1s
for a record Fund year, there is a
discouraging note, too. This  in-
volves the number of alumni con-
tributors who are making this ban-
ner year possible. ‘The Alumni
Fund was openly ambitious when
it set a participation goal of 100 per
cent, but council members were
convinced that the efforts should be
directed toward all Washington
and Lee men, not just an arbitrary
fraction.

As of mid-April there have been
2,647 contributors to the Fund.
During the 1956-58 Fund years, the
number of contributors totaled
3,363 1n 1956, 3,369 In 1957, and
3,378 in 1958. It is obvious that the

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

current Fund finds fewer contribu-
tors giving more, a response that in-
dicates that many alumni are in-
creasing their level of support as
their capabilities increase. This is
good, for increased giving is one of
the goals sought by the Council,
but there 1s another goal that is of
equal importance.

This goal deals with those alum-
ni who have yet to support any
annual Fund, or those who give in-
termittently or infrequently. The
concern here is not how much a

person gives, but the simple act of
responding itself. Response can be
only a token gift, but it can be a
thoughtful gift, one that express-
es—however modestly—the former
student’s continuing interest in the
University he attended. Many col-
leges and _ universities—generally
those with which Washington and
Lee men like to compare their Uni-
versity—achieve fifty to seventy-five
per cent participation in their an-
nual alumni fund drives. Wash-
ington and Lee’s participation is

now approximately twenty-five per
cent, and the Alumni Fund Coun-
cil is hopeful that a significant
trend upward may start this year.

First letters back from those al-
umni who have received their Lee
Chapel nails express pleasure and
gratitude for this impressive sym-
bol of their support of Washing-
ton and Lee.

If you haven’t registered your
support of your University through
a contribution to the
Fund, won’t you do it now?

Profiles of Your Officers

Outstanding Leadership During 1962-63

Has Meant

N ARTICLE in the Winter issue
Avo the Alumni Magazine stress-
ed the essential need for the con-
tinued high quality of leadership
which the Association has produced
year after year.

In this issue, it seems appropri-
ate—while their terms of office are
still effective—to recognize the ex-
cellent officers who have directed
the Association’s activities during
the current year.

‘The year 1962-63 has been an
important one in alumni. affairs!

The Alumni Fund was reactivat-

President

ed on a full-scale basis. Supported
enthusiastically by the Alumni
Board of ‘Trustees, the Alumni
Fund Council, under Chairman
Donald M. Fergusson, has conduct-
ed a vigorous effort that already has
scen the 1961-62 level of giving sur-
passed. ‘Phere is high optimism
among members of the Council and
the Board that the goal of $115,000
will be reached, perhaps exceeded,
by the close of the fund year.
From the Lee Chapel restora-
tion, the Association obtained sev-
eral thousand hand-forged nails
used in the original construction.

Progress for the Association

‘These have been mounted as at-
tractive desk pieces and are being
sent to all alumni who demonstrate
an active concern for the future of
the University.

‘Lhe 1962-63 officers were the first
to preside over an enlarged Alumni
Board of ‘Trustees. The twelve-
member size permits broader rep-
resentation of alumni and contri-
butes to the vitality of the Associa-
tion through more effective use of
the leadership capabilities of its
members.

The Association itself is growing

m IN 1961 RODNEY M. COOK caused the city of Atlanta

to do an about-face, for he was the first Republican
elected to Atlanta’s Aldermanic Board since 1876.
Effective work as a member of the Fulton County
Republican Executive Committee, as chairman of the
Fulton County Republican Planning Committee, and
as vice-president of Fulton County Young Republican
Club was rewarding for Mr. Cook politically; unselfish
service as a charter member of the St. James Metho-
dist Church, as a member of its Board of Stewards, and
as a former Scout Master and manager of a Little
League ‘Team is rewarding for Mr. Cook personally.
The founder and owner of the Rodney M. Cook In-
surance Agency and a Certified Life Underwriter, Mr.
Cook was born and reared in Atlanta and married the
former Bettijo Hogan of Atlanta. ‘Their three children
are incentives to much of Mr. Cook’s interests in such
varied activities. His acceptance of the first vice-presi-
dency of the well-known Atlanta Civil War Round

Table shows another facet of Mr. Cook’s personality
and of his ability to give inspirational leadership in

various fields.

during the current year. New
chapters have been estabished at
Little Rock, Ark., and Beckley, W.
Va. ‘There is new, enlarged activi-
ty apparent in many areas of long-
standing chapter organization.
The chapters are being visited
by a broad representation of Uni-
versity officials. President Cole,
Deans Pusey, Adams, Light, At-
wood, and Farrar, and many pro-

fessors have appeared before chap-
ter meetings, bringing first-hand
reports on new developments at
Washington and Lee.

Last fall, one of the biggest turn-
outs of alumni in memory was re-
corded at Homecoming. Prospects
are bright, as of this writing, for
another banner year of class anni-
versary reunions.

Further progress was made to-

 

@ TENNIS FOUR DAYS A WEEK, barring bad weather, fig-
ure skating at the ice rink of the Cleveland Skating
Club, working on the Bronze dance test--these activi-
ties reveal John Battle as the man of diversified inter-
ests that he is. Furthermore, when the weather is really
bad, the American Revolution comes in for a studious
going-over. Following participation in the campaigns
of Guadalcanal and Bougainville, attached to the
Marine duty of the Navy Medical Corps, Dr. Battle be-
came associated with the department of internal medi-
cine of the Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic, and he is now
Head of the Department of Hematology of this clinic.
A Fellow of the American College of Physicians and
Diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medi-
cine, he is presently President of the Ohio Society of
Internal Medicine. Dr. Battle married the former Lau-
retta Warwick of Philadelphia. ‘They have a daughter
living on the West Coast and a son starting his sopho-
more year at Hamilton College in New York.

two boys and two girls, seemingly encourage both Al-

to many phases of Shreveport life. Mr. Sartor is presi-
dent of the board of trustees of Southfield School, a
private elementary school. ‘The executive committee
of the Community Council, the Comunity Chest, the
council of Family and Children’s Services—all call
upon Mr. Sartor for his valued experience and judg-

Boyp H. LEYBuRN, JR., is assistant man-

Rep. Bill Brock, Tennessee Republican Winner

= WILLIAM E. BROCK, IJ, 53, thinks
there’s a chance for the two-party
system in the South.

So the Brock Candy Company
heir from Chattanooga, with no
expermence, deteated a
promising New Frontiersman and

political

became the first Republican elected
to the House of Representatives
from his district in 42 years. (He
is one of two Washington and Lee
alumni serving freshman terms as
Congressmen this year. John O.
Marsh, Jr., ’51, a Democrat, was
elected from  Virginia’s Seventh
Congressional District.)

Brock, 32, decided in January,
1g62, to run against the conserva-
Rep. ales: oe
Frazier, Jr., a Democrat who had
been in Congress since 1949. When
Frazier was beaten by the liberal
Wilkes ‘I. Thrasher in the party

primary, it became an all-out bat-

tive incumbent,

tle between two opposing philoso-
phies of government in the Novem-
ber balloting.

Using a borrowed but effective
political technique, Brock enlisted
his entire family as campaign work-
ers. A younger brother, Paul K.
‘Pat’ « Brock; an. alumnus of the
class of ’54, became his campaign
manager.

Having no political experience,
Brock relied on his know-how
gained in working for the family

business—he went at his campaign
as if he were selling candy. Be-
ginning with twenty-five helpers,
he wound up with 4,000. “If you
haven’t got a sales force you won't
get the product off the shelf,” Brock
says.

In a district where Republicans
hadn’t fielded a candidate in two
previous elections, the final vote
was 47,499 for Brock and 45,390 for
‘Thrasher.

Brother Pat suggests that the
GOP can make other significant
Southern gains. “The primary rea-
son the average Southern voter

 

hasn’t identified with the Republh-
can Party,” he says, “is that he has
no reason to. By having a good can-
didate, and putting out the effort,
it can be done in any area in the
South.”

“T kept trying to say,” Bill Brock
recalls, “that I was nobody’s can-
didate but the people’s.”

He served in the Navy from 1953
to 1956 with the rank of lieutenant
(j-g.) and is a member of the Navy
Reserve (Ready) with the rank of
lieutenant. In addition to his busi-
ness activities, he has served numer-
ous Clvic organizations in Chatta-
nooga and has served as a Sunday
School teacher and as a member of
the Christian Education Council of
the Lookout Mountain ‘Tennessee

six months.
