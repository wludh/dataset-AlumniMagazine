President Cole’s graduation remarks stressed the vital need for con-

ARL STANSBURY MATTINGLY, © Mr.
Matt” to generations of Wash-
ington and Lee alumni and a mem-
ber of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s administrative staff for lorty-
nine years, retired July 1 as treas-
urer and secretary of the Univer-
sity.

Mattingly, whose tenure at Wash-
ington and Lee spanned the admin-
istrations of four presidents, will
continue to serve the University as
special adviser to President Cole.

The University’s Board of Trus-
tees, which accepted his notice of
retirement with regret at its reg-
ular meeting in May, designated
Mattingly as treasurer and_ secre-
tary, emeritus.

First announcement of Matting-
ly’s retirement was made by Pres-
ident Cole before the final general]
faculty meeting on June 2. Presi-
dent Cole said he would appoint
a faculty committee to draft an ap-
propriate resolution in honor of
the retiring administrator.

President Cole added: “I know
of no one who has been more loy-
al, more dedicated to the best in-
terests of this University, and |
know of no one who has been a
greater friend to generation after
generation of Washington and Lee
men.”

A native of Washington, D. C.,
Mattingly enrolled at Washington
and Lee in 1916, following attend-
ance at Randolph-Macon Academy
at Front Royal, Virginia. It rep-
resented a late start on his college
education, for Mattingly spent his
early years working days and at-
tending only night school, where he
specialized in business studies.

From his first employment, Mat-
tingly recalls, he has been involved
with the handling of funds. He was
a timekeeper and payroll clerk for
a construction company, then a bill
clerk and later office manager for a
wholesale company, and later a
bookkeeper and teller for a build-
ing and loan association.

His experience in building and

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

loan negotiations helped bring him
to Washington and Lee. ‘Through
a friend, Dr. Ernest Lee Woolf,
Methodist pastor in Lexington in
1916, Mattingly learned of the pos-
sibility of part-time employment in
the Washington and Lee ‘Treasur-
er’s office, which would permit him
to work simultaneously toward his
college degree.

Mattingly became a student as-
sistant in the treasurer's office alter
his first year examinations at Wash-
ington and Lee. His experience and
service were particularly valuable
because all of the University’s en-
dowment at that time was invested
in real estate loans.

Mattingly left college to serve
in the medical corps and in field
artillery officer’s school during
World War I, returning in January,
1gig, tO assume management of the
University’s dining hall. Later that
year he renewed his work in the
treasurer's office, and in 1920 he
was appointed registrar of the Uni-
versity although he was still an
undergraduate.

As registrar he continued to study
part time, and in 1925 he qualified
for his A.B. degree. He continued
as registrar for twenty years until
1940 when he was appointed the
University’s first full-time treasurer
and secretary.

An article in the University’s
alumni magazine recounted _ his
work as registrar this way:

“The efficiency with which his
othce was carried on has become al-
most proverbial; his memory for
students’ names and faces is well-
known to be amazing, while his
popularity with them is deserved.”

Mattingly recalls that he made
a point to memorize the name, face,
hometown, local address, and
grades of every Washington and
Lee student, about 600 to 700 year-
ly during the 1920’s and 1930's.

In his work as treasurer, Matting-
ly helped guide the University
through the difficult World War

dled and the University turned
over its facilities to the Army’s
School
represented the University in all

for Special Services. He
negotiations and relationships with
the government and Army. Later,
when the war ended, he supervised
the handling of government rela-
tions and funds in connection with
the hundreds of veterans who en-
rolled under the “GI Bill of
Rights.”

A bachelor, Mattingly made
Washington and Lee his major con-
cern but not his exclusive interest.
He was a charter member of the
Lexington Kiwanis Club and a
charter member of the Rockbridge
Historical Society. He is a Mason
and a Shriner.

Mattingly studied voice as a
young man, and for many years he
was in great demand as a soloist
with church choirs and at wed-
dings. He was one of the founders
and first president of the Trouba-
dours, Washington and Lee’s dra-
matic club.

He served as a member of the
first board of directors of Lexing-
ton’s Stonewall Jackson Hospital,
and he continues as a trustee of
the Stonewall Jackson Memorial
Cemetery. From 1958 to 1964 he
was a trustee of Randolph-Macon
Academy. He is former treasurer of
Lexington’s Robert E. Lee Mem-
orial Episcopal Church, and con-
tinues as chairman of its board of
trustees. He has served also several
times as a member of the execu-
tive board of the Diocese of South-
western Virginia.

Mattingly is a member of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, national honor-
ary leadership fraternity; Beta
Gamma Sigma, national society
recognizing achievement in business
and commerce; and Phi Delta ‘The-
ta social fraternity.

Retirement will work no major
changes in his pattern of living,
Mattingly says, for his role as pres-
idential adviser will mean regular

 

The Board’s Resolution

mw IN ACCEPTING Mr. Mattinglys retirement, the
Trustees adopted a resolution for inclusion in the official!
minutes of the Board. The resolution declared:

“Earl S. Mattingly has served Washington and Lee Uni-
versity with unequalled devotion and distinction for forty-
nine years. His wise management and unswerving loyalty
have been of inestimable value to the University. By this
resolution the Board of Trustees, on behalf of its individual
members and of the University, expresses its deep sense of
appreciation for Mr. Mattingly’s distinguished record ol
service and its gratification that his experience, wisdom, and
friendship will continue to benefit the University, the presi-
dent, and the members of the board in the years ahead.”

At the Board’s August meeting, Dr. Huston St. Clair, on
behalf of his colleagues, directed Mr. Mattingly to sit for
a special portrait which will be placed in Evans Dining Hall.

call ever having taken a real va-
cation from his work at Washing-
ton and Lee, athough he did attend,
as deputy, three meetings of the
General Convention of the Episco-
pal Church.

His work and his great interest in
the University has involved him
in its routine at virtually every
level. Some of his associates recount
this story as typical of Mattingly’s
ability to apply himself simultan-
eously to many problems:

to his ofhce to receive transfer of a
gift of a quarter of a million dol-

Other Administrative
Changes Follow

Mr. Mattingly’s Retirement

HE RETIREMENT Of Earl S. Mat-
divas set in motion a series of
administrative adjustments designed
to assure continued efficiency in the
University’s administration. Some
adjustments were directly related to
Mattingly’s area of former responsi-
bility, while others were concerned
with separate administrative func-
tions.

In addition to the Treasurer’s
Office and the fiscal procedures of
the University, other areas affected
included the Board of Trustees, the
College, the Registrar’s office, the
ofhce of student financial aid, and
general administrative activities
now handled by an Office of Uni-
versity Services.

Changes and additions in per-
sonnel were accompanied by some
reallocation of office space.

James W. Whitehead, Assistant
to the President for Administration
and Director of University Services,
was named by the Board of Trus-
tees to succeed Mr. Mattingly as
University Treasurer, while contin-
uing to serve as an assistant to Pres-
ident Cole.

Robert E. R. Huntley, ’52, Pro-
fessor of Law and the University’s
legal adviser, was chosen to assume
Mr. Mattingly’s responsibilities as
Secretary to the Board of Trustees.

Andrew B. Varner, Assistant
‘Treasurer, was promoted to Chief
Accountant and Director of Finan-
cial Services.

Two other appointments to new-
ly created administrative positions

SUMMER 1966

were announced by President Cole.

L.. Vernon Snyder, '49, was named
Director of University Services, a
new job involving him in the direc-
tion of University purchasing and
supplies, ofhce and personnel serv-
ices, student and faculty housing
assignments, and supervision of the
dining hall, supply store, and new
paperback book store.

Dr. William J. Watt, Professor of
Chemistry, was appointed Assistant
Dean of the College and will work
with Dean William W. Pusey, III,
in the general administrative pro-
cesses of the College.

The creation of the positions now
filled by Snyder and Dean Watt
was recommended in the course of
the University’s Self-Study, now ap-
proaching the conclusion of its two-
year project.

The new titles and responsibili-
ties were assumed by Mr. White-
head, Mr. Huntley, and Mr. Varn-
er, on July 1, while Mr. Snyder be-
gan his new duties on July 15 and
Dr. Watt on August 1.

The previously announced ap-
pointment of Harold S. Head as
University Registrar became effec-
tive July 1, as Head assumed the
position held by Edwin H. Howard,
who retired at the end of the 1965-
66 academic year.

Also effective on August 1 was
the appointment of Farris P. Hotch-
kiss, 58, as Assistant Dean of Stu-
dents and Director of Financial
Aid. Hotchkiss succeeds Lewis G.

John, ’58, who has taken a two-year
leave of absence to continue grad-
uate study toward his doctorate at
Syracuse University.

Physical adjustments necessary to
accommodate the personnel changes
involved complete interior remodel-
ing of the small building located
directly behind Washington and
Robinson Halls. Constructed dur-
ing World War II to serve as a din-
ing hall for Army personnel attend-
ing special schools on the campus,
the building has undergone a com-
plete interior redesign to accom-
modate the Registrar’s office as well
as the University’s computer center
and machine records office.

When completed, the new fa-
cilities will provide greatly needed
additional space for work of the
Registrar's office, storage of official
student records, expanded area for
data processing equipment, and
new quarters for the Model 1620
computer. The building will also
contain a classroom for use by stu-
dents studying computer program-
ming, and it will have offices for the
chairman of the faculty computer
committee and the supervisor of
data processing.

The Office of University Services
has taken over office space on the
first floor of Washington Hall form-
erly occupied by the Alumni Of-
fice, prior to its move to the new
Alumni House. Mr. Mattingly has
been relocated in the office former-
ly used by the Alumni Secretary,

5

 

having vacated the Treasurer's ol-
fice for occupancy by Mr. White-
head.

In the Treasurer’s Office, exten-
sive remodeling was done to pro-
vide better functional organization
and to provide for the addition of
new bookkeeping and data proces-
sing equipment.

Dean Watt and Mr. Huntley will
have offices on the second floor of
Washington Hall, with Dean
Hotchkiss occupying Dean John’s
former office there.

No plans have been announced
for the use of space to be vacated
by the Registrar's Office in the con-
necting wing between Washington
and Payne Halls.

LONG A BUSY VIRGINIA HIGHWAY,
ye a group of people are chip-
ping away at roadside rock with
small pickaxes.

lonoring the traffic rushing be-
hind them, each person pounds at
the rock walls, and then one picks
up a fragment and calls the others
over. “Ooos” and “aahs” are heard
as the rock is examined.

A passing motorist screeches his
car to a halt and inquires:

“What are you looking for?”

“Rocks,” is the answer.

Unbelieving, the motorist drives
a few feet farther and asks another
rock-chipper the same question.

“Fossils,” is the reply this time.

The motorist scratches his head
and drives on.

Forty miles away, a group of
students sits in a college classroom,
methodically reciting the French
alphabet.

‘Aah, bay say...”

Typical scenes at a university?
Yes and no.

‘They are not typical at Washing-
ton and Lee University for several
reasons. First, the rock-hunters are
a mixed group of men and women.
Two are Catholic nuns.

The youngsters studying French
are not college students but grade
schoolers. And seated behind them
in the classroom, observing their
every lip movement and sound, is
another mixed group of adults.

But the two scenes were typical

High School Teachers of French
And Geology Increase Knowledge
And Teaching Skills Under New

Summer Programs at the University

Directed by Dr. Drake © Dr. McGuire

this summer on the Washington
and Lee campus and in the sur-
rounding mountains. ‘The Univer-
sity was host to two federally-spon-
sored summer institutes, one in
French and the other in geology.

Both groups, made up of secon-
dary school teachers from many
states, lived in university dormi-
tories, ate in the school’s dining
hall, and attended classes and lab-
oratory sessions in Washington and
Lee facilities which are usually va-
cant during the summer.

In the French institute, the par-
ticipants not only became more
proficient in the language, but
learned something of the French
people, their country, and their
culture through lectures, slides, and
reading.

‘The

were observers while others learned.

French participants also
Each week day a group of approx-
imately 25 Lexington school chil-
dren in grades 7-12 who had never
had any previous French instruc-
tion attended a “demonstration
class.”

During the hour-long session, the
students were taught by James P.
Ward, a Falls Church, Va., teacher
and a member of the institute staff.
He employed the latest teaching
methods and techniques.

After the grade schoolers ended
their session with Ward, it was the
institute participants’ turn. Con-
sulting notes they had taken dur-

ing the demonstration class, they
discussed with Ward the methods
he used. He explained why he used
them and the participants “‘criti-
qued” them.

Participants in such institutes are
with French.
“They listen to French spoken in

almost bombarded
person and on records, they speak
French (dinner conversation in the
language is required at mealtime),
they read French and they write
French,” noted Dr. G._ Francis
Drake, the Washington and Lee
professor who was institute direc-
tor.

While the emphasis in the French
institute was on teaching the teach-
ers the latest in techniques and
methods, the objective in the geol-
ogy institute was to increase the
participants’ knowledge of geology.

As one participant described it,
“It's like taking a complete intro-
ductory geology course in six
weeks.”

Besides classroom instruction and
lab work with Dr. Odell C. Me-
Guire, institute director, and _ his
staff, the geology participants took
several field trips to study geologi-
cal formations in the Virginia coun-
tryside.

Not only did they chip at road-
side rocks, but they were able to
combine field trips with visits to
tourist attractions such as Natural
Bridge, Luray Caverns and Appo-
mattox.

 

hn

Washington and Lee’s summer institutes in French and Geology were designed to fulfill different purposes. The French institute’s

goal was to instruct high school teachers in the latest, most effecitve teaching techniques, as well as to increase their competency in

the language. The demonstration class, shown in session above, permitted teachers to observe an expert instructor in action with a

group of youngsters confronting French for the first time. The geology institute was primarily concerned with instructing high school

“These phenomena are of in-
terest geologically as well as being
wonders of nature,” Dr. McGuire
noted.

Both institutes proved highly suc-
cesful in achieving their goals, ac-
cording to the men who direct
them.

Dr. McGuire, assistant professor
of geology at Washington and Lee,
cites two “main reasons” for the
SUCCESS:

“First, we had a good group,
thirty-one persons. We had enough
applications so that we could be
more selective and get the type per-
son who really wanted to get some-
thing out of the institute.

“Secondly, this area of Virginia
is ideal for the type of geological

instruction we wanted to

give.
here is such a variety of geological
formations in the Blue Ridge, the
other surrounding mountains and
in the valleys.”

Dr. Drake's staff included mem-
bers of the Washington and Lee
Department of French, a number of
Visiting instructors and five French
natives who conducted conversation
COUTSCS.

“The outstanding feature of this
Institute,” says Dr. Drake, ‘was the
excellent group of participants and
the excellent staff which cooperated

 

so well with each other.

The forty-nine French teachers
who were students this summer be-
lieve the institute, and especially
the demonstration classes, was most
beneficial. Said one:

“Most of us teach a beginner's
class such as this demonstration
class, and here we can see how
the youngsters react to different
techniques, and thus we can_pos-
sibly avoid pitfalls when we are
teaching.”

Dr. Drake feels the class benefited
the grade schoolers as well, even
though they received no formal
credit.

“The kids get a big kick out ol
the class,” he said. “They must be-
cause we had very few dropouts,
and attendance is entirely volun-
tary. Though they get no credit,
this instruction will stand them in
good stead when they take regular
French courses in school.”

Federal grants under the Na-
tional Defense Education Act and
National Science Foundation  pro-
grams financed all expenses of the
institutes, including staff salaries
and a stipend of $75 a week for
the participants.

mond was formed more than

three decades ago “to promote...
education in the realm of art.”
Washington and Lee University
undertook to do the same when it
established its Fine Arts Depart-
ment in 1949. This fall, the two
institutions will join forces to pro-
vide a new and dynamic way to
realize their goal.

Artmobile IV, the “Collegiate
Artmobile,” will visit Lexington
November 5 for exclusive showings
on the Washington and Lee and
VMI campuses. The traveling art
gallery will be in the midst of its
inaugural tour, and securely dis-

the Ancient World,” a comprehen-
sive exhibition prepared by the
Museum staff exclusively for sixteen
Virginia colleges and universities.

The story of the Collegiate Art-
mobile began in 1953, the year the
Museum commissioned its first mo-
bile museum. Financed solely by
private funds, the world’s first Art-
mobile took to the road and began
a tour of Virginia that has not yet
slowed down.

Since then, mobile art ventures
have been established in a_ few
other states, but the Virginia Mu-
seum still is regarded as the pio-
neer in this field. Inquiries about
design, construction, and operation
have come from overseas and from
nearly every state in the nation.
In the past few months, largely be-
cause of increases in federal monies
made available to art-conscious
governments and institutions, the
influx of visitors to the Museum has
accelerated to a sometimes dizzying
pace,

‘The Museum’s Artmobile II was
donated in 1962 and by last year
private donors had given some
$160,000 for two more vehicles, one
of them the Lexington-bound Art-
mobile IV. The Carnegie Corpor-
ation of New York and E.  Clai-
borne Robins of Richmond of the
pharmaceutical firm of A. H. Rob-
ins Company, Inc., each donated
half of the $65,000 cost of the Col-
legiate Artmobile trailer. An anon-
ymous Museum friend gave $15,000

for both new tractors.
‘The arises:
Why attach a “for college only”

natural question
label to this new Museum acquisi-
tion?

Museum staff members, in_ par-
ticular the Director, Leslie Cheek,
Jr., had convincing reasons. Since
World War II,
Virginia had added full-fledged art

departments to

sixteen colleges in

their curricula.
These departments had advanced
in most areas, but they all shared
a common problem: the absence of
original art objects for the benefit

An investigation revealed that

and goth centuries.

“None of the institutions pro-
vided original objects to illustrate
the world-wide field of man’s artis-
tic creativeness from primitive to
the present,’”’ Mr. Cheek noted in a
report to college presidents in No-

one was limited to

vember, 1964. “And the chance that
these colleges would ever acquire
such collections seemed to grow
dimmer in proportion to the ever
more costly art market.”

Mr. Cheek reasoned that the Vir-
ginia Museum, supported by the
state, recipient of regular income
from private endowments, and _par-
ticipant in loan agreements with
many of America’s older and larg-
er museums, indeed is in a_posi-
tion to make works of art available.

Naturally, the Museum’s exist-
ing Artmobile system provided the

 

periect

means for accomplishing

the task. Not only was the entire
system already solidly established,
but it also had gained a reputation
throughout art-lending circles for
unparalled safety of art objects.
Specifically, the Artmobiles_ in-
clude a sophisticated theft preven-
tion system; anti-fire measures; and
even air conditioning and humidity
control, designed as much for the
safety of the delicate pieces on dis-
play as for the comfort of visitors.
No small part of this reputation is
due to the extreme care the staf
takes in securing the works for their
cross-country Virginia jaunts.

At that meeting, Andrew Ritchie,

things, the Artmobile’s circuit was
mapped and subjects for the first
two exhibitions were chosen.

How will the program be imple-
mented on the sixteen Virginia
campuses?

Financially, a $31,500 grant from
the Carnegie Corporation will be
used to establish an initial orien-
tation program in cooperation with
the University Center in Virginia,
Inc. Each semester the colleges will
receive a Artmobile
visit, always featuring a different
exhibition, to have been selected

week-long

the previous spring at a meeting of
art department chairmen and key
Museum staff members. In addi-
tion, two seminars will be held at
the Museum during the 1967-68
fall and spring semesters to famil-
iarize the college representatives
with the use of original art ob-
jects on campus. The seminars will
be led by leading art personalities.

An Artmobile advisor, Dr. Mary

 

 

     

F. Williams, chairman of the Ran-

dolph-Macon Woman's College art
department, will visit the campuses
in the fall of 1967 to confer with
the faculty and administration, on
the most effective use of the Artmo-
bile at each location. The Mu-
seum’s full-time Artmobile coordi-
nator, Charles L. Wyrick, will over-
see the day-to-day operation and
visit the colleges occasionally dur-
ing the year. Mr. Wyrick, a former
professor of English at Stephens
College in Missouri and a holder of
a Master of Fine Arts degree, will
adapt his special talents to both
the educational and exhibition
phases of the program.

When the Artmobile arrives on
campus, it will be under the sole
supervision and control of Dr. Jun-
kin and his committee.

Washington and Lee students of
the many subjects that relate di-
rectly or indirectly to art of the
world will then file through to

hopefully they will benefit from
their experience.

‘Len Months at Sea

For Lwo W&L Men

Warren Montgomery, ’67, Describes Life
Aboard an Oceanographic Research Ship
for Him and Another Student who In-
terrupted ‘Their Academic Careers To

Join an Important Scientific “Team

S THE sHIP rolled sickeningly to starboard and then
A lurched forward through heavy seas off the coast
of New Jersey, I thought, “What have I gotten into? I
should be back at W&L right now.” For the tenth time
that night I staggered out onto the deck and over to
the rail, to keep from being sick in the afterlab. “Iwo
months later, watching sunrise over the cloud-shrouded
peaks of Tahiti, I was again incredulous at being
aboard an oceanographic research ship rather that at
the usual academic labors of Washington and Lee’s
junior year.

The oceanographic adventure started in the late fall
of 1965, when I and other students taking courses in
geology at Washington and Lee heard visiting ocean-
ographer Richard Pratt speak on modern explora-
tion of the sea and the earth beneath it. The idea of
sea-going research was intriguing, and after one of his
lectures, I asked Dr. Pratt if students were ever taken
aboard research ships. He encouraged me to write to
several oceanographic research organizations. With
the attitude that there was nothing to lose in doing so,
I wrote three and then quickly forgot about the fanci-
ful notion of going to sea instead of going to college.

But when I arrived back in Lexington after Christ-
mas vacation, there was a letter from Lamont Geo-
logical Observatory of Columbia University informing
me that I had a very good chance of joining in the

Author WARREN MONTGOMERY proudly exhibits the
nepholometer, an underwater camera and_ light
unil, which he made himself in the Vema’s ma-
chine shop, after the ship's regular unit was lost
on the ocean bottom. MONTGOMERY is currently a

senior majoring in geology, with plans for graduate
study in his field. His home is in Memphis, Tenn.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

The author took this photo-
graph of the Vema from a small
boat during an anchorage in the
South Pacific. The Vema was
built in the 1920’s and was once
used by heiress Barbara Hutton
as a pleasure schooner. During
World War Il and immediately
aflerward, it was employed by
the Navy as a cargo vessel, The
Lamont Observatory purchased
the ship and completely remod-
eled it to conform to its special
research requirements.

forthcoming cruise of the research vessel Vema into the
Pacific ocean. It turned out that Lamont would take
two students, and after interviews in New York, my
fellow geology major Chip Roadman and I were signed
up as scientific personnel of the Vema’s crew. Washing-
ton and Lee obliged us with leaves-ol-absence for one
vear,

So, on February 11, 1965, Chip and I were aboard
the 200-loot long, ex-schooner Vema as she put out of
New York and into the Atlantic, en route to the Pana-
ma Canal and the Pacific. The cruise was to last just
ten months and cover over 46,000 nautical miles be-
lore the ship returned to New York the following De-
cember.

After a lew days of sea sickness, we settled down
to the routine of research. The ship’s complement con-
sisted of a Nova Scotian sailing crew of nineteen, in-
cluding captain and officers, and twelve scientists, most-
ly American but including German, Chinese, and Jap-
anese members. Each of us had a specific research job
to perform under the supervision of a chief scientist,
and we each had to stand eight hours of watch a day
as well. “Watch” entailed monitoring the complex
oceanographic electronic equipment and periodically
marking the time on data records.

The ship performed a number of research opera-
tions at once. While under way, customarily at around
10 knots under deisel power, instruments towed _ be-
hind the ship and mounted on the hull collected data,
which were electronically processed and printed as
graphs in the electronics lab, or afterlab. In this man-
ner, we made continuous measurements of the earth’s
magnetic and gravity fields, water temperature, depth

&

 

 

 

to the bottom, and the configuration of the layered

sediments beneath the bottom.

At least once a day the ship would heave-to to make
stationary measurements. At these daily stations, 20 to
bo-loot cores ot the bottom sediments would be
brought up, microscopic plant and animal life (plank-
ton) would be sampled with nets, photographs would
be made of the bottom, water samples would be taken,
and the bottom temperature would be measured for
evidence of heat flowing up from the earth’s interior.

Chip’s job was to analyze the bottom cores; my as-
signment was to operate the bottom cameras and de-
velop the films. Over most of the ocean, the water is
two to three miles deep, and all station instruments
were lowered trom the deck. No one ever went over
the side into the water to take measurements. (In fact,
the captain had an iron-clad rule against swimming in
the sea while on station—there was too much danger
from sharks.)

The Vema remained at sea up to a month between
ports, rarely sighting land or other shipping during
these times. For such long periods at sea, the Vema car-
ried great quantities of fuel and stores. Fresh water
was plentiful enough to shower and wash clothes,
thanks to condensers which converted salt sea water
to fresh. The research equipment was maintained by
large stores of electronic components and replacement
parts for other gear. A machine shop occupied almost
a fourth of the space below deck.

For the scientists, the day-to-day routine of re-
search was rigorous. For a man on the 8 to 12 watch,
a typical day might go as follows: Out of the bunk
at 0730 and on watch at o800. Monitor instruments

and mark data records from o800 to 1200. Dinner at
1200 followed by work on individual research project—
analyzing cores, developing film, maintaining elec-
tronics equipment, etc. Ship heaves-to for station at
1400 (2:00 p.m.); assist with station instruments—core,
cameras, nets, or water barrels. Ship under way again
at 1700 (5:00 p.m.); help put out towed gear and then
go to supper. Go on watch again at 2000 (8:00 p.m.)
untill oo00 (midnight), then turn in.

Such a schedule left little time for leisure, and when
intensive station work (two or three stops a day) occur-
red, we missed sleep as well. ‘The work week lasted all
seven days; we were much too busy ever to be bored.

No matter how exotic its itinerary, a research ves-
sel does not resemble a cruise ship, although the Vema
once was one. All available space is occupied by instru-
ments and equipment; and living quarters are small
and crowded. On the Vema, the scientists were bunked
in four two-man cabins and a four-man cabin, in the
aft part of the ship. The cabin that Chip and I shared
measured six feet by eight. ‘The cabins of the officers
and chief scientist were not much larger, and the crew
occupied bunks in the forecastle. Except for the cabins
and the small dining room, there was no place to relax,
the rest of the ship being working space.

But the discomforts of hard work, long hours, and
cramped quarters were more than offset for Chip and
me by the stimulating experience of participating in
important scientific research while working with some
of the world’s most outstanding oceanographic scien-
tists. Equally rewarding was the experience of calling at
ports that most Americans seldom see. ‘Though fast
being exposed to the so-called benefits of western civi-
lization by its French owners, Tahiti is still a tropical
paradise of grandiose scenery and friendly people.

This photograph of the author on watch suggests the climati

extremes encountered by the Vema and its crew during the

j6,000-mile voyage. This shot was made while near the Aleutian
Island of Adak.

Hawaii matches the volcano, reel, and beach vistas
of Polynesia with a vigorous, transplanted culture of
American, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and native pco-
ples.

Tokyo was perhaps the most interesting place we
visited. Here, western architecture, dress, and com-
merce blend and sometimes conflict with traditional
Japanese values and customs. While we were always
treated with the famous Japanese politeness and con-
sideration, we were also aware of the almost daily anti-
American demonstrations (one of which Chip and |
witnessed) against the war in Vietnam.

In Manila, we saw both the friendship which the
Filipinos still have for America and the poverty and
corruption which plague this archipelago republic.
Panama seemed an even worse case of an impoverished
economy and dissatisfied people. Here, Americans are
not so highly regarded, mutely underscored by the gut-
ted shell of the Pan-Am Building, burned in Panama
City during the anti-American riots over the Canal.

Our less interesting ports at least provided much-
needed rests from our research work. Okinawa was an
Oriental rurality, Bermuda was quaintly  British-
colonial, and Adak in the Aleutians was cold and
rainy—but restful.

When we finally steamed back through Verrazano
Narrows and into New York Harbor last December,
we were almost as excited to be home as we had been
at the prospect of sailing ten months before. However,
when Chip and I returned to Washington and Lee to
take up where we had left off, we realized that we had
had an experience in travel and training for our future
professions that is of inestimable value to us. We have
enjoyed a unique interlude to our studies at Washing-
ton and Lee.

year, although the number of contributors supporting
the 1965-1966 effort was 272 below that of the previous
campaign.

well as their gifts, to the fund drive.

ist Lt. Robert Wheelock, ’6

3, Visits Campus

ROTC Classes Learn Helicopter
Warlare from “‘Soc ‘Trang Tiger”’

IRST LT. ROBERT L. WHEELOCK, IL,
6s returned to the campus
from Vietnam early in October,
and found himself a guest lectur-
er belore students in the Univer-
sity’s ROTC classes.

One of the first of Washington
and Lee’s Vietnam veterans to
visit the University since the big
American build-up began over a
year ago, Wheelock described the
mission and tactics of helicopter use
in Southeast Asia.

Behind him were over 650 hours
as a combat helicopter pilot with
the famous 121st Assault Helicop-
ter Company, the “Soc Trang ‘Tig-
ers’ who are the second-oldest
helicopter unit fighting in Vietnam.

Wheelock, who prepared for his
Army commission while a Washing-
ton and Lee ROTC cadet, visited
friends at the University and con-
sulted with faculty members in the
School of Commerce and Adminis-
tration on his plans for graduate
school when he completes his active
duty commitment. Next duty. sta-
tion for Wheelock is Fort Wolters,
Texas, where he expects to be an
instructor at the Army’s primary
helicopter training center.

Solt-spoken and modest in re-
gard to his personal accomplish-
ments in military service, Wheelock
provided ROTC cadets with a val-
uable insight on the Vietnam war.
He surprised some when he describ-
ed the American mission in Viet-
nam as “not primarily to kill the
Viet Cong, but to rehabilitate them
as useful citizens of South Viet-
nam.”

Betore coming to Lexington,
Wheelock was interviewed by a
reporter for his hometown news-

paper, the Corsicana, Texas, Daily
Sun. Phe major portion of this in-
terview is reprinted below:

Just what does a helicopter pilot
do in war torn Vietnam?

“You call it,

lock replied with an ever widening

we haul it,” Whee-

erin as he relaxed from the ten-
sion built up from months of war
and the excitement of getting home
safe and sound to loved ones.

Lt. Wheelock landed in Vietnam
Sept. 15, 1965, and was stationed
at Soc Trang military base about

 

110 miles southwest of Saigon. His
outfit the 121st Assault Helicopter
Company was known as the “Soc
Trang Tigers” and it’s the second
oldest American chopper unit: in
Vietnam, going there in September,
1gbe.

His craft, the UH-1 (Huey)
made by Bell Helicopter at Hurst,
is the standard troop carrier type.
The Soc Trang Tigers fly in assault
troops, re-supply missions, and after
major battles go back to airlift the
dead, and perform rescue opera-

 

 

Lv. WHEELOCK uses a map of Southeast Asia to describe air assault

operations in which he participated as a helicopter pilot in South
Vietnam.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

tions whenever necessary and _ pos-
sible.

Wheelock was the intelligence
officer and assistant operations ol-
ficer for his company.

Out of modesty, he was reticent
about his personal war experiences
preferring to speak of his unit, and
their group activities and accom-
plishments and the honors accord-
ed the units.

Drawn out, he recounted one in-
cident in which his ship flew pro-
tective cover while another chopper
rescued two aviators from the Car-
rier Enterprise whose plane was
shot down in the Gulf of Siam,
and another time when he ran
across another Corsicana helicopter
pilot ist Lt. Budd Beasley stationed
at Bien Hoa, northeast of Saigon.
Beasley's unit is nicknamed the
“Cowboys.”

On this particular occasion
Wheelock’s company had run some
trawlers from North Vietnam

aground where they were bring-
ing in supplies to a hard core VC
(Viet Cong) area.

As he put it, “We ran into a little
trouble, we had all our aircraft en-
gaged and we were undermanned
for the size of the operation and
called on the Cowboys,” he related,
explaining that it was a normal
thing for one company to support
or go in and help out another unit
when the occasion required.

Wheelock’s unit was a member
of the initial helicopter assault in
the socalled “Iron Triangle’ last
year shortly before Christmas. The
Iron Triangle is an area, he ex-
plained, near Ben Cat which for
years had been a VC sanctuary.
Helicopters, including Wheelock’s,
carried in Australian and U.S. com-
bat troops “to clean it up and set
it up so the ist Infantry could come
in and set up operations, later sup-
ported by air strikes by B52 bom-
bers.” ‘This was a major engage-
ment and one that was publicized
in Life magazine, he recalled.

Wheelock received combat

SUMMER 1966

wounds, but it was from a ground
attack by the VC on his Soc Trang
base, and not while he was flying.
It was on June 22 when the VC
shelled the air field with 75 mm
recoilless rifles. He was hit by fly-
ing debris from the shelling.

“It was one of many attacks, but
I was only under about ten such
incidents,” he recalled. Lt. Whee-
lock said the U.S. military forces
usually knew when to expect such
attacks, but not always. Security
guards for their bases were sup-
plied by Vietnamese soldiers.

The area of Vietnam’ where
Wheelock saw most of his year’s
duty was in the Delta country, pri-
marily rice fields, in the open low
lands; the jungles being mostly to
the north. Because of this region,
his 13th Combat Aviation Battal-
ion, comprised of four companies,
was called the Delta Battalion.

“T got shot at plenty of times but
never hit (in the air),” he answered,
reaching to a table between his and
the reporter's chair to gently
“knock wood.”

Wheelock’s unit, which had a
combat strength of 25 choppers, lost
only two pilots.

“T had a guy shot down right in
front of me once. He had an out-
standing record. We had plenty of
pilots shot down but we went in
and rescued them,” he related. Of
the two who were killed, he ex-
plained they were hit by heavy anti-
aircraft fire and there was nothing

A STATEMENT

The following is a statement of owner-
ship, management, and circulation of THE
ALUMNI MAGAZINE of Washington and
Lee University as required by act of Con-
gress of August 24, 1912, as amended by
the Acts of March 3, 1933, July 2, 1946, and
June 11, 1960. THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE
is published quarterly and entered as sec-
and class matter at the post office at Lex-
ington, Virginia, September 15, 1924.

The printer is the Washington and Lee
Journalism Laboratory Press with C. Har-
old Lauck as superintendent. William C.
Washburn is the editor and business man-
ger. The address of the preceding is:
Washington and Lee Alumni, Incorporated,
Lexington, Virginia.

The owner is the Washington and Lee
University Alumni, Incorporated, Lexing-
ton, Virginia. There are no bondholders,
mortgage, or other security holders. The
average number of copies of each issue of
the publication during the twelve preced-
ing months was 11,000.

to be done for them when their
ships exploded.

The young pilot explained that
whatever type of helicopter air-
craft is needed for a particular mis-
sion is sent, but a medic helicopter
flies above as cover. Some craft such
as his are primarily for ferrying in
assault troops, they have armaments
lor protective purposes, but not as
much firepower as ships whose pur-
pose is to seek out and shoot at
the enemy. The medic choppers are
equipped with hoists for lifting
wounded from remote junglelike
areas where they can’t set down.

Wheelock’s aircraft would de-
scend to the ground, knowing usu-
ally that it was safe, the landing
area having already been secured.
Of course, there were times when
fellow pilots were downed and they
landed, or hovered to effect the res-
cue, and there was no such thing as
security.

The Corsicanan’s unit got the
Distinguished Unit Citation, which
is the highest unit award the nation
gives, and his company was the only
company size unit to receive the
Vietnamese Fourragere, decoration
to a unit of troops lor conspicuous
gallantry. Only three American
units ever received the Fourragere
in Vietnam and they were much
larger size units than his company.

His decorations, in addition to
these high honors, include the Air
Medal with 15 Oak Leaf clusters,
the Army Commendation Medal
for Valor, Purple Heart, National
Defense Service Medal of the Unit-
ed States, National Defense Service
Medal of Vietnam, the Vietnamese
Cross of Gallantry (division level),
and he was put in by superior of-
ficers as a candidate to receive the
Bronze Star for meritorious service.

Wheelock received his Army
commission upon graduation from
Washington and Lee in June, 1963,
and entered active duty in June,
1963. He received his helicopter
training at Fort Rucker, Ala., and
Fort Wolters.

OBERT MITCHELL WHITE, II, ‘38,
R will be elected the 50th presi-
dent of Sigma Delta Chi on No-
vember 11, almost thirty years to

the day after being initiated into
the national professional journal-
istic society during his under-
graduate years at Washington and
Lee University.

White, 51, noted editor and pub-
lisher of the Mexico (Mo.) Evening
Ledger whose distinguished back-
ground also includes the editorship
and presidency of the New York
Herald Tribune from August, 1959,
to March, 1961, was elected Sigma
Delta Chi’s vice president and pres-
ident-elect at the 56th annual con-

34

By MAurRIceE R. FLIEss, '66

The author was 1965-66 president of the
Washington and Lee University chapter
of Sigma Delta Chi and chapter delegate
to the Los Angeles convention of SDX.
He is currently graduate assistant in jour-
nalism at West Virginia University, whose
SDN chaptey is co-host at the 19066 con
vention in Pittsburgh.

vention in Los Angeles, Calif., in
November, 1965.

During the 57th convention at
Pittsburgh, Pa., this November,
White will assume the presidency
of the world’s largest society ol
professional journalists, climaxing
a step-by-step progression along the

trail of the organization's highest

offices. White was elected 1963-64
national treasurer three years ago,
followed by his election as national
secretary in 1964—in which capacity
he served the Los Angeles conven-
tion.

A tall, handsome man, White will
alumnus of

become the second

Washington and Lee  Universi-
ty to preside over a national pro-
fessional organization in_ three
years. Lewis F. Powell, Jr., ‘29, ol
Richmond, Va., was president ol
the American Bar Association in
1964.

Like CBS News correspondent
Roger Mudd, White achieved na-

tional prominence in journalism

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

after majoring in history at Wash-
ington and Lee. But the Mexico,
Mo., native did take numerous
courses in the department of jour-
nalism and wrote for the Ring-tum
Phi. For his achievements in jour-
nalism on campus he was initiated
into Sigma Delta Chi in 1936.

“The chapter sessions in those
days were mostly time well spent
sitting at the feet of one ‘Tom
Riegel (Professor O. W. Riegel,
veteran chairman of the depart-
ment of journalism and communi-
cations) and listening to shop talk,”
White says, adding, “And even to-
day, there is no one I would rather
swap stories with than Tom.”

In 1938, White graduated from
Washington and Lee, where he had
played varsity football and made
his mark in that sport, to comple-
ment his accomplishments in jour-
nalism and in history. He was also
a member of Beta Theta Pi, and
in 1961 the fraternity selected him
as “Beta of the Year.”

A former carrier boy for the
Mexico Ledger, White returned
after graduation to that evening
daily newspaper—a — publication
purchased and once published by
his grandfather and at that time
published by his father, L. Mitchell
White. In 1939, White joined the
Kansas City bureau of United
Press until called into service in
November, 1940, as a second lieu-
tenant in Battery B, 128th Field
Artillery.

After World War II, during
which White compiled an impres-
sive record (promotion to rank of
major, the Bronze Star for “meri-
torious service in the Southwest
Pacific area, 1942-1944," and a
Presidential Unit Citation), White
returned to Mexico, Mo., to be-
come co-editor and publisher of
the Mexico Ledger.

Sigma Delta Chi held its national
convention in Missouri, at St.
Louis, in 1953. “I was involved in
some minor capacity,” White re-
calls, “little knowing the conven-
tion was to be a turning point in

SUMMER 1966

my life.” ‘The turning point was
White’s meeting Bernard Kilgore,
president of The Wall Street Jour-
nal and a man White considers
“truly one of the publishing gen-
iuses of our age.”

“Meeting him was the beginning
of a long and treasured friendship,”
White recalls. Among other things
this friendship has led to continued
active interest in Sigma Delta Chi,
becoming president and editor of
the New York Herald Tribune, and
establishing that there is at least
one man on this earth I can regular-
ly beat in golf, although Mr. Kil-

gore might dispute this fact.”

At the San Diego convention
of Sigma Delta Chi in 1958, White
and Kilgore discussed what steps
could be taken to preserve the
Herald Tribune. In April, 1959,
while attending the American
Newspaper Publishers Association
meeting in New York, White re-
ceived an invitation — relayed by
Kilgore—from the Whitney family
“asking me to talk to them about
the Herald Tribune” they owned.

An agreement was reached;
White became the editor and pres-
ident that August, ushering in a
new and revitalized era for the
historic journal which traced _ its
roots to Horace Greeley. Under
White’s leadership, the Herald
Tribune won some of the most
coveted journalistic awards, includ-
ing one Pulitzer Prize. It jumped
from 1oth to sixth in the Bernay
survey of the nation’s Top ‘Ten
Newspapers—the largest gain in the
history of the survey.

On November 18, 1960, John
Hay Whitney, owner of the Herald
Tribune announced in’ London
where he was ambassador to the
Court of St. James’ that White had
resigned and his resignation had
been regretfully accepted. “In the
past year and a half,” Whitney said,
“Bob White has made an enormous
contribution to the paper. He has
successfully directed its rebuilding
during my absence and has laid the

groundwork for continued develop-
ment and growth.

When the New York Herald Tri-
bune tragically folded during the
newspaper strike of 1966, few were
sadder than Robert M. White, II.

Belore moving to the Herald
Tribune and while serving as
special consultant to the editor and
publisher of the Chicago Sun-
Times, White had been named a
member of the National Council of
Sigma Delta Chi. In 1958, he was
elected SDX’s national treasurer,
but the forthcoming stint in New
York delayed White’s ascension to
the top of the journalistic society.

Upon his return to Mexico, Mo.,
White says he “soon found myself
once again busy with SDX. And
this in turn led to the chairs
through which I am now going.”
He also resumed the winning of
many honored awards for the Mex-
ico Ledger, one of the nation’s
most-decorated newspapers. Among
its awards is the Sigma Delta Chi
National Distinguished Award for
editorials in 1952.

White will take office at a con-
vention that promises to be a tu-
multuous one, with an agenda that
includes a proposal to admit female
journalists into the organization,
and a proposal to consider chang-
ing the name of Sigma Delta Chi,
founded in 1909 and now contain-
ing about 170 campus and _ profes-
sional chapters.

He says he has firm goals for
Sigma Delta Chi which he will pre-
sent “at a later time and in the
context of a more fully rounded
program.” One of his goals, he ad-
mits, is to work in a visit to Wash-
ington and Lee during a busy pres-
idential year “and again sit at the
feet of Tom Riegel.”

White is married to the former
Barbara Spurgeon, of Muncie, Ind.,
and they have three daughters, Bar-
bara, 17, Jane, 16, and Laura, 11,
and one son, Robert M. White, ITI,
