Do You Remember ?

 

HE ABOVE PHOTOGRAPH is submitted by Joseph B.

Dabney who attended Washington and Lee in
1891-1893. He identifies the picture as that of the
Washington and Lee Glee Club in the year 1892-93
and recalls that “George Lenert, ’95 was the leader,
Thomas Emory Merril, ’95 played the violin, A. L.
Dabney, ’92 (a brother) played the flute and I (J. B.
Dabney wearing a derby) strummed one of the gui-
tars.” The other members of the Glee Club: in this
photograph have not been identified. It is apparent

that members of the Glee Club at the turn of the cen-
tury were men of many talents who not only sang but
provided their own music. ‘This practice was apparent-
ly standard procedure until about 1902 when there be-
gan both a Glee Club and a Mandolin Club.

Mr. Dabney who celebrated his 88th birthday in
December, 1960, resides in Vicksburg, Mississippi,
where he is a retired lawyer. He missed the General
Reunion of all classes in 1959 but says he hopes to be
on hand for the next one in 1964.

EE CHAPEL, symbol of Robert E.
L Lee’s continuing influence on.
Washington and Lee University
and a campus landmark remem-
bered and loved by all alumni, will
be restored and preserved through.
a gift of $370,000 to the Univer-
sity from the Ford Motor Com-
pany Fund of Dearborn, Mich.

Presentation of the first payment
of the gift was made at Commence-
ment when President Fred C. Cole,
in the president’s traditional re-
marks to graduates, urged a re-
emphasis of the ideals of honor,
integrity, and humility which
governed Lee’s life.

Allen W. Merrell, vice-president
of the Ford Motor Company Fund,
represented Henry Ford, II, in im-
pressive ceremonies on the Com-
mencement platform before 199
seniors and some 1,000 parents,
faculty, and others.

Mr. Merrell said the Fund’s.
trustees were impressed by the large
number of Americans, from all
over the nation, who visit Lee
Chapel annually, and he said they
were impressed by the fact that the
Chapel continues to be a “living”
shrine, an integral part of the life
of a university of “proud historic
and scholastic record.’ But he said
the most compelling reason to assist
in the Chapel’s restoration was
“the character of the man who
caused the Chapel to be erected.”

“General Robert E. Lee is loved
and respected by all Americans,”
Merrell declared. “His dedication
to the education of youth after he
had suffered the sorrow and agony
of military defeat catches up and
exemplifies the American ideal of
responsible citizenship.

“His courage, his integrity and
the lofty dignity of his character
that caused him to rise above bit-
terness inspire all of us. It is the
hope of the Ford Motor Company
Fund that, in helping in this way
to preserve his memory, we may
perhaps contribute a little also to
the preservation of the things for

For Lee Chapel Restoration

which he stood and which all of
us need particularly today.”

In accepting the first payment
of $25,000 from the Ford Fund,
President Cole asked Mr. Merrell
to assure the Fund’s trustees that
the gift will be applied “conscien-
tiously and prudently.”

“We shall proceed with our work
at the Chapel with a humble aware-
ness that all we do to restore and
preserve Lee Chapel not only hon-
ors a man whose life was noble and
generous, but honors as well those
principles of personal honor and
integrity that are the opportunity
of all men and which were pos-
sessed by Robert E. Lee in such
impressive abundance.”

The presentation and President
Cole’s subsequent graduation ad-
dress followed the conferring of
degrees and a valedictory address
by Brian H. Vitsky of Richmond.
Among the graduates were 23
Bachelors of Law, 25 Bachelors of
Science in Commerce, 22 Bachelors
of Science, three Bachelors of Sci-
ence in Chemistry, and 126 Bach-
elors of Arts.

Honorary degrees were confer-
red upon Stuart Thomas Saunders,
president of the Norfolk and West-
ern Railway Company, and, in ab-
sentia, David K. E. Bruce, Ameri-
can ambassador to England. Both
were made Doctors of Laws. (Ci-
tations on Page 6.)

SUMMER 1961

Ford Motor Company Fund’s Gift

Presented Betore Commencement Audience

Weather for the two-day program
of final exercises was ideal. Dr.
William F. Quillian, Jr., president
of Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege, delivered the Baccalaureate
sermon in Lee Chapel on Thurs-
day. Seniors and their parents were
guests of the Alumni Association
at luncheon that day, and in the
evening, President and Mrs. Cole
received parents and their sons at
their home.

On Friday, 38 seniors were com-
missioned Army second lieutenants

at g a.m. in Lee Chapel. Colonel
Ben L. Anderson, °38, was in
charge of the commissioning cere-
mony.

In his remarks to graduates, Pres-
ident Cole quoted often from Lee’s
correspondence with others and
from notes which the famed gen-
eral and educator jotted down as
guidance for himself.

President Cole cited the high
value which Lee attached to edu-
cation and he urged the 1961 sen-
iors to continue a “systematic pur-

suit of knowledge.’ He _ recalled
Lee’s integrity, and he warned his
audience that temptations to com-
promise integrity “will come soon
and often.”

“Under the circumstances of such
temptation,” President Cole assert-
ed, “I hope you will be able to re-
call that Robert E. Lee was a man
of uncompromising integrity and
that you, as alumni of Washington
and Lee, have a special obligation
to fulfill.”

Commenting on Lee’s humility,
the president said he hoped that
each graduate would take with him
a measure of Lee’s humble attitude.
“I want you to be proud of your
accomplishments as a graduate,”
President Cole said, “but I hope
you will have the humility to ac-
knowledge that the diplomas you
hold in your hands are possible
only because a great many other
persons also sacrificed and labored
in your behalf.”

The restoration of Lee Chapel is
expected to take from 18 months to
two years to complete. Architects
have begun detailed plans, and the
Boston firm of Perry, Shaw, Hep-
burn & Dean, which directed the
restoration of the 18th Century
City of Williamsburg, among other
historical projects, will act as con-
sultants to University architects.
Mr. William Perry, senior partner
of the firm, will conduct the ap-
propriate research for Lee Chapel.

President Cole has emphasized
that Lee Chapel’s appearance will

LEE’S WORDS

‘A True Glory,
A True Honor’

“There is a true glory and a true

honor: The glory of duty
done—the honor of integrity
of principle.”

*

“Private and public life are sub-

ject to the same rules; and
truth and manliness are two
qualities that will carry you
through this world much better
than policy or tact, or expedi-
ency, or any other word that
was ever devised to conceal or
mystify a deviation from a
straight line.”

*

“It is to men of high integrity
and commanding intellect that
the country must look to give
character to her councils.”

*

“So the work is done, I care not
by whom it ts done.”

 

 

not be changed. The building will
be restored as originally construct-
ed. The main masonry walls are
apparently structurally sound and
will continue to be used. Cer-
tain interior bearing walls will be
removed and rebulit or strength-
ened by adding steel columns and
beams within such walls. The ex-
isting interior columns will be re-
placed with new steel columns.
There will be new plaster ceilings
and walls throughout; also new
wood floors for the auditorium and
balcony, and benches and pews will
be refinished. All work will be
done with extreme care, and work-
manship and materials will be of
the highest quality, duplicating
where possible the materials used
originally.

The Chapel will be made fire-
resistant, and will include modern
heating, air-conditioning, and elec-
tric lighting that, of course, were
not in the original conception of
General Lee. Provision for dehumi-
dification of the interior will help
protect the priceless art collection
housed in the Chapel.

President Cole pointed out that
the University, whose first com-_
mitment, he emphasized, is to edu-
cation, has lacked for many years
the resources to take appropriate
steps for the Chapel’s restoration
and preservation. Among his prede-
cessors in office who agreed that
such steps were needed was George
Washington Custis Lee, who with
his father, helped plan the Chapel

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

and supervise its construction. In
1909, several years after he had
completed 30 years as president of
the University, he wrote to a friend
that rather than make some desired
changes in the Chapel, he’d rather
see a new one built, for he wrote,
“the present one is patched up
enough already.”

Lee Chapel was ordered built by
General Lee shortly after he as-
sumed the presidency of the Col-
lege in 1865.

One of the large architectural
drawings of interior specifications
remains in University hands today,
and on it are pen and ink nota-
tions, apparently in the handwrit-
ing of General Lee. He is reported
to have given the Chapel’s construc-
tion his close personal attention,
assisted by his son Custis, and one
of his son’s colleagues on the facul-
ty at neighboring VMI.

‘The red brick structure has been

described as a “‘style of architec-
ture plain indeed,” but is other-
wise identified as Victorian Gothic.
It was completed in 1868 in time
for graduation exercises, and sub-
sequent commencements were held
there until the Chapel’s small size
made it impractical for further
such use. It is still the scene of the
Baccalaureate sermon, although
parents and guests must sit on
folding chairs on the outside and
hear the speaker over a public ad-
dress system.

Following Lee’s death in 1870,
he was entombed near the center
of the Chapel’s lower level. A pho-
tograph of his funeral shows a
huge crowd of mourners gathered
about the Chapel, with the columns
of Washington College in the back-
ground draped with black crepe.

With the presentation of Ed-
ward Valentine’s famous ‘‘Recum-
bent Statue’ of Lee to the Uni-

versity in 1883, an extension was
built on the rear of the Chapel to
house the statue. The Lee family
crypt then was placed beneath the
statue chamber, Lee’s body was
moved the short distance to its
final resting place, and other mem-
bers of his family, including his
father, the famed “Light Horse
Harry” Lee of Revolutionary War
renown, were interred in the
mausoleum.

Since Lee’s death, many valuable
portraits have been hung in the
Chapel. The most noted is Charles
Willson Peale’s portrait of George
Washington, the first ever painted
of him, and executed in 1772 when
Washington was a “red coat’? in
Braddock’s army. Other interesting
and valuable paintings include a
Peale portrait of General Lafayette,
Pine’s famous painting of Lee in
Confederate uniform, a Harding
portrait of James Madison, a Hard-

ing of John Marshall, and a Gil-
bert Stuart of Washington.

In the Lee family collection in
the Chapel are two Van Dyck
paintings of members of the Cus-
tis family (Mrs. Lee), personal and
battlefield mementoes of General
Lee, and personal items once be-
longing to George Washington.
Lee’s office is preserved as it was
when he died.

Alumni remember with mixed
emotions the straight-backed, hard-
seat wooden pews of Lee Chapel,
made only slightly more comfort-
able today by the addition of a
foam rubber padding on the seat.

The Chapel continues to be used
for freshman orientation lectures,
various small university assemblies,
and other special occasions.

Many alumni will remember a
cartoon that once appeared in the
Southern Collegian, whose original
hangs on the wall of former Pres-
ident Francis P. Gaines. Dr. Gaines
is still sought after as a moving
public speaker, a gifted orator.
The cartoon depicts Dr. Gaines
addressing a Lee Chapel audience,
and the caption says, “Once when
Dr. Gaines spoke...” The draw-
ing shows George Washington in
the Peale portrait attending Dr.
Gaines closely, with a tear on his
cheek, and in the statue chamber,
General Lee has raised himself on
one elbow and he, too, is listening
with tears in his eyes.

mw The prospective restoration of
Lee Chapel and the general inter-
est in the Civil War Centennial is
bringing Washington and _ Lee
much nationwide publicity. A pho-
tographer for the National Geo-
graphic Society was on campus dur-
ing finals and a forthcoming issue
should contain several campus
views; the Ford Times is planning
a Chapel article; and nearly 300
newspapers carried pictures of the
Chapel when the Ford gift was
announced.

STUART ‘T. SAUNDERS, left, with Dr. JAMES H. STARLING, University Marshal

Citations of Honor

“STUART THOMAS SAUNDERS, President of the Norfolk and Western
Railway Company.

A native of West Virginia, a graduate of Roanoke College with his law
degree from Harvard, Mr. Saunders began his notable career as a lawyer in the
nation’s capital. Joining the legal staff of one of America’s great railways in
1939, his remarkable talents led to his appointment as its president in 1958.
Thereby Virginia retained a distinguished citizen and this University a faith-
ful friend.

Markedly successful in planning and executing the merger of railroads, Mr.
Saunders has proved himself as master of the connective word, “AND,” with all
its implications. His railroad, the Norfolk and Western, connects the Atlantic
Ocean with the Mid-West; his academic career embraced institutions in Virginia
and Massachusetts; his home has been in Virginia and its sister state to the west;
he is a trustee of both his alma mater and Hollins College; in his estimable work
with the Virginia Foundation of Independent Colleges he is indefatigable in
his efforts to open the doors (and even the treasuries) of business corporations
to the educational institutions of the Commonwealth.

‘This University, itself an example of the connective, since it links Washing-
ton and Lee, bestows upon an apt pupil, in admiration of his achievements, the
degree of Doctor of Laws.”

“DAVID K. E. BRUCE, farmer, author, legislator, lawyer, public servant,
diplomatist.

A native of Baltimore who received his education at Princeton, Virginia,
and Maryland, he practiced law in Baltimore, was a representative in the House
of Delegates in both Maryland and Virginia, served in the United States Army
in both World Wars, directed the Office of Strategic Services in the European
Theatre of Operations, was Assistant Secretary of Commerce and then Under-.
secretary of State. After having represented his country as Ambassador to
France and to the Federal Republic of Germany, he is now the American Am-
bassador to the Court of St. James’s.

The turning point in Mr. Bruce’s career came with his sagacious removal
from Maryland to Virginia, for since that time he has steadily enlarged his
range of usefulness—from the private practice of law and business to an ever-
widening arc of service to his country, from the halls of two state legislatures
to the highest councils of the Federal government, from the Free State of Mary-
land to the chancelleries of Paris, Bonn, and London, from a handsome farm
in Virginia’s Campbell County to the Court graced by such distinguished ambas-
sadorial predecessors as Pinckney, John Jay, John Quincy Adams, and John
W. Davis.

His grace of manner, his wise counsel, his diplomatic skill, his shrewd per-
ceptions of men and affairs, his expert knowledge, and his versatility of mind
merit for him the degree of Doctor of Laws.”

News of the University

Construction and Progress, But Some

Inconvenience; Surprise in Campus Politics

 

“Superintendent” DickEy views new science building works

UMMER VISITORS to the normally
S tranquil Washington and Lee
campus found a_ growing and
changing University, its air filled
with the growl of bulldozers, the
blast of jackhammers and dyna-
mite charges, and the ring of power
saws. Contractors were busy on
three fronts, providing buildings
and athletic fields. Even in quiet
Lee Chapel there was more activity
than usual as architects made pre-
liminary sketches and drawings,
and special inventory clerks count-
ed the Chapel’s contents in prepa-
ration for its major rennovation
and restoration.

Behind ‘Tucker Hall, the new
science building—future home of
the Department of Physics, Pre-
Engineering, and Biology—was a
gaping hole gouged in the _ hill-
side where the Howe Hall park-
ing lot once was. An elevator pit
and places for reinforced concrete
footings had been blasted in
the solid limestone, and concrete
walls and pillars were taking shape.
In Howe Hall, jackhammers had
chiseled out another elevator shaft
through solid concrete floors, and
more explosives were used to exca-
vate a pit on the lowest level. Be-
hind Howe Hall, more footings
and concrete forms were in place
for the new wing which will pro-
vide additional laboratory, class-
room, and office space for the De-
partments of Chemistry and Geol-

Ogy.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

Work on the new science facili-
ties brought some inconvenience.
Students taking final exams in the
north end of campus found the
noise of construction distracting.
Dean Charles P. Light, Jr., of the
School of Law displayed a large
fragment of stone that had been
lobbed into the student lounge
window in the basement of Tucker
Hall, causing a momentary delay
in the progress of a “Hearts” game
there. Through traffic via the back
campus drive from Washington
street to Letcher avenue became a
thing of the past. Signs warned
motorists at McCormick Library
that all roads lead to a dead end.
An already acute parking problem
was further complicated by the
elimination of many spaces by new
construction and its effects. A
large expanse of asphalt was laid
behind Doremus Gymnasium to
help ease parking pressures, but
students motoring in from the Sig-
ma Chi and Red Square houses
complained they were ending up
farther away from school than
when they started.

Over on Washington street, op-
posite the Freshman Dorm and
adjacent to the new Baker and
Davis upperclass and law dorms, a
third dormitory for this unit was
going up amid noise and dust. It
will help alleviate crowding in the
Freshman Dorm and will enable
the University to eliminate use of
auxiliary dormitories for  fresh-
men in university-owned dwellings.
Progress on this four-story building
has been markedly swift, according
to Dr. Robert W. Dickey, the hon-
orary sidewalk superintendent for
all new campus construction.

(Dr. Dickey was accorded this
important title at a reception in
honor of his June retirement as
head of the Department of Physics.
His certificate assures him all
“rights and privileges” of his new

premises and the opportunity to
advise the project foremen. But,

SUMMER 1961

Dr. Dickey complains, this certifi-
cate doesn’t guarantee they'll heed
his advice.)

Across the footbridge and_ be-
yond the stadium, more bulldozers
and giant earthmovers chewed
away at the hill which separated
the Alumni intramural field from
the baseball and soccer field named
in honor of Cap’n Dick Smith.
When the digging and filling was
done, the Athletic Department had
the equivalent of nearly two and
a half additional practice fields for
use by varsity and freshmen soccer,
football, lacrosse, and baseball
squads. Superintendent of Build-
ings and Grounds D. E. ‘Pat’
Brady, Jr., had an anxious time
when a severe summer storm struck
shortly after the new area was har-
rowed and seeded. But, luckily, the
washing was negligible.

Only one serious mishap has oc-
curred in connection with the var-
lous projects. An operator of a
front-end loader was injured when
his big machine overturned while
he was filling in a water main ditch
at the intersection of the campus
drive with Letcher avenue. His
injuries were painful but not crip-

pling.

& CAMPUS POLITICS this spring were
marked by some of the shrewdest
maneuvering since 1950 when wily
Bill Cogar delayed the election of
student body president Sam Hollis
until the following September.

Things started out normally
enough. The University Party, the
old “big clique,” presented a strong
slate of candidates, including a
young man considered unbeatable
in the battle for the top student
body office. The Independents,
or “little clique’ organization,
thought tall Rosie Page of Beaver-
dam, Va., was unbeatable, too. So
they decided not to challenge him,
but reasoned that their best boys
might have a good shot at the vice-
presidency and secretariat.

No one, at first, gave much
thought to the prostestations of

 

ANDREW “UNcAS” MCTHENIA, ’58

Grayfred Gray, a bearded senior
and a philosophy honor student.
For some time, Gray had been dis-
tributing a mimeographed news-
letter entitled ‘Protest,’ and sud-
denly Gray was protesting the ex-
isting political situation to the
four winds. He wanted to bring
about some changes in the student
body constitution, but most of all,
he wanted to see no one win the
student body presidency by de-
fault and without a platform.
With adroit persuasiveness and
considerable backing by the In-
dependent hierarchy, he ___pre-
vailed upon law student Andrew
“Uncas” McThenia to run on the
Independent ticket. No one had
even thought about Uncas before.
In fact, few knew he was even back
in school. He’d graduated, Phi
Beta Kappa and with honors, sev-
eral years previously and now he
had a master’s degree and was
going for his LL.B. as a mid-term
freshman. Suddenly, he was every-
body’s favorite, or so it seemed. At
least, he breathed new life into the
election campaign, setting forth a
broad platform and challenging»
Page to match it with one of his
own. A special voluntary assembly
was called for Doremus Gym
where all candidates would ex-

9

 

press their views on current topics
of interest. The faculty, somewhat
overwhelmed by this swift revita-
lization of campus politics, be-
grudgingly granted short classes so
everyone could attend, and most
did.

In the final testing, the moun-
tain twang of Alderson, W. Va.’s
Uncas was more persuasive than
the Tidewater drawl of Beaver-
dam’s Rosie. After one of the great-
est ‘“‘get-out-the-vote” efforts ever
seen at Washington and Lee, Mc-
Thenia was elected president, fel-
low law student Ray Robrecht, a
talented amateur boxer, was elect-
ed vice-president; and the quiet
Texas quarterback, Steve Suttle,
was in as secretary, making an
Independent clean sweep of the top
three positions.

Almost unbelievably, there was
a 100 per cent turnout from the
Law School, and political second-
guessers are convinced this did the
trick for McThenia. As law student
Charlie Broll put it:

“The way I see it, it’s a matter
of education. I think the president
of the student body should be an
educated man. McThenia’s got a
B.A. and an M.A. and he’s work-
ing on his LL.B. All this other
fellow’s got is a high school diplo-
ma.”

At any rate, campus politics this
year came out refreshingly differ-
ent. And everybody agrees that
the likeable young man with the
improbable name of Uncas will
make a good president.

m DR. EARL M. CRUM, 70, professor
of ancient languages, died on
July 28 in the University of Vir-
ginia hospital following a_ brief
illness. He had joined the Wash-
ington and Lee faculty on a part-
time basis in 1957, and in 1959,
upon the death of Dr. Henry V.
Shelley, he assumed full-time
duties.

Dr. Crum lived in Greenville,
Va., where he had retired in 1956
after 28 years as head of the De-
partment of Classical languages at
Lehigh University.

As an Army officer in World War
II, he was directly responsible for
the reopening of the University of
Heidelberg in Germany following
the cessation of hostilities. For his
service to the famed German uni-
versity, he was honored by its facul-
ty with an honorary degree in
1949. Recently upon his birthday,
he received letters of warm best
wishes from his friends there.

m™ DR. ROBERT D. WHITAKER, ’55, as-
sociate professor of chemistry, has
been named to a newly created post
of assistant director of admissions
by President Cole.

Dr. Whitaker, 28, will assist

Dean Frank J. Gilliam in office
interviews, school visitations, and
in selecting the entering classes for
the University. He will continue
to devote approximately halftime
to teaching.

“I think it will be extremely
helpful to have a person of Dr.
Whitaker’s scientific background
working with us in admissions,”
President Cole said. “With his
help we hope to interest more and
better students with special talents
in science in coming to Washing-
ton and Lee.”

Dr. Whitaker, a native of Tam-
pa, was a Phi Beta Kappa student
at Washington and Lee and re-
ceived his Ph.D. degree at the Uni-
versity of Florida in 1959. He
joined the University’s faculty the
same year.

= BY ACTION ON JUNE 1, 1961, the
Alumni Board of Trustees ap-
proved the transfer from the
Wedgwood plate account the sum
of $1,000.00 to the scholarship
funds of the University for the
purpose of establishing an alumni
scholarship.

The sale of the Washington and
Lee commemorative plates, through
the central office of the Alumni
Association, began some 20 years
ago and the profits therefrom have

 

HERBERT MICHAEL WALKER

ll

 

been used on various projects to
the benefit of the University.
The principal of the new gift
will be used for the immediate
needs of deserving young students
as opposed to the endowment type
scholarship. In taking this action
the board understood fully that the
available funds might be complete-
ly consumed in one or two years.
The recipient of the Alumni
scholarship for the 1961-62 session
is a rising junior, Herbert Michael
Walker, of Norfolk, Virginia. A
Dean’s List student in _pre-engi-
neering, Walker is also a varsity
football and track letterman and
was awarded the physical educa-
tion scholarship in June, 1961.

m= A LETTER WRITTEN by Dr. Henry
Ruffmer, president of Washington
College from 1836 to 1848, has
been found among a collection of
old letters purchased by a Wash-
ington and Lee University law stu-
dent.

Lewis Leigh, Jr., a freshman
lawyer, will give the letter to the
University. Written shortly after
Dr. Ruffner became president of
the college, it is addressed to a
Colonel Aspinwall, American con-
sul in London. It thanks Aspin-
wall for his help in obtaining a
valuable book on astronomy from
a London source for the College’s
library.

Librarian Henry Coleman be-
lieves that Vince’s Astronomy, pub-
lished in 1814, is the book referred
to in the letter. Iwo of the three
volumes are on the McCormick
shelves.

w DAVID W. HASLETT, of Hickory,
N. C., and Roy Carpenter, of
Bryan, Texas, will do graduate
study next year in Germany. Has-
lett became the third Washington
and Lee senior to receive a Ful-
bright award for 1961-1962, while
Carpenter received a German Gov-
ernment travel grant for study in
that country. Haslett also will study
in Germany.

Fifty Years a Teacher,
Dr. Robert Dickey Retires

Dr. Edward F. Turner, His
Former Pupil, Succeeds Him

COLLEGE TEACHING CAREER that

has spanned a half century

ended in June when Dr. Robert W.

Dickey retired as head of Wash-

ington and Lee University’s De-
partment of Physics.

Dr. Dickey, who first faced a
class of undergraduates as an as-
sistant in physics at Washington
and Lee in 1910, is succeeded as de-
partment head by Dr. Edward F.
Turner, Jr., 41, a former honor
student of Dr. Dickey’s and a 1950
graduate of the university.

Still vigorous at 70, Dr. Dickey
says he is looking forward to a re-
tirement of “scientific loafing.” By

 

Dr. EDWARD F. ‘TURNER, JR., ‘50

that, he says he means pursuing
scientific interests at a leisurely
pace.

“Primarily, I want to observe
construction work,” Dr. Dickey
says. “I like to watch buildings go
up. When I go to New York, I
don’t go to the art galleries or
places like that. I head for the
nearest skyscraper under construc-
tion.”

Dr. Dickey’s first degree at Wash-
ington and Lee in 1910 was a B.S.
in civil engineering, and although
he went on to master’s and doctor’s
degrees in physics at Johns Hop-
kins, he admits that he has re-
mained an engineer at heart.

 

Dr. RoBertT W. DICKEY, 711

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

Dr. Dickey is finding ample op-
portunity to witness much _ con-
struction on the Washington and
Lee campus, including one build-
ing that he has helped plan. Among
several construction projects un-
derway is a new science building
for physics and biology. For the re-
tiring professor, the new building
is at once a source of great pride
and mild regret. “I am delighted
that the building and its modern
facilities will be available soon, but
I would lke to have ended my
career in it,” he says. “I often have
said that I came here ten years too
soon.”

Both Dr. Dickey and Dr. ‘Turner
agree that the new facilities will
prove a tremendous boost to stu-
dent interest in physics at Wash-
ington and Lee.

“Our enrollment in physics has
already doubled in the past four
or five years and now undoubtedly
will grow more,” Dr. Dickey says.

Dr. ‘Turner is especially enthus-
lastic about accommodations plan-
ned for student research projects
under Washington and Lee’s new
Robert E. Lee Research Program.
“The research opportunities will
make a great difference in the way
in which the department will be
operated in the future,” Dr. ‘Turn-
er predicts.

In many ways, Dr. Dickey and
Dr. ‘Turner reflect the advance
and expansion of physics as a
science and academic discipline
over the past 50 years. Both men
have solid foundations in general
physics, but Dr. Dickey admits
that over the years his concern has
been primarily in teaching “‘classi-
cal” physics.

Dr. ‘Turner, who came to Wash-
ington and Lee originally to study
journalism, is a product of the
post World War II nuclear age,
with’ graduate work in nuclear
physics and an ambition to intro-
duce more of this area of study at
Washington and Lee University.
The new building has provisions

Dr. Dickey, a self-styled “classical” physicist, examines a planetarium purchased during
Lee’s administration to study the classical movements of earth, moon, and sun.

for a nuclear physics laboratory.

Dr. Dickey’s affiliation with
Washington and Lee began in 1906
when he enrolled as a freshman. A
charter member of the institution’s
Phi Beta Kappa chapter, he served
as a student instructor while earn-
ing B.S., B.A., and M.A. degrees,
and upon completion of graduate
school in 1916, he joined the facul-
ty as an associate professor.

He helped organize the depart-

ment of electrical engineering, and -

served as a professor of physics and
electrical engineering between 1928
and 1934. When Washington and
Lee abandoned its engineering cur-
riculum, Dr. Dickey became Cyrus
McCormick Professor of Physics,
and in 1947 he became a professor
on the ‘Thomas Ball Foundation.

Looking back, he singles out two
aspects of life at Washington and
Lee that have meant most to him.
“I think I appreciate the student
Honor System more than anything
about Washington and Lee,’ he
says. “And the intellectual freedom
that has existed here is another
striking point for which I am
grateful.”

He and Mrs. Dickey have retired
from their campus home to a story

and a haif Cape Cod-style home.
Dr. Dickey’s successor is an ener-
getic Purple Heart veteran of
World War II who doubted his
ability to handle a tough academic
load when he enrolled in 1946 at
age 26. Dr. ‘Turner went on to
earn both B.S. degree in physics
and B.A. degree in math and mem-
bership in Phi Beta Kappa.

_ Dr. ‘Turner received his M.S. in
nuclear physics at Massachusetts
Institute of ‘Technology in 1952
and his Ph.D. in solid state phy-
sics at the University of Virginia
in 1954. For three years he was an
assistant professor at George Wash-
ington University before joining
the Washington and Lee faculty as
an-associate professor in 197. Since
1959 he has held the rank of pro-
fessor. In the summers of 1955 and
Naval Research Laboratory in
Washington, and in 1957-58: he
held summer positions as a con-
sulting physicist for the Diamond
Ordnance Fuse Laboratory there.

Dr. Dickey will still keep his
finger in the teaching pie. He has
been asked to assist in the physics
department as a “distinguished
lecturer.”

Washington and Lee Will Seek
To Set Up Occupational File

FE’... Washington and Lee

alumnus, whether he be an at-
torney, a broker, an editor, an ac-
count executive, or a peanut farm-
er, knows the importance of com-
plete, accurate records and refer-
ence files in his particular work.
The more pertinent facts and fig-
ures a person has at his fingertips,
the better job he can do when the
job calls for such precise informa-
tion.

In the daily operation of a uni-
versity, there are almost countless
demands upon the records kept on
students, professors, classes, grades,
and alumni. Washington and Lee’s
recent addition of electronic data
processing equipment has increased
the availability of normal statis-
tical information, and it has also
opened up new opportunities for
expanded statistical recording in
other important areas.

One of these important areas in-
volves the records kept on alumni.

Because students and professors
are on campus most of the year, it
is a relatively easy task to keep their
records in first class order. Not so,
however, with the University’s
11,000 alumni who are spread all
over the nation and some foreign
countries. It has been some 14 years

SUMMER 10961

Important Questionnaire

‘To Go To All Former Students

since former students were asked to
fill in and return questionnaires on
their whereabouts and _ activities.
The opportunity to commit such
information to the speedy data pro-
cessing system has prompted the
University to plan circulation of a
new questionnaire for up-to-date
data on all of its former students.

‘The emphasis of the new ques-
tionnaire will be on the occupa-
tions of alumni. Much other val-
uable information will be obtained,
but the University is primarily in-
terested in finding out what each
alumnus is doing for a living. Such
knowledge is vital to Washington
and Lee in seeking the support of
the many foundations, corpora-
tions, and individuals interested in
assisting higher education. A foun-
dation whose primary interest is
the support of pre-medical pro-
grams may want to know how many
doctors there are among Washing-
ton and Lee’s alumni. An individ-
ual interested in helping develop
courses in creative writing might
be encouraged to help the Univer-
sity if it can tell him how many of
its former students are engaged in

literary activities. A prospective

corporate donor might wish to
know how many Washington and
Lee men hold top management

and executive positions. Thus, the
maintenance of an accurate occu-
pational file on alumni is one of
the greatest necessities of the mo-
ment.

Soon each alumnus will re-
ceive his copy of the questionnaire,
including instructions for its com-
pletion. He will be asked to answer
all questions and to submit as com-
plete a description of his occupa-
tion as possible. On the reverse side
of the questionnaire will be a tabu-
lated list of many occupational
categories. Each alumnus will be
asked to mark the category most
descriptive of his work. As the
questionnaires are returned, they
will be correlated in the Alumni
Office and appropriate information
will be transferred to the data pro-
cessing system. Subsequent period-
ic checks are planned to keep the
records accurate, and alumni will
be reminded to keep the Alumni
Office informed of changes in their
occupational status.

When your questionnaire ar-
rives, please do your University
the great service of completing it
promptly and returning it to Lex-
ington. Your cooperation will be
of utmost value to Washington and
Lee in a project of urgent import-
ance.

Coaches Have Problems
But They’re Different Now

Like What To Do With 28 Lettermen
And 20 Promising Sophomore Gridders

OYD WILLIAMS, the big former
B professional football player who
takes time out from his busy in-
surance business every fall to as-
sist in coaching the Generals, has
been associated with Washington
and Lee football since the fall of
1954, the year the university gave
up the so-called “big time.” Wil-
liams coached a “‘jayvee’ eleven
through a four-game schedule that
year, and then stayed on to assist
first Bill Chipley for two varsity sea-
sons and then Lee McLaughlin. He
has had more direct association
with the Generals’ program since
1954 than anyone else.

Thus, it’s always interesting to
hear how Williams views an_ up-
coming season. ‘Time was when he
was the big optimist. Able to count
the football players available to
the coaches on two hands, he’d say,
“We're going to be all right. We
just need a few breaks.” He said
it largely because he wanted very
badly to believe it himself, but if
he didn’t know it then, it’s plain
now that Williams was engaging in
some very wishful thinking.

Now, when the thinking is no
longer so wishful, it’s interesting to
note the tune that Williams
whistles. As for the 1961 pros-
pects, he'll tell you:

“Well, we’ve got some problems
at fullback and center, but other
than that we’re not too bad off. Of
course, we've got a real problem on
what to do with these sophomores.”’

What Williams means when he
talks about the problem at full-
back is this: Where is a third one
coming from as good as the two
that’ll be on hand? Barring injury
the Generals will have senior Doug
Martin, who gained 619 yards last
year—that’s 6.9 yards per carry—
and was named to the state AP
small-college all-star team. Also,

junior, who added 303 yards at
5.2 yards a try. He was the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch’s “back of
the week” following his starring

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

role against Carnegie Tech last
November.

At center, the problem is even
more “acute.” Here the Generals
only have a Little All-American
to hold down the first unit duties,
with a veteran letterman to back
him up. Terry Fohs, the all but in-
credible 145-pound mite who was
on everybody’s all-star team last
season, should have his best year
ever. If he does, he should be a
strong choice for the first team
Little All-American squad of the
Associated Press. He was a third
team selection in 1960. The second-
unit center is Jerry Hyatt, an ever-
improving hustler, and back of
him comes Don Jackson and soph-
more Mike Sheffey, both top boys.

And about those sophomores that
Williams says present a problem.
There will be some 20 of them, and
the problem which the coaches face
is how to get them their normal
share of experience and action on
a squad that will list 28 lettermen
from an undefeated 1960 team.

All of these troubles that are
bothering Boyd Williams are like-
ly to bring tears of sympathy to
the eyes of rival coaches, particu-
larly Joe McCutcheon, ’51, whose
Randolph-Macon team is the Gen-
erals’ Homecoming foe on October
14.

Seriously, Coach Lee McLaugh-
lin’s deep and experienced Gen-
erals face a tough assignment this
fall. All of the coaches admit that
the team will be better than in
1960 when only a tie with Johns
Hopkins marred an otherwise per-
fect record. But, as McLaughlin
points out, no matter how good a
team is, it has to be very lucky to
go undefeated.

“Looking back,’ reminds Mc-
Laughlin, “we got the big break
last year when it counted. If we
hadn’t had the luck when we
needed it, the season could have
been very differert indeed.”

‘The 1960-61 seasons in all sports
were, on the whole, good ones. The
track team was unbeaten in dual
competition, getting performances
from Jim Hickey that broke long-
standing school records in the 100
and 220-yard dashes. ‘The baseball
team surprised everybody by win-
ning eight, losing only four, large-
ly through the superb pitching of
senior Roy Carpenter. Only in soc-
cer, basketball, and lacrosse did
the Generals lose more games than
they won. Golf, swimming, and ten-
nis remained strong sports at Wash-
ington and Lee, even with beefed
up schedules.

In lacrosse, despite a 3-8 season,
the Generals could take some sat-
isfaction from the annual North-
South All-Star game played this
year at Annapolis. Billed as a “‘bat-
tle of the brothers” for the Civil
War Centennial, the game featured
Bill McHenry, ’54, and Bob Mc-
Henry, ’56, as coaches of the North
and South squads, respectively.
Little brother Bob’s talented
Southerners won, 12-6.

Bob coaches basketball and _ la-
crosse at Washington and Lee,
while Bill has been head_ lacrosse
coach at Williams College. In Sep-
tember he moves to Lebanon Val-
ley College as head football coach,
and next year Lebanon Valley
turns up as a football opponent on
the Generals’ schedule.

Spring Class Reunions

For 1961 Largest Ever

HE LARGEST TURNOUT by alumni
Pox the annual class reunions
were begun in 1955 was recorded
May 5-7 when 126 members of the
50th, goth, 25th, and 10th anniver-
sary classes assembled in Lexington.

Only in general reunion years
like 1954 and 1959 have there been
more alumni on campus for the
full schedule of social and other
activities. The response was gratify-
ing to members of the faculty and
administration who participated in

 

   

the Friday reception.

the three-day program and to the
faculty alumni committee and
other staff members who helped
plan the event.

The largest class representation
was from the 1951 “old boys,” al-
though sizeable contingents from
1936, 1921, and 1911 also were on
hand.

University officials attributed the
good attendance to the fastgrowing
popularity of the anniversary re-
unions among alumni, and also to

an increased desire on the part of
many former students to observe
first-hand recent progress and cur-
rent developments on the campus.

Several new features were added
to the 1961 program. President and
Mrs. Cole were host and hostess in
their home for a Friday afternoon
reception that lasted twice as long
as planned because of the unantici-
pated complexities of a change
from standard to daylight saving
time. And Friday evening the

The weekend weather was gen-
erally damp, canceling the sched-
uled baseball game with Lynch-
burg College but failing to slow the
all-weather alumni golfers who
took part in a reunion tournament
at the Lexington Golf course.

As always, the class banquets on
Saturday evening provided the
highlight of the reunion. Roger
Winborne was master of cere-
monies for the class of 1911, and
James “Gander” Bryan presided for
1921 at the Mayflower Hotel, while
Charlie Smith was in charge of
toasts and introductions at the
Robert E. Lee Hotel for 1936 class-
mates. At the Virginia House
Restuarant, Sam Hollis and Bill
Cogar agreed to a political truce
that permitted Hollis to act as
toastmaster there.

Following the banquets, a jam-
boree session for all classes was
held at the Robert E. Lee Hotel.

From the Alumni Fund Council

A Call For A Renewed Effort

HE ALUMNI FUND COUNCIL is
Guanes to report on the 1960-61
Alumni Fund to all Washington
and Lee men. This is a report of
the g9th year of annual alumni giv-
ing and is marked, once again, by
its concurrent operation with that
of the University Development
Program. It must be interpreted in
this light and with the realization
that this year’s fund was conducted
on a limited basis. The aim was
to solicit only those alumni who
were not currently under pledge to
the development campaign.

At the close of the fiscal year,
June 30, 1961, the Alumni Fund
had received support from 1,522
alumni, in the amount of $47,-
075.66. This does not include gifts
received during the year to the
University Development Program.
It is a record not only of generosity
but also of loyal and unselfish serv-
ice by the class agents, regional
chairmen, and their associates. It
is a privilege to serve Washington
and Lee, and surely these men de-
serve every credit and apprecia-
tion. ‘The unshakable loyalty and
the devoted response of all alumni,
not only to the Development Pro-
gram but also to the annual alumni
fund, are among the greatest re-
sources Washington and Lee posses-
ses with which to meet the future.

Speaking of the future, the pres-
ident of the Alumni Association,
addressing the General Meeting in
June, reminded us that alumni
serve their alma mater in many
ways, not the least of which is add-
ing honor to the University

SUMMER 10961

through their own character and
achievement. However, he added,
perhaps the greatest task is “the in-
tensive development of a systematic
and significant program of annual
giving on the part of all alumni
and friends of the University.” At
a time when many other colleges
and universities must grow large
and perhaps unwieldy, Washington
and Lee adheres to its proven phil-
osophy of educating well a limited
number of carefully selected young
men. We have a relatively small
alumni community of about 11,000.
If we cannot command the loyalty
of this comparatively small group,
the future for Washington and Lee
and its distinctive philosophy and
creed is clouded. Speaking very
practically, the great foundations
and corporations judge our Uni-
versity’s qualification for assistance,
in large measure, upon the con-
tinuing support received from
alumni. In the last full Alumni
Fund campaign (1957-58), the ef-
fectiveness of our solicitation—
those responding from total num-
ber solicited—was a participation
of 35.3 per cent. This is fine, but
suggests much to be desired when
measured against the 1959-60 rec-
ord of some sister institutions such
as Princeton’s 71.9 per cent, Dart-
mouth’s 64.9 per cent, Williams’
57 per cent, Yale’s 46 per cent, and
Johns Hopkins’ 44.6 per cent.
When a young man enrolls at
Washington and Lee, his invest-
ment of time and effort is our
sacred trust. All of our efforts are,
or should be, dedicated to assur-

ing the fullest possible dividend for
him. The alumni role in helping
Washington and Lee fulfill its mis-
sion is a significant one. Essentially,
it is a matter of a manifest interest
in the needs of Washington and
Lee through a participation in
th annual Alumni Fund. ‘Those
teachers and others who carry on
the work of our University need
yearly evidence that the vast ma-
jority of our alumni loyally sup-
port the aims and objectives of
Washington and Lee

With the thoughtful conviction
that all alumni who have partici-
pated in the Fund in the past will
continue to do so in the future
and with unswerving faith in the
bond between our University and
all of its sons, the Alumni Fund
Council has set a monetary goal
for the 1961-62 session of over
$r100,000.00 and a double or bet-
ter percentage of participation.
This, then, is a call to our loyalty.
We ask that you ponder with us
the needs of our university in the
future into which it moves. The
University deserves to know that an
even increasing number of alumni
are truly interested in its progress.
Every new contributor to the Alum-
ni Fund conveys this happy mes-
sage. The generosity of alumni
will assure that Washington and
Lee can maintain its high stand-
ards of quality in the education of
young men. We earnestly call upon
each of: you to make the 1961-62
Fund a.record contribution. Join
us in our confidence that it will be
just that.

Report of the Association President:

Gratitude for an Opportunity,

Challenge for the Future

T IS WITH A peculiar mixture of
I pride, pleasure and regret that
I make my report to the Washing-
ton and Lee Alumni Association—
pride in the honor that has been
mine this past year, pleasure in the
opportunity I have had to serve the
University which has given me so
much and the alumni who have
contributed to her greatness, and
regret that the limitations of time
and ability have prevented me from
doing all that I would have liked
to do. Fortunately, though their
time has also been limited, the abil-
ity of the other members of your

 

By PAUL M. SHUFORD
President, 1960-61

Board of ‘Trustees has more than
compensated for the lack on my
part. ‘hus, the past year has been
one of devotion and accomplish-
ment on the part of your Board.

As I am sure you can appreciate,
much of the work of the Board is
relatively routine. This is not to
say that it is not both necessary and
rewarding, but merely that it is
not the sort of thing which makes
for interesting listening. However,
there are several things I do deem
worthy of mention.

First, as you have heard, the
limited Alumni Fund Campaign,

Scene at Finals alumni luncheon

22

coupled with out alloted share of
the Development Fund, produced a
surplus which will be given over to
the University for general use. Next
year the Alumni Fund Committee
has recommended a return to a full
scale Alumni Fund campaign such
as had been conducted prior to the
Development Fund campaign. It is
my sincere hope that the results
will be the best and most gratifying
ever.

Secondly, it seems proper to men-
tion what has already been report-
ed to you through the Alumni
Magazine. ‘That is, that your Board
gave very thorough consideration
to a list of proposals presented to
last year’s meeting by Dr. Amos
Herold, and referred to the Board
for study. Dr. Herold’s proposals
were printed in the Fall issue of the
magazine, and the conclusions and
actions were printed in a_subse-
quent issue. Upon consideration of
all relevant factors most of these
proposals were deemed to be not
in the best interest of the Univer-
sity (to the services of which our
charter commits us;) a lesser num-
ber of his proposals were for pro-
cedures already in effect; and one
or two were held over for possible
later consideration, pending future
developments.

Thirdly, I would like to say that

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

the matter of an alumni or alumni-
faculty house has been kept before
the University’s Board of ‘Trustees
for their consideration. As you
probably know, such a facility has
a definite place in the University’s
development program, and we are
all looking forward to the day
when it becomes a reality. How-
ever, I must say in all candor, that
your Board did not feel it could
conscientiously insist that it be put
before other obvious needs of the
University, such as additional and
remodeled class and _ laboratory
facilities, additional dormitory
space, and an enlarged law library,
to mention only some. While I feel
certain that your Board will con-
tinue to place this matter at or near
the top of its list of desirable pro-
jects, and will do its best to bring
it to fruition, it seems proper that
we should cooperate fully with the
University’s Board of Trustees in
the total development program.
There is no lack of sympathy
there—I can assure you—for every
member of that Board, with the ob-
vious exception of Mrs. duPont, is
also an alumnus of Washington
and Lee.

Finally, as was mentioned at last
year’s meeting, there has been a
committee at work drafting pro-
posals for certain changes in our
charter and by-laws. ‘This commit-
tee has concluded its task, at least
for the time being, and the Board
has recommended for your adop-
tion several changes which will be
presented to you shortly. Briefly
these changes concern:

(1) Enlarging your Board of
Trustees and lengthening the
tenure of individual members in
order to bring about greater
alumni representation and in-
terest and to better enable those
members to render effectual ser-
vice.

(2) Redefine the classification
of “alumnus” for greater simplic-
ity and to bring the present clas-

sification into line with what has

tice of the Association, and

(3) Redefine the title and cer-
tain duties of the alumni secre-
tary.

Before concluding I would ask
your indulgence to submit one per-
sonal thought. Individual alumni
serve their alma mater in many
ways—by contributions to the
Alumni Fund, by developing the
interest of others, particularly pros-
pective students in W&L, and cer-
tainly not least of all, by adding
honor to the University through
their own characters and achieve-
ments. However, it has been my
growing conviction that the great-
est task of the Alumni Association,

 

M. SHUFORD, ’43

as an organization, is or should be
the intensive development of a sys-
tematic and significant program of
giving on the part of all alumni
and friends of the University. I
would not for one moment detract
from the fine record that has been
established, but I feel we have only
“scratched the surface,” if I may use
a metaphor. It is my hope, far-
fetched as some may think it to be,
that in the not too distant future
W&L would have a scholarship en-
dowment or contribution program
sufficient to say that no worthy ap-
plicant need ever seek another col-
lege simply because of a lack of
funds. ‘This will obviously require
greater effort and sacrifice on the
part of all of us but I feel that
Washington and Lee alumni are
equal to any task when properly
motivated and organized. ‘The mo-
tivation is already here—our_ be-
loved University. More intensive
and extensive effort at organizing
is what I bespeak to succeeding
Board members and officers, and
to the officers and members of the
various chapters and classes. As
with Rome, this will not be done
in a day, but here is our challenge
for. the: future:

In closing may I sincerely thank
each and every alumnus, and _ par-
ticularly the members of the Board
and our executive secretary, Bill
Washburn, for their unfailing sup-
port and assistance. You have made
my tenure as President one of real
joy and satisfaction.

The Executive Secretary's Report:

A Busy Year of Reunions,
Chapter Visits, Fund Activity

NCE AGAIN IN THIS annual re-
QO port I am happy to say that
your alumni association is healthy
and continues to progress. In all
areas the growth and development
has been evident. Briefly, 1 would
like to mention a few of the major
programs.

Last year at this time there were
97 active chapters in the associa-
tion. Today we have 40 such chap-
ters and there is one more which is
on the verge, so to speak, of becom-
ing activated soon. By next fall it
will be in full operation. While the
establishing of new chapters is tak-
en with some caution, the associa-
tion is eager to assist in this de-
velopment wherever there is the
need or the desire expressed. ‘The
three newly organized chapters
have gotten off to a splendid start—
several meetings have been held
and in the one case of Wilmington,
Delaware, the chapter arranged a
splendid spring program with the
W&L Glee Club. Organizationally,
then, I think we are on the move
at the proper speed. As secretary, I
have personally attended meetings
in 31 of these 40 chapters, traveling
from New York to San Antonio;
from Norfolk to St. Louis; from
Miami to Chicago. Members of the
faculty and administration have
also been to several other chapters.

24

By WILLIAM C. WASHBURN

Executive Secretary

All of these visitations attest to the
fact that the alumni chapters are
active and energetic and are per-
forming a good service for the Uni-
versity.

We are all familiar with the Unti-
versity Development Program and
its fine achievements evidenced by
the new buildings which are now
under way. Jim Whitehead, his
staff, and Dr. Cole have been ex-
tremely helpful to all chapters this
year and I should like to just pause
here long enough to publicly de-
clare our many thanks on behalf
of the Alumni Association for all
their good assistance and coopera-
tion. The University Development
Program has brought and is still
bringing a renewed interest and
vigor to our chapters and to the
alumni. The culmination of this
task, so well executed, is a tribute
to the University Development
team as well as to the alumni.

In addition to the University De-
velopment capital campaign, the
Alumni Fund was reactivated this
year under a limited operation,
The Fund Council, headed by Lin-
wood Holton, has held several
meetings during the year and has
directed the fund to a point at
which we can all be proud. As
ordered by the Council, the Fund
appeal was, again this year, made

only to those alumni who were not
still under pledge or payment to
the University Development Pro-
gram. The sincere effort was not to
“double-up” on anyone. The pro-
gram, even on this limited scale,
now consumes a great part of our
effort. Last year on a very small
scale the Alumni Fund managed to
accumulate approximately $20,000.
This year we have reached, as of
May 27, $45,325.00 from 1,431 con-
tributors. ‘The fiscal year ends June
30. Whatever success the Fund
achieves this year can be credited
largely to the 93 class agents, the
43 regional agents and the scores
of committeemen serving in our
behalf. ‘These men have given not
only of their resources but, more
important, of their time and ener-
gy to make our Fund a success. For
this next year the Alumni Fund
Council has directed a full and
complete campaign: goals of 4,000
contributors and $100,000.00 have
been set. We urge each and every
alumnus conscientiously to share
in this effort.

Our annual Anniversary Class
Reunions are getting larger each
year. Last year we instituted the
1oth anniversary reunion and this
year we had over 50 back from the
class of 1951. The total number in
the four classes was half again as

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

many as last year. The men
thoroughly enjoy seeing the college
in session and having the oppor-
tunity to participate in the future
programs of the university. Of
course, stories of all kinds abound
on all sides and there is much rem-
iniscing, all of which results in a
more dedicated and sincerely in-
terested alumnus.

The Alumni Magazine had a few
face changes this year. We hope
they have improved its readability.
It continues to be our widest chan-
nel of communication between
alumni and the University. Quar-
terly this magazine is sent to a
mailing list of approximately
10,700 (including some 135 over-
seas) with the hope of keeping you
informed on the news and affairs
of the University as well as your
classmates and college friends. My
deep appreciation goes to Mrs. Jef-
frey, our managing editor, and to
Mr. Lauck of our Printing Labora-
tory for all their interest and co-
operation. Without their patience
and understanding nothing would
get out. In the years ahead we will
continue to try to give you a maga-
zine of which we can all be proud.

There are quite a number of
others facets in alumni work. I'll
not take time to elaborate on them.
One program for next year how-
ever needs mentioning. We will at-
tempt in this year to establish what
might be called an Ocupational
File of alumni. It is an effort,
through submitted questionnaires
and by use of our IBM system, to
classify each alumnus into an es-
tablished set of occupational cate-
gories. In this way we can then de-
termine who and how many doctors
we have, or ministers, or bankers,

or ranchers, etc.

More and more the public is ask-
ing the colleges and universities
to prove themselves in the products
they produce. We think the Occu-
pational File will not only be help-
ful and informative but will also
be a means of proving Washington

SUMMER 1961

and Lee does indeed have an en-
viable record. Let me urge each of
you to respond fully to this pro-
gram.

Now briefly some of the other
facets: In our student relations area
we participate at freshman camp
and award a prize to the boy who
upholds the tradition of knowing
the most names of his classmates;
Homecoming, wherein we award
four prizes to the winners of the
fraternity house decorations con-
test; our senior banquet each year.
All of these activities are of tremen-
dous value and grow increasingly
important.

In closing, let me say that I have
truly enjoyed this past year of pro-

gress and look forward with eager
pleasure to the coming year. It is
always difficult and dangerous to
extend thanks to all who have
helped, for I am most fearful of
overlooking someone. But first let
me congratulate you on your asso-
ciation officers who have given so
unselfishly of their time and _tal-
ents. ‘To the administration and
faculty, to the Development Office,
the Faculty-Alumni Committee,
chapter officers, class and regional
agents, and in fact just about every
alumnus, I extend my very deep
appreciation.

And to my office staff—I’m sure
they’ll best understand—my simple
but most profound “thanks.”

Homecoming and Openings:

The Same Big Weekend

OR THE FIRST TIME in many
FE years, Homecoming weekend
will coincide with Opening Dances.
A student steering committee has
been working with Executive Sec-
retary Bill Washburn and will con-
fer later with the Alumni Faculty
Committee in more detail. ‘The
date is set as October 13-14 and
promises to be one of the most col-
orful weekends in the college year.

In addition to the fraternity
house decoration contest, a pep-
rally is planned for Friday evening
in Doremus gymnasium and will
be followed by the jazz session of
Opening Dances. The bands have
not yet been named, but the Dance
Board promises its usual caliber of
outstanding entertainment.

Registration of alumni will be-
gin Saturday morning in the Stu-
dent Union Building. The day’s
program includes a morning Cof-
fee Hour and the Alumni Lunch-
eon in Evans Dining Hall before

the afternoon festivities. The kick-
off for the Generals’ game against
the Yellow Jackets of Randolph-
Macon will begin at 2 pm.,,
brightened with all the color of the
Homecoming queen and her court.
A reception for all alumni and
guests is planned immediately fol-
lowing Saturday’s game, and that
evening the formal dance will be-
gin at g p.m. with Openings figure
taking place at approximately 10
p-m.

There is no more beautiful time
of the year to visit the Shenandoah
Valley than Mid-October. The col-
or of the foliage and the color of
Homecoming will blend to provide
an unforgettable weekend for alum-
ni. A word of caution, however,
must be entered. Because of the
combination attractions for the
weekend and the limited hotel
space, room reservations should be
made well in advance. Everything
points to a great time. Try to make
it if you can.
