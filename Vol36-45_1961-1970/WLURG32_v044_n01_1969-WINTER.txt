a Washington and Lee alumni will have the Opportunity soon to
nominate an alumnus for election to the University Board of Trustees
on a term membership basis.

The concept of a term alumni member was approved in principle
by the Board of Trustees at its October meeting. The Board sub-
sequently will expand its membership to accommodate the revolving
alumni member.

The Board invited the Alumni Board of Directors to proceed with
its plan for nominating the alumnus to be presented for election by
the Trustees. As outlined by Alumni Association President Fred
Bartenstein, the plan provides for a nominee to be selected by mail
ballot by alumni of record. They will vote for one of five candidates
chosen by the Alumni Board of Directors.

Alumni representation, in the view of the Trustees, will involve
alumni more positively in the University’s programs and_ policies,
and will open an additional channel of communication between
alumni and the Board of Trustees.

The mechanics of the election are being worked out by the
Alumni Board of Directors. Alumni will be notified by mail about
the procedures to be followed.

 

 

a John W. Warner, a partner in the Washington, D.C. law firm of
Hogan & Hartson, has been elected to membership on the Board of
Trustees of Washington and Lee, according to an announcement by Dr.
Huston St. Clair, rector of the board.

Warner, 41, is a 1949 graduate of the University, with a B.S. degree
in physics-engineering. He received his LL.B. degree from the University
of Virginia Law School in 1953.

Warner is the son of a distinguished Washington and Lee alumnus,
the late Dr. John W. Warner, who received his B.A. degree in 1903 and
later practiced medicine in Washington, D.C. Since 1961, a special endow-
ment known as the J. W. Warner, M.D. Scholarship Fund has provided
financial aid to deserving Washington and Lee upperclassmen majoring
in pre-medical study who “possess those exceptional qualifications, aca-
demic and otherwise, needed to accept the immense responsibility and
challenge of serving mankind through medicine.”

Washington and Lee’s new trustee was admitted to the Bar of the
District of Columbia in 1959, serving first as law clerk to the Honorable
E. Barrett Prettyman, former chief judge of the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and then joining
the law firm of McKenny, Flannery, & Craighill.

From 1955 to 1960, Warner was an assistant U. S. Attorney for the
District of Columbia, serving in all trial and appellate divisions of the

U. S. Attorney’s Office, and concluding with two years in the Criminal
Division trial staff for the U. S. District Court.

Later in 1960, Warner joined Hogan & Hartson as an associate in
the firm’s banking-corporate department. He became a general partner
in 1964.

In 1960, Warner established the “Prettyman Internship Program” at
Georgetown University, a pilot project to provide qualified counsel for
indigent criminal defendants. Each year, six honor graduates from leading
law schools were selected for a course of study in trial practice, and upon
admission to a Bar these students regularly accepted court appointments
as defense counsel, a requisite for the Master’s Degree awarded by George-
town University.

After five years of successful operation under funding by Mr. and
Mrs. Warner, the Georgetown program was enlarged and taken over by
the Ford Foundation.

Earlier this year, Warner was elected to the Board of Trustees of
the District of Columbia Bar Foundation. He also serves as a member
of the Corporate and Banking Committee of the D. C. Bar Association. |
He is a member of the American Bar Association, and he is affiliated”
with the World Peace Through Law Center and the Foreign Policy |
Association.

Warner brings to Washington and Lee’s board experience gained as
a member of the Board of Trustees of George Washington University.
In addition to the two university board memberships, he serves on the
governing board of the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation (the
Episcopal Cathedral, Mount St. Albans, Washington, D.C.), and he is
a trustee of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond.

He also has served on the boards of the D. C. Chapter of the American
Red Cross, the Federal City Council, Beauvoir School, and the United
Givers Fund for the District of Columbia. He is a director and former
chairman of the executive committee of the Greater Washington Investors,
Inc., a publicly-owned investment company.

Warner’s military service includes duty as a U.S. Navy enlisted manj
from 1944 to 1946, and commissioned service as a Marine first lieutenant
communications officer with Marine Air Group 33 in Korea in 1950

 

and 1951.
Warner is married to the former Catherine Conover Mellon of Upper-

ville, Va. They now reside in Washington with their three children—John,
IV 6, Virginia 8, and Mary 9. .

SATURDAY CLASSES ABOLISHED

ON THE MATTER OF
MARIJUANA

Law SCHOOL GIFT

President Huntley addresses students on
marijuana drawbacks

 

JANUARY 1969

a The University’s faculty has
adopted a five-day week class sched-
ule for undergraduates, the change
to become effective at the start of
the second semester in February.

The plan affects some 1,270 stu-
dents, and most likely will affect
about 185 more if the School of
Law adopts it after a study now
under way.

The five-day week of classes,
Monday through Friday, will re-
place the current six-day schedule
with its unpopular Saturday morn-
ing meetings.

To compensate for the lost morn-
ing of classes, the faculty has
lengthened periods’ from 50
minutes to 55 minutes, with a five-
minute break. Morning classes will
now start at 8 a.m., rather than
the previous 8:25, and will end at
the usual 1 p.m. hour.

Afternoon classes and_ labora-
tories remain the same, from 2 p-m.
to 4:40 p.m.

Among the reasons cited for
adopting the five-day week were its
general acceptance in today’s so-
ciety, a desire to make a full Satur-
day available to faculty and _stu-
dents for study and leisure, and
the fact that traveling Washington
and Lee athletic teams would not
have to miss as much school.

m Speaking before a special Uni-
versity assembly in early December,
President Robert E. R. Huntley
called for each student to ‘make a
responsible individual decision’
against the use of marijuana so that
“the University will not be diverted
from those things which are truly
important.”

In what he termed was a personal
statement, he said he was not
prompted by an event or series
of events on this campus, but by
information regarding the “grow-
ing acceptance of marijuana among
students.”

Huntley suggested a number of
reasons why restraint should be
practiced, citing the drug’s illeg-

ality, its counter-productive tend-
encies, and its nature as a vice.
Huntley hoped that the use
of marijuana would not become a
serious problem on the Washington
and Lee campus, thereby “causing
us to be preoccupied with a situa-
tion that would divert us from the
important tasks we face.’

a» A distribution of $128,309 has
been received by the University as
its share in the estate of the late
Jasper J.. Barrett of San Diego,
Calif., a 1gio graduate of the
School of Law.

President Robert E. R. Huntley
said the University will, in accord-
ance with wishes expressed in Bar-
rett’s will, use the bequest to es-
tablish and maintain within the
School of Law’s library a special
collection dealing with probate
law, trusts, estate planning, taxa-
tion, and related subjects.

Any remaining portion of the be-
quest not required for library pur-
poses will be used to establish one
or more scholarships for deserving
law students, President Huntley
added.

Barrett, who engaged in private
practice in San Diego, died two
years ago at the age of 85. He was
a native of Maury, Va., and prac-
ticed law in Astoria, Ore. before
locating in San Diego.

Law School Dean Roy L. Stein-
heimer said that actual expendi-
ture of the Barrett funds will wait
upon completion of a study now
under way regarding expanded
physical facilities for the Law
School. With current enrollment
nearly 200 students, classroom and
library space in Tucker Hall has
become inadequate, Dean Stein-
heimer said.

The current study, which in-
cludes analysis of curricular offer-
ings and the optimum Law School
enrollment, is expected to suggest
the kind of physical facilities need-
ed to accommodate the school ade-
quately, Dean Steinheimer added.

HINKLE AND HALFORD
CANDIDATES FOR
RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS

Lee Halford (left) and Sam Hinkle

 

The School of Law was one of
four areas of high-priority physical
requirements cited by President
Huntley in his recent inaugural re-
marks. Others include the gymnas-
ium, the School of Commerce and
Administration, and the Library.

= T’wo outstanding seniors were
endorsed for Rhodes Scholarships
by the University faculty.

Both Samuel D. Hinkle, IV of
Shelbyville, Ky. and M. Lee Hal-
ford, Jr. of Richardson, Tex. have
a lot in common, including long
lists of impressive credentials, both
academic and extra-curricular.

They were entered from their
native states in the competition
with scholars from a number of
other U.S. colleges and universities
for the coveted scholarships to Eng-
land’s Oxford University.

Top scholar in his class, Hinkle
has made straight A’s throughout
his 314 years at Washington and
Lee. He is a member of Phi Beta
Kappa and received its Sophomore
Award for Scholarship. He has
played varsity football for four

years and is captain of the track
team, where last year he had the
best marks in the 440, mile relay,
440 relay, and 100- and 20-yard
dashes.

Hinkle is chairman of the 1969
CONTACT symposium, which an-
nually brings national figures to
the campus for lectures and dis-
cussion with students. He is a
dormitory counselor, vice presi-
dent of Omicron Delta Kappa
leadership fraternity, secretary of
the Varsity Club, an officer in Delta
Tau Delta social fraternity, and has
served on the student government
executive committee.

Halford ranks third in his class
academically and is a member of
Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron
Delta Kappa. As a member of the
student government executive com-
mittee, he headed committees
which advised the University’s
Board of Trustees in the selection
of a new president, and dealt with
changes in the examinaion schedule
and with University housing and
development.

A pitcher on the Generals’ var-
sity baseball team, Halford has won
letters the last two years. He also
has been president of the Young
Democrats, and treasurer of his
class and of Beta Theta Pi social
fraternity.

Credentials such as these led Dr.
James G. Leyburn, chairman of the
Rhodes Scholarship committee, to
comment that “if the nominating
committees find other candidates
superior to these men, we can only
say that the United States is hand-
somely supplied with splendid
young men.”

If selected by the Rhodes Scholar-
ship committee, both Hinkle and
Halfard would have studied ‘“Mod-
ern Greats,” a program embracing
philosophy, politics, and economics.

Washington and Lee has had
eight Rhodes Scholars, the last one
Timothy A. Vanderver, Jr. of Birm-
ingham, Ala., who was selected in
1964.

a
Campus speaker Robert Bierstedt

JANUARY 1969

a Several distinguished speakers
have made appearances at the Uni-
versity since the start of the school
year. A list of the lecturers and
their topics follows: Prof. O. W.
Riegel of the Department of Jour-
nalism and Communications—an
analysis of Czechoslovakia and the
current situation in Eastern Eu-
rope; Lawrence Speiser, director of
the American Civil Liberties Un-
ion’s Washington office—‘‘Law and

and the Politician in Recent Ameri-
can Politics’; and Samuel E. Car-
penter, chairman of the Republican
Party of Virginia—comments on
the 1969 gubernatorial race in Vir-
ginia and opportunities for young
people in the Republican Party.

wm Several nationally prominent
men will add to the speaker list
in the near future. South Dakota
Sen. George McGovern and civil
rights leader Charles Evers will
talk and meet with students in Feb-
ruary, appearing at the four-day
student - sponsored — symposium,
CONTACT.

Also on the program will be Phil-
lipe Labro, one of France’s leading

journalist and a Washington and
Lee alumnus, and Dr. John R. Sil-
ber, dean of students at the Uni-
versity of Texas.

Plans are under way to obtain
several other prominent persons for
the symposium, said Sam D. Hin-
kle, IV, a senior from Shelbyville,
Ky. and chairman of the CON-
TACT committee for the student
Interfraternity Council, which
sponsors the event.

CONTACT was initiated in
1965 as an annual symposium on
public issues. Since then, it has
debated the problems of the cities,
the “Establishment,” and the Re-
publican Party, and has brought
such men as Sen. Barry Goldwater,
Sen. Thruston Morton, author
‘Tom Wolfe, the New York Times’
Tom Wicker, author Claude
Brown, Alabama’s Richmond Flow-
ers, and former CORE. director
James Farmer to the campus.

The theme for the 1968 sym-
posium will be ‘Power.”’

In April, Clark Kerr, president
of the University of California at
Berkeley during the widespread
student unrest there several years
ago, will be in Lexington to discuss
“Higher Education and Its Discon-
tents.”

His appearance at Jackson Me-
morial Hall on the VMI campus
is being sponsored jointly by Wash-
ington and Lee and VMI through
the visiting scholars program of
the University Center in Virginia.

a Pittsburgh industrialist David D.
Johnson has been appointed chair-
man of the Robert E. Lee Associ-
ates, a recently-organized associa-
tion of devoted and _ generous
friends of Washington and Lee.
Johnson’s appointment as the
group's first chairman was made by
the University’s Board of Trustees,
which earlier this year established
the Lee Associates to recognize and
honor its most loyal benefactors.
The Lee Associates provide not
only substantial financial support

Pittsburgh and serves as vice presi-
dent and director of the Claude
Worthington Benedum_ Founda-
tion. He is a director of the Pitts-
burgh National Bank.

A 1921 graduate of Washington
and Lee, Johnson received his law
degree from the University two
years later. He is a former president
of the Alumni Association and
served as vice chairman of the Al-
umni House Campaign in 1965-66.

a Richard T. Scruggs, Sr. of Birm-
ingham has been elected chairman
of the Parents’ Advisory Council.

Scruggs, whose son, Richard, Jr.,
is a junior majoring in physics-en-
gineering, was named at the an-
nual council meeting held in con-
nection with the 14th Parents’
Weekend Nov. 1-3.

The council sponsors the annual
weekend, along with the Univer-
sity. The three-day event, which
this year was attended by a record
number of 1,300 parents and guests,
enables parents to meet their son's
professors, attend classes, tour the
campus, view departmental dis-
plays, and observe numerous other
activities.

Scruggs is president of Vulcan
Metals Co. in Birmingham. As
chairman, he will preside during
Parents’ Weekend next fall at the
annual council meeting and the
“Report to Parents” session.

Scruggs succeeds John F. Carrere,
Sr. of New Orleans, who has two
sons at the University—senior John,
Jr. and sophomore Michael.

s A faster computer with broaden-
ed capabilities for research and
other activities has been installed
at the University.

The new 1130 replaces the 1620
model, which was in_ use at Wash-
ington and Lee since early 1962.
Both are manufactured by IBM.

Dr. John H. Wise, chairman of
the University’s computer commit-
tee, said the latest machine will
provide increased storage capabili-
ties, have a faster computing speed,
and provide additional program
ming features.

With its magnetic disc memory
bank, the new computer will be
used for some research projects pre-
viously impractical, Dr. Wise said.
It also will be possible to operate
the computer by remote control
from campus locations other than
the computer center building.

Washington and Lee first instal-
led IBM machines in 1960 for use
in registration, grade reports, and
other statistical data. In 1962, the
1620 was installed, the first of its
kind in a Virginia college. It shared
its work load about equally be-
tween administrative functions,
such as student records and month-
ly payrolls, and classwork and re-
search activities.

a Sandy Zimmerman, a senior com-
merce major from Larchmont,
N.Y., has been named acting sta-
tion manager of the University’s
FM radio station, WLUR.

He replaces, for a temporary but
indefinite period, station manager
Charles E. Winston, instructor in
journalism who is recovering from
emergency eye surgery at Johns
Hopkins Hospital.

Prof. Paxton Davis, chairman of
the Department of Journalism and
Communications, says Zimmer-
man’s appointment carries “full
authority’ over day-to-day opera-
tions.

w A freak broadcast signal that
permits an alumnus in Lynchburg
to hear the University’s low power
FM educational radio station has
been translated into an annual gift
of some $2,700 for support of the
Station’s activities.

Richard E. Gooch, a 1930 grad-
uate of Washington and Lee and
a former Lynchburg radio broad-
casting executive, has established
an endowment which will be ap-
plied toward yearly operating ex-
penses and equipment purchase
for WLUR-FM.

A laboratory of the Department
of Journalism and Communica-
tions, WLUR broadcasts nightly
during the week from 7 to 11 p.m.
and on Saturdays from 1 to g p.m.
It began operation in February,
1967.

Gooch says that WLUR’s signal
comes to his Lynchburg home
“clear as a bell,” but he knows of
no others in Lynchburg who re-
ceive the station, clear or otherwise.
‘The 10-watt station would norm-
ally have a broadcast range of about

two miles from its antenna on the
top of Reid Hall.

Gooch, for whom radio and tape
recording now constitute an active
hobby, tapes most of WLUR’s
transmissions. Because of his back-
ground in broadcasting and _ his
close ties with Washington and
Lee, Gooch is a frequent visitor to
the campus studios of WLUR and
serves as an unofficial adviser to
station manager Charles E. Win-
ston.

Gooch and others at the Univer-
sity are at a loss to explain the rea-
son behind his steady, strong recep-
tion of WLUR more than 4o miles
from Lexington, although freak
bounces of signals are known to oc-
cur occasionally in both radio and
television transmissions.

Whatever the reason, Winston
and Prof. Paxton Davis, head of
the Department of Journalism and

Communications—appreciative of

Gooch’s interest and support—hope
the phenonmenon continues.

a Forty-two students are undertak-
ing research projects at Washing-
ton and Lee this year under the
University’s unique program of
grants-in-aid—the Robert E. Lee
Research Program.

In the sciences, a student uses
the University telescope to study
magnetic storms on the sun, and
another is busy identifying plants
found on the Washington and Lee
campus. A student artist works
with his professor in preparing an
art instruction book.

In the School of Commerce and
Administration, an economic ma-
jor studies the merger of the Penn-
Central Railroad. One student,
David W. Hardee III of Green-
ville, N.C., is undertaking two
projects—a study of the Negro in
marketing strategy for his com-
merce professor, and a Southeast
Asian bibliography for his instruc-
tor in history.

What makes the research projects
unique is that they are often on
the graduate school level, yet under-
taken by undegraduates who work
closely with their professors. The
projects may originate with the
student or with a faculty member
who wants a student assistant to
help in one of his research under-
takings. No course credit is given.

There is probably no program
quite like it on any other college
campus. It was begun in 1960
through a gift of more than $250,-
ooo from an alumnus, the late Dr.
Gustavus Benz Capito of Charles-
ton, W. Va. Other funds have since
been used to supplement it.

500 students have participated in
over 400 projects, receiving grants-
in-aid ranging from less than $100
to nearly $1,000 for several students
working together on a_ single
project.

a Ed Schiff keeps going further
south in pursuit of his legal career.

A native New Yorker, he gradu-
ated from Penn State University
and now is a senior law student at
Washington and Lee. His next stop
will be in New Orleans, where he
will be law clerk to Federal Judge
John Minor Wisdom of the 5th
Circuit Court of Appeals, a Trus-
tee of the University.

Judge Wisdom’s offer is quite an
honor for a person still in law
school, not to mention the advan-
tage of starting a legal profession
that near the top. Schiff is presi-
dent of the Student Bar Associa-
tion and will be editor-in-chief of
the Washington and Lee Law Re-
view during the second semester.

a A program of films made by stu-
dents at the University has been
compiled for showing at area col-
leges, particularly those with
cinema clubs.

Entitled “An Evening of Wash-
ington and Lee Films,” the pro-
gram was put together by Prof.
O. W. Riegel of the Department
of Journalism and Communica-
tions. They were made by his stu-
dents as a class project for a course
in the history, techniques, and
effects of motion pictures.

Prof. Riegel introduces the mov-
les with a short resume of film-
making at the University. The
program was first presented at Hol-
lins, sponsored by the Cinema Club
there.

Five films made up the initial
program, dating to Barton de
Palma’s “Gray Rain” (1959). Others
are Warren Stewart‘’s “A Young
Man’s Fancy” and Roger Redman’s
“Botany US 5,” both made in 1967,

and two made just last spring,
“Spe Lurk” by Ed Dodd: and
“Om,” by Don Ellis.

a Christopher H. Mills, a senior
from Denver, has been awarded a
Rotary Foundation Fellowship for
a year’s study in France.

Mills will spend the 1969-70 aca-
demic session at the University of
Grenoble. He will live with a local
Rotary family there, under the pro-
gram’s goal of promoting and
encouraging international under-
standing and good will.

An honor roll and dean’s list
student, Mills is active in debating,
is a member of Phi Beta Kappa and
Phi Eta Sigma honorary fraternities
for scholarship, and a participant
in the Robert E. Lee Research
Program.

# Keith Shillington’s latest accom-
plishment—simply the latest among
many—is an adaptation of a Greek
tragedy for presentation on the
stage.

Shillington——chemistry _ profes-
sor, amateur actor, crowner of
Homecoming Queens, and definite-
ly an Irishman—“freely adapted”
Euripides’ The Bacchants for pre-
sentation in mid-December by the
‘Troubadours, the University theat-
rical group.

Writing in his spare time from
duties as professor of chemistry,

Shillington spent approximately
two months on his version of the
play.

He described it as ‘‘freely adapt-
ed for publication” and “not a
translation.” A literal translation,
he pointed out, leads to stilted Eng-
lish, whereas the original was in
lyrical Greek language.

“What I did was to recast the
play in theatrical English poetry.
As I wrote I had in mind an actor
standing on the stage and reciting
these lines,’ he said.

Since Shillington does not read
Greek, he relied on other transla-
tions, plus one original Greek ver-

s Virginia’s history from the end
of the Civil War to the election of
Gov. Harry F. Byrd is the sub-
ject of a new book by Washington
and Lee University Prof. Allen W.
Moger.

Virginia: Bourbonism to Byrd,
1870-1925 went on sale December
Ad,

The book details debt policy and
the neglect of the new “free pub-
lic schools” which brought William
Mahone and his Readjuster Party
to control from 1879-83, thus forc-
ing a complete reorganization of
the Conservative-Democratic Party
into the Democratic organization
so familiar to present-day Virgini-
ans—the strongest and most famous
political group in the state's histo-
ry.

Prominent in the story is the
career of Thomas Staples Martin,
who fashioned the organization
known for over two decades as the
“Martin machine’ and who was
succeeded, after his death in 1919,
by Harry F. Byrd as the organiza-
tion’s leader.

Dr. Moger has many close ties
to his native Virginia. He was born
in Eclipse in Nansemond County
and grew up in Newport News. He
is a graduate of Randolph-Macon
College in Ashland and received
his master’s and Ph.D. degrees at
Columbia University.

A recent article in the Richmond
Times-Dispatch said: ‘All in all,
Virginia: Bourbonism to Byrd is a
scholarly and readable work which

makes a genuine contribution to
our understanding of a significant

Department of Sociology is one of
the major contributors to the first
comprehensive reference work of
the social sciences to appear in
more than 30 years.

His article, a biography of Wil-
liam Graham Sumner, is contained
in the International Encyclopedia
of the Social Sciences, a 17-volume
reference work that represents
seven years of scholarly colabora-
tion by 1,505 social science special-
ists from 33 nations.

The new encyclopedia, publish-
ed by The Macmillan Co. and The
Free Press, provides a codification
of present knowledge and theory in
the social sciences and_ related
fields. It covers all the principal
disciplines, including anthropology,
economics, geography, history, law,
political science, psychiatry, psy-
chology, sociology, and statistics.

ses Vellinho.

In addition to translating the
work, Dr. and Mrs. Barrett added
more than 60 notes to explain

‘THE

12

Honor SYSTEM:
Semper Idem?

 

Neil Kessler

That a gentleman does not lie,
cheat, or steal is a Washington and
Lee tradition. Simply, it is the
Honor System, a century-old institu-
tion in itself that has been accepted
without question, perhaps because
of fear but most of all out of respect
for its excellence of ideal and spirit,
these many years.

Now there are questions, most of
them concerning jurisdiction and
procedural matters. The main
issues specifically deal with vague-
ness in how far the Honor System
extends and what mechanics should
be followed during an honor case.

Senior Neil Kessler, Friday edi-
tion editor of the Ring-tum Phi,
takes a brief look at the situation
in an article that should be of
particular interest to alumni.

For 100 years, Washington and
Lee students have attempted to
govern their curricular and indi-
vidual lives by a set of principles
called the Honor System. Based up-
on the ideal that every member of
the student body is ipso facto a
gentleman and will live as a gentle-
man, the System seldom has been
challenged, and its form has re-
mained practically intact since its
inception.

Throughout this school year,
though, there have been severe
challenges to certain aspects of the
Honor System. In particular, ques-
tions concerning the jurisdiction of
the System have been raised—does
it pertain just to work which will
be graded, or does it involve all
facets of life while attending Wash-
ington and Lee?

The functioning of the System’s
procedure also has come under
examination. Should the Executive
Committee be the proper channel
to determine whether the Honor
System has been violated? Is there
anything wrong with the procedure
before an open trial, where a stu-
dent may appeal the EC’s decision
only before students and faculty?

Two such open trials within the
past three years have caused con-
siderable anxiety, consternation,
and alarm, and possibly a lack
of confidence in the Executive
Committee.

Freshman law student H. Wil-
liam Walker, Jr. wrote in the Ring-
tum Phi not long ago his thoughts
about jurisdiction: “...why do we
cling tenaciously to an ideal (being
a gentleman in daily social conduct
as well as daily classroom conduct)
which we do not even attempt to
realize? Common conduct defines
our repudiation of these century-
old norms, yet we insist on paying
them lip service... If we are not
going to govern our social conduct
by the traditional norms, then let
us stop echoing these norms.”

This does not mean that Mr.
Walker and other students who
agree with him want to set up a
system of social amorality. What it
does mean is that many students
are hypocritical in claiming to fol-
low the Honor System per se, fall-
ing short in such practices as pur-
chasing liquor at the ABC store
before they are 21, asking a friend
for the spelling of a word without
giving proper credit in a paper,
or walking into a big weekend
concert without paying.

In addition, Walker wanted to
show that some students apparently
even doubted that the Honor Sys-
tem really worked. He quoted facts
from a 1966 poll, printed in the
Ring-tum Phi, by Robert E. Lee,
Jr. Although Lee’s results were
approximate, they showed some
falterings in the System. The poll
was based on the answers of juniors
and seniors in three fraternities—
one whose academic standing was
consistently near the top, one con-
sistently in the middle, and one
consistently at the bottom.

Seventy-seven per cent of those
polled admitted violations of what
they considered to be “the letter
of the law.” Of these, only 36 per
cent felt they had violated “the

spirit of the system.’’ On another
matter, just 37 per cent said they
would report fraternity brothers
they saw committing a violation,
but 66 per cent claimed they would
report someone they did not know
or like.

Therefore, it appears that some
Washington and Lee students fail
to measure up to the social and
legal standards they claim to fol-
low through the Honor System.

Larry Honig, Tuesday edition
editor of the Ring-tum Phi, ex-
presses hope that the current prob-
lems can be worked out: “Its
(Honor System) implementation
may fall short of success,” he
states, “but these weaknesses can
be worked out by the Executive
Committee.”

Already, Jay Passavant, president
of the Student Body, has appointed
two commmittees to study the
Honor System. One committee will
review the jurisdictional limits of
the System, studying and evaluat-
ing existing policies affecting such
matters as off-campus and out-of-
University offenses — where the
applicability of the Honor System
is now in question.

A second committee is especially

 

 

 

designed to evaluate procedures of
the System. Its members include
Intermediate Law Representative
Pete Hendricks, University Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley, As-
sistant Professor of Law Andrew W.
McThenia, and Mr. Passavant.

Reports from these committees
have not yet been filed. However,
the two groups are going over all
problems of the Honor System
from every aspect. For example,
amendments to the Student Body
consitution which would guarantee
due process for the accused in
honor cases were proposed to the
Executive Committee by myself,
but now have been referred to the
study committees for consideration.

The Honor System is coming
under its closest scrutiny in history.
Although changes are bound to
come out of the studies now under
way, they certainly will not weaken
the System or cause it to become
extinct. On the contrary, these
changes will be made only with
the intentions of strengthening it.
The Honor System, already fully
established by _ tradition, must
change with a changing Student
Body or be left behind to stagnate
in its own weaknesses.

FooTBALL ACHES AND PAINS s What may have been the most successful non-successful football season
in recent years has just been completed.
The Generals, who could tie just one game in their first five outings
(and that a o-o Homecoming deadlock against Hampden-Sydney), came
roaring back to take three of their last four games.
Responsible for the early-season sluggishness was a bundle of maladies
you wouldn’t wish on your mother-in-law. Such as...

Halfback Luke Crosland—Suffered torn knee ligaments in the Guilford
game, the opener, and later underwent surgery. Out for the year.

Linebacker John Wolf—Aggrevated old knee injury in Guilford con-
test, same knee that required an operation last winter. Played
later on, but not up to par.

Defensive back Don Sharpe—Pulled out of the Randolph-Macon game
with, you guessed it, a knee injury. Sat out a few games, played
sporadically later.

Defensive back Lee Graham—Pulled out of the Randolph-Macon en-
counter with, oh no, a knee injury that forced him to miss several
succeeding games. Came back later, but not with same efficiency.

Linebacker Drew Kumpuris—Had his chest slightly caved in during
Macon game, missed the next one with Centre. Recovered to do
a fine job.

Defensive end Scott Mackenzie—Had to carried off the field after fifth
play against Lafayette, and he never saw another minute of action.
It was his knee!

Offensive tackle Tom Mullenix—Broke his hand at mid-season. He
watched next games from the sidelines in street clothes.

Defensive back Jay Dorman—Just about the saddest story going. He
strained his knee in a scrimmage before the start of the 1967
season, preventing him from playing at all. The injury never

came around, and Jay, although dressing, failed to make it into

any game this year, either.

Then there was the schedule, something head coach Buck Leslie
termed “the toughest opposition we’ve had since I came here.” It was
particularly mean right at the outset, a time when W&L could ill afford

such bad luck.

For in addition to the injuries, the Generals had to assimilate quickly
to a new coach. Sometimes, it can be pulled off, often not. But Leslie’s
leadership and determined spirit paid off later on, as W&L regrouped

and started winning.

JANUARY 1969

 

s What once had been termed a
season of question all of a sudden
has become a year of plenty for the
University’s hard-charging basket-
ball team.

The Generals, after an_ initial
opening-game 78-71 home court set-
back to Randolph-Macon, then
won eight straight to sail into the
Christmas holiday break with their
best record at that time since Verne
Canfield has been head coach.

The last two victories came in
the first Washington and Lee In-
vitational Tournament on Dec.
19-20, an 89-65 first-round win over
Shepherd and an 87-75 champion-
ship game victory over Blooms-
burg State (Pa.).

The tourney crown capped an
outstanding first half-season of
play, proving W&L has overcome
the problems it faced before the
campaign started. The No. 1 issue
at that point was the absence of
starting forward Mal Wesselink, a
6-6 outside shooter, believe it or
not, who transferred to the Uni-
versity of Maryland.

Issue No. 2 was the absence of
starting guard John Carrere, who
opted not to play this winter.

Issue No. 3 was the absence of
team captain Rob Bauer, whose
chronic knee injury finally forced
him to abandon the sport. An All-
State performer as a freshman three
years ago, Bauer underwent surgery
to relieve the trouble, but the knee

never came back to playing condi-
tion,

The Generals had plenty of
talent left, though. Junior forward
Mel Cartwright and junior center
Mike Neer immediately took
charge—Cartwright faking and driv-
ing the baseline for points under-
neath, and Neer grabbing a re-
bound and putting it back up and
in.

They do it with such ease. The
6-5 Cartwright owns a patent on
his now-famous one-on-one moves,
to the exent he was averaging 21.4
points (hitting 59.5 per cent of his
floor shots) at the break. He sank
his 1,oooth career point in the
Lynchburg game on Dec. 10.

Neer, the tall and rangy 6-7 pivot
man, is a perfect complement to
Cartwright. When he jumps, he
goes out of sight, and when he
shoots, he has to aim downward.
He is the ideal argument for the
12-foot basket.

To date, Neer is averaging 17.1
a game, hitting on 53.5 per cent of
his field attempts.

Those two guys now make it easy
to believe W&L is in line for its
third conference championship in
a row, then, possibly, a berth in
the NCAA regional playoffs. But
the Generals have some tough
opposition still to come, including
that big game with Navy, so they’re
not home free yet.

W. Ross McCain is one of Hartford's
(Conn.) leading citizens. Mr. McCain, an
Arkansas-born lawyer, worked his way up
to president in one of America’s leading
firms, the Aetna Insurance Co. He moved
to Hartford in 1919, and is leaving his
mark on the community in many areas—
business, civic, and social. McCain, who
retired as Aetna’s president in 1950,
still has one foot in the business world—
he is a voting trustee of the Mechanics
Savings Bank, and is an honorary director
of the Connecticut Bank and Trust Com-
pany and the Connecticut Mutual In-
surance Company. Until recent'y, he
played golf two or three times a week
at the Hartford Golf Club. Following
graduation in 1898, McCain went
abroad for the next two years, studying
and traveling in Germany and France.
Upon his return to Arkansas, he began
preparing for a career in law. Although
he was admitted to the bar in 1903, he
never practiced that profession. He was
a state agent in Arkansas for Aetna In-
surance Co. from 1911 to 1919, when he
was called to the home office in Hart-
furd. There, he worked his way through
the ranks and was named president in
1933. Recently the Hartford Courant ran
an article about McCain—the commun-

ity leader.

A tribute on the occasion of the goth
anniversary of the Mental Hospital In-
stitutes of the American Psychiatric As-
sociation was made to Dr. DANIEL BLAIN,
Dr. Blain, the first medical director of
the Association, created and convened the
first Mental Hospital Institute in April,
1949. The Association provides a forum
in which those who work in mental hos-
pitals can express their needs publicly,
exchange and enhance their knowledge,
and strengthen their will to cope with
their problems. Dr. Blain also initiated
the APA Mental Hospital Service and its
journal for sharing psychiatric informa-
tion. As commissioner of mental hygiene
in California and now as superintendent
of the Philadelphia State Hospital, Dr.
Blain continues his tireless efforts in be-
half of the mentally handicapped. At the
