A GREEN THUMB
IN A
‘VAST WASTELAND’

Washington and Lee Works
With the Alfred I. duPont
Awards Foundation

To Encourage

Better Broadcasting

Mrs. JessIE BALL DUPONT,

founder of the Alfred I.

duPont Awards Foundation,

and Dr. FRANcIs P. GAINES,

who served as chairman of

the Awards Committee for 17
years.

O ONE BLAMES Washington and
Lee University for what
seems to be wrong in television and
radio, but relatively few persons
are aware that the University does
play a substantial role in encourag-
ing some of the things that are
good in broadcasting.

As the administrative education-
al institution for the annual Alfred
I. duPont Awards in radio and tele-
vision, Washington and Lee each
year assists the Alfred I. duPont
Awards Foundation in honoring
the best broadcasting in the public
interest that this nation has to of-
fer.

The awards presentation which
took place in Washington late in
March marked the goth time that
the duPont Awards have singled
out radio and television stations
and commentators for unusual and
distinguished public service. The
awards were established in 1942 by
Mrs. Jessie Ball duPont, a trustee
of the University and one of its
greatest benefactresses. They honor
the memory of her late husband,
Alfred I. duPont, and seek to per-
petuate his profound interest in
science and industry and his great
devotion to the welfare of the na-
tion and humanity.

Winners of 1961 duPont
Awards pose with PRESIDENT
CoLE and HuGH CARLETON
GREENE, director-general of
ihe British Broadcasting Cor-
poration. L-R, PRESIDENT
CoLeE, MARTIN AGRONSKY of
NBC, commentator winner;
Mr. GREENE; STIMSON BUL-
Litt, of KING-TYV, Seattle,
large station winner; and
‘TREvoR THomas, of KPFK,
small station winner.

ies the annual call for nominations
tells why the broadcasting industry
was selected for the awards:

“... because of the enlarging in-
fluence exercised by this industry
upon American life and thought,
not merely through its manifold
services in entertainment and _ in-
struction, but more significantly in
the field of public education, to
which it contributes the deeper
spiritual consequences of strength-
ened morale, integrity of attitude,
and fidelity to ideals.”

The duPont Awards are different
from other awards offered in radio
and television. ‘They do not recog-
nize single programs, or single per-
formances, nor are they concerned
with viewer or listener ratings. The
sole criterion for judging potential
duPont winners is, ““How well has
this station or this commentator
served the public interest this
year?’

‘The manner in which the awards
are conferred is different, too, quite
unlike the extravagant productions
which often accompany the bestow-
al of TV “Emmy” awards and the
like. After the winners are an-
nounced in the national and broad-
casting press, a small, dignified din-
ner is held in Washington, attend-
ed only by the winners, officials of
the foundation, and a select repre-
sentation of leaders in the indus-
try—men like Newton N. Minow,

SPRING 1962

chairman of the Federal Communi-
cations Commission, and Governor
LeRoy Collins, the former Florida
chief executive who now heads the
National Association of Broadcast-
ers.

There are only three duPont
Awards given each year. One hon-
ors a relatively large radio or tele-
vision station, one honors a rela-
tively small station, and one hon-
ors a commentator. When the
awards were started, only one sta-
tion and the commentator were
cited, but the foundation has made
appropriate changes to keep up
with developments within the in-
dustry and to recognize the differ-
ence in resources available to sta-
tions of different sizes. Originally
established for radio, the awards
competition was expanded in 1949
to recognize television, and the gen-
eral purpose of the foundation is
phrased in such a way as to ac-
commodate recognition of any fu-
ture technical developments that
may affect broadcasting.

In 1951, the Foundation acknow-
ledged the urgent need for future
leadership in broadcasting, and in
a rededication of its purposes, it
chose to encourage education for
careers in broadcasting and the al-
lied sciences. Henceforth, winners
would be invited to apply the
$1,000 stipend, which accompanies
a duPont Award, to a scholarship

 

or fellowship for a deserving young
man or woman eager to enter the

broadcasting field. Since then,
thirty such scholarships have been
established by duPont winners,
and the Foundation itself now gives
$5,000 annually to each of four col-
leges, one of them Washington and
Lee, to promote scholarships for
students in the communications
arts and sciences.

When the Foundation announc-
ed its interest in education, Wash-
ington and Lee was chosen as the
impartial institution which would
supervise the administration of the
annual awards competition. Dr.
Francis P. Gaines, then president
of the University and now its chan-
cellor, had served as chairman of
the awards committee since its be-
ginning in 1942, so it was appropri-
ate that Washington and Lee as-
sume this distinguished assignment.

Professor O. W. Riegel, director
of the Lee Memorial Journalism
Foundation and head of the Uni-
versity Department of Journalism
and Communications, became cu-
rator of the awards and continues
in that capacity today. It is his job
to accumulate the entries each year
for judging in Lexington by a pan-
el of five members, the chairman of
which is the President of Washing-
ton and Lee. Since Dr. Gaines’ re-
tirement in 1959, President Fred
C. Cole has served in this capacity.

ination: left to right. "TURNER CATLEDGE, foundation curator O. W. RIEGEL, LAWRENCE LAURENT, and CLIFFORD Durr. At right, Mr. LAvu-
RENT studies a brochure submitted as part of the entry of one station.

From the start, the Florida Na-
tional Bank of Jacksonville, Flori-
da, has acted as Trustee for the
awards foundation. Mr. William
H. Goodman acted as secretary of
the Foundation for many years, a
job now capably filled by Mr. Ken-
neth E. Haefele of Jacksonville.

Nominations, in the form of bro-
chures, kinescopes, tape recordings,
and photographs, come from all
over the United States. While the
number of stations that nominate
themselves is relatively small com-
pared with the total number of ra-
dio and television stations in the
country, 126 stations sent in nom-
inations for the 1961 awards, and
the number of nominations has
taken a sharp up-turn.

Professor Riegel isn’t surprised
at the relatively low percentage of
station nominations in a strictly
quantitative sense. He believes that
while virtually every station would
like to win a duPont Award, the
quality of performance of past

4

award winners, and the criteria of
general excellence in program pol-
icy and performance rather than
recognition of individual programs,
result in many stations’ disqualify-
ing themselves as doing only aver-
age or routine jobs. He feels that
all stations genuinely meriting con-
sideration are in fact considered.

As a double check this year, a
“spotting’’ system was employed by
Professor Riegel for the first time.
It involved some _ twenty-eight
“monitors” across the nation,
knowledgeable persons who were
invited to submit their own nomin-
ations or asked to check on the sta-
tions which nominated themselves.
Professor Riegel wasn’t too. sur-
prised when the reports of the spot-
ters paralleled the nominations al-
ready in hand.

Once the entries are in, the judg-
es assemble in Lexington for a
day’s exhaustive poring over the
voluminous presentations, listen-
ing to tapes, and watching kine-

 

scope recordings. And the judges
devote much time to pointed dis-
cussions about the merits of the
various entries.

Besides President Cole, the 1961
judges included Turner Catledge,
managing editor of the New York
Times and a veteran duPont ap-
praiser; Clifford J. Durr, a former
member of the Federal Communi-
cations Commission; Lawrence
Laurent, television and radio edi-
tor of the Washington Post and
Times-Herald; and Dr. Gaines, act-
ing in behalf of Mrs. duPont, who
until this year served as a regular
member of the panel.

When. the judging was complet-
ed, three new winners had been se-
lected for 1961. They were large
station KING-TV_ of Seattle,
Wash.; small station KPFK, a non-
commercial FM radio station in
Los Angeles; and commentator
Martin Agronsky, a Washington
correspondent of the National
Broadcasting Company.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

KING-TV’s selection was based
on, among other things, ‘‘a consis-
tent policy of responsibility toward
community needs and interests, for
initiative in preparing programs re-
flecting thoughtful awareness of the
public interest and its own role
in community life... .”

Although the merits of a station’s

  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
    
    

KPFK’s facilities in Los An-
geles are small but excellent.
Station manager LARRY
STEINBERG delivers a weekly
“Report to the Listener” on
the progress of the non-com-
mercial FM station.

SPRING 1962

work during the awards year is the
primary consideration, the judges
also. considered something of

KING-TV’s history. Long before
the coaxial cables and microwave
relay stations brought virtually all
the nation’s TV stations into vast
network complexes, KING-TV had
existed practically isolated on the

Northwest coast, filling its program
hours with locally-produced materi-
al. ‘The station learned how to
make its local programming highly
acceptable to the public, and when
the network did come to Seattle,
KING-T'V did not relinquish its re-
sponsibility to continue serving the
public interests of its listeners.

Part of KING-TV’s winning
entry was an hour-long pro-
gram which investigated the
background of a double slay-
ing in Seattle. Told mostly
in the words of the convicted
killer himself, the story of
“A Volcano Named White”
took KING-TV’s production
staff into the man’s cell for
film and recordings.

5

As a result, today many hours of
“prime time” are devoted to local
programs of great community-wide
interest, while the westerns, situa-
tion comedies, and detective stories
are delayed or not broadcast at all.
Perhaps the most intriguing of
KING-TV’s efforts in 1961 was an
hour-long documentary  explora-
tion into a convicted killer’s mind,
seeking the answer to why this man
had killed two Seattle citizens in a
single evening of violence. Told al-
most entirely in the words of the
convicted man himself, the pro-
gram provided an unusual insight
to some of the shortcomings of cur-
rent approaches to social problems.

‘The small station winner was the
first non-commercial station ever
to win a duPont Award. KPFK is
one of three small, non-commercial
stations operated by the Pacifica
Foundation. It and its sister sta-
tions in San Francisco and New
York draw their financial resources
almost entirely from subscriptions
of listeners. :

KPFK’s bill of fare is set forth
in a weekly “folio” mailed to its
subscribers, and it includes a rich
offering of music, drama, _ litera-
ture, language study, and commen-
tary on controversial public affairs
subjects.

The station states its policy in
these terms:

“The whole province of creativ-
ity, whether it be in music, litera-
ture, drama, children’s programs,
or in public affairs, is cultivated by
KPFK, yet in practice programs
tend—particularly in contrast to
conventional mass communica-
tions—to be what is rarely or never
heard elsewhere. Subscribers expect
their news broadcasts to give more
than headlines and to develop stor-
ies with a civil-liberties, civil-rights,
foreign-policy point of view in the
spaces that would be advertising
or human interest stories on com-
mercial radio.

“Listeners learn that the nightly
commentators treat these and many

more problems in accordance with
their specializations and points of
view—which run the gamut of the
political, economic, religious, and
philosophical convictions of our
time. Not all viewpoints are pre-
sented in the course of one week
or month. Commentators are se-
lected for their ability to present
a point of view, and not because
there is a vacancy in points of view
to be covered. Particular points of
view wait for able men who have
time and the inclination to prepare
programs.”

KPFK uses some of its limited
funds to purchase programs from
the British Broadcasting Corpora-
tion, the English-licensed network
that is entirely non-commercial and
devoted to serving the public in-
terest.

In g0 years of duPont Awards,
at has been the general practice to
permit the recipient of the com-
mentator award to expand some-

m HUGH CARLETON GREENE, as direct-
or-general of the British Broad-
casting Corporation, is one of the
world’s leading proponents of pub-
lic service broadcasting. The op-
eration of the BBC is based en-
tirely on serving the interests of
the British public, at home and
overseas, and it receives no income
from advertising. At times Mr.
Greene has gone on record to the
effect that commercial interests in
broadcasting are incompatible with
public service interests. His posi-
tion as a leader in world broad-
casting and the provocative nature
of some of his views in regard to
broadcasting responsibility made
him a singularly interesting choice
as the first major speaker ever to
address ..the Alfred -1I....duPont
Awards dinner.

Here are some excerpts from his
speech which drew varied reactions
from American broadcasters:

“IT think it is worth while taking
a good hard look at some of these
loaded words, “‘freedom,” ‘‘democ-
racy, “competition” as they apply
in broadcasting. What do people
who speak about “freedom” in
broadcasting really mean? So far as
I can make out they usually mean
freedom from Government control.
We are, of course, all against Gov-
ernment control—as we are all, no
doubt, against sin. We are all will-
ing to go on the barricades to de-
fend broadcasting against that in-
iquity. But who are these rather
curious allies who stand with us on
the barricades beating off the gov-
ernment forces in the name of free-
dom? I am rather afraid that they
are preparing to stab us in the
back. What is, in fact, their inter-
est in freedom? Don’t they want to
control broadcasting for economic
ends—for selfish ends—just as in-
tensely as any government? And
why should broadcasters regard
bondage to economic interests as

A British
Viewpoint

“freedom” and bondage to state in-
terests as “slavery?” Both condi-
tions are bondage. And, if we are
to serve the public which I would
declare to be our main responsibil-
ity, we cannot be both bond and
free.

pursuit of the truth in the news. He
said the complexity of the task
would seldom permit complete suc-

a nationwide news magazine. After
the trial, Agronsky traveled
throughout West Germany, seeking
the reactions there to Eichmann’s
conviction.

Agronsky is remembered by many
television viewers for his Washing-
ton interviews on the Dave Garro-
way and John Chancellor ‘““Today’”’
shows. Regarded as an especially
skillful interviewer, Agronsky was
one of few newsmen ever granted a

interpretation of news, over many
years and often in the face of ob-
stacles and at personal sacrifice, and
especially for the competence and
stamina of his coverage of the en-
tire Eichmann trial during 1961,

hanced the respect in which he is

correspondents who were at the
Kichmann trial in Israel for its en-
tire duration. The effect of such a

For its goth anniversary the
duPont Foundation made several
significant changes in the general
format of the awards dinner. For
the first time, the program included
a major address, a feature that
probably will be continued.

The principal speaker was
Hugh Carleton Greene, director-
general of the British Broadcasting
Corporation, and a leading spokes-
man in behalf of public service

 

broadcasting. His address was gen-
erally critical of American broad-
casting (see Page 7); not everyone
present agreed with what he said,
and the reaction in some areas of
the broadcasting industry press was
sharply critical of his viewpoints.

Another feature new to the
duPont dinner was the presence
of the wives of the guests. Hereto-
fore, the only ladies present at the
dinners were Mrs. duPont, occas-
ionally a lady who served as a
judge, and occasionally a lady rep-
resenting the management of a win-
ning station or in the case of NBC
commentator Pauline Frederick, a
winner herself.

For two years now, Mrs. duPont’s
health has prevented her from at-
tending the dinner, held tradition-
ally in the Mayflower Hotel. On
both occasions she has asked Dr.
Gaines to act as her personal rep-
resentative and to greet her many
friends in broadcasting. And on
both occasions, the dinner guests
have responded with a telegram to
Mrs. duPont, expressing their re-
gret that she could not be there.

Throughout the broacasting in-
dustry, the duPont Awards possess
great prestige, and President Cole
and Professor Riegel agree that
they will continue to grow in sta-
ture and importance. Under FCC
Chairman Minow’s direction, the
FCC is attempting to renew broad-
casters’ awareness that they have a
public trust to fulfill, and, accord-
ing to Minow, if they don’t meas-
ure up, they must show why their
licenses should not be denied when
they come up for renewal.

It was Mr. Minow who labeled
some areas of broadcasting activity
as a ‘vast wasteland.” In a small
but significant way, through its ad-
ministration of the Alfred I. du-
Pont Awards for Radio and Tele-
vision, Washington and Lee _ is
helping to bring a little green
freshness to that vast wasteland.
There is some indication that the
University has a green thumb.

things to it, it can talk back to
you in English. In other ways, too.
It plays baseball, could probably
learn to play football and other
sports, and there’s a little bit of
the riverboat gambler in it. It deals
a mean game of blackjack, and it
does a pretty good job of simulat-
ing a one-armed bandit.

It also does 4,000 arithmetical
computations a second, analyzes
250 IBM cards a minute, juggles
the information it reads about in

any conceivable fashion, and then
punches out the facts you need on
IBM cards at the rate of 125 cards
a minute. It’s not infallible, it can
make a mistake, but if it does, it
usually knows before you do, and it
will tell you about it.

In one way it is 100 per cent per-

 

fect. If you make a mistake in deal-
ing with it, it will either just sit
there and hum at you, or it will
chatter rather indignantly on its
typewriter that you are wrong and
perhaps what to do about it.

IT is a 1620 IBM Data Process-
ing machine—a computer. It’s small,
neat, compact, transistorized, clean-
cut, efficient, and perhaps a little
alien to the humanities professor
who may be a brilliant scholar of

9

Ming Dynasty objects of art but
who still counts on his fingers.

For the professors and others
who've gotten to know the 1620,
understand what it can do, and ap-
ply the results of its work, the ma-
chine is a new-found friend, a col-
league for teaching and research,
and a valuable addition to the re-
sources of the University.

The computer was installed in
mid-January, occupying a_ large
room that once was the student
dining hall—the old ‘“Beanery’’—
behind Washington and Robinson
Halls. ‘The room is designed to be
used as a work and project area as
well as a classroom for students
studying the techniques and
theories of advanced statistics.

Washington and Lee is the first
Virginia college to possess a 1620.
President Fred C. Cole, who helped
introduce computers to the Tulane
campus when he was academic vice-
president there in 1958, is enthus-
lastic about the role the Uni-
iversity’s new machine can play in
undergraduate instruction and stu-
dent and faculty research. He

10

talked to students about the com-
puter in this way before the Janu-
ary 19 Founders Day assembly:

“Computers and the miracles of
automation, mathematics, science,
and technology which they permit
are a part of our world today and
a growing influence for the future.
You will have an opportunity to
have an introduction to what these
machines can do, and cannot do,
and thus you will be able to better
understand the ways in which they
might affect your life when you as-
sume your places in business, in-
dustry, teaching, or whatever.”

As soon as the computer was in-
stalled, a two-week class was held
for interested faculty and staff
members to acquaint them with the
machine and some basic “‘program-
ming” techniques. The computer—
any computer—can do nothing un-
less it has a precise set of instruc-
tions or “program” as to what data
is to be processed and what result
is to be sought from this processing.

‘Two weeks isn’t a long time to
grasp the fundamentals of a com-

 

Professors listen while IBM teacher explains intricacies of computer programs.

puter and the theory of its opera-
tion, but to the credit of Dr. Rob-
ert Smith of IBM who conducted
the class, his pupils gave it a try.
They found out about “basic ma-
chine language,” really the only
language the computer under-
stands, and they found out about
the other languages—Fortran, Got-
ran, SPS—that make it possible for
many—not all—reasonably intelli-
gent persons to write programs in
a simplified style that the machine
can translate into its basic machine
language.

Simplified doesn’t necessarily
mean that Fortran is simple, but
it’s a piece of cake compared to the
multi-digited numerical instruc-
tions upon which all machine op-
crations are based.

After three months of working
with the 1620, about a half dozen
professors and staff members have
become quite proficient in Fortran,
and a class of go students in Ad-
vanced Statistics are learning how
to program for the 1620 as a part of
their laboratory work.

Several professors have jumped

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

right in with both feet, so to speak,
making the computer a partner in
their research projects and_ class-
room teaching. Dr. Edward F.
Turner, head of the physics depart-
ment, has set up a program that
enables him to compute swiftly
and accurately the standard devia-
tion in his students’ grades, and he
has helped his students check the
accuracy of results of their labora-
tory experiments on the computer.
When certain tentative changes in
the curriculum were suggested, Dr.
‘Turner was able to make the com-
puter analyze both the suggested
curriculum and the one in current
use to determine the relative pros-
pects of student success or failure
under each.

Chemistry professor Dr. John
H. Wise uses the computer in his
study of “converting observed wave
lengths in the spectrum of rare
earth elements to a measurement
of the energy of light.” Results will
yield important information on
atomic structure. Dr. Wise points
out that the 1620 finds answers for
him in six seconds that it would
have taken an afternoon to de-
termine by hand calculation.

Dr. Leonard Jarrard, an assist-
ant professor in the psychology de-

partment, uses the 1620 for two of
his pet projects. Dr. Jarrard has
had considerable experience at
Carnegie Tech in computer work,
and he is currently collaborating
with a professor there in a study
which deals with “concept forma-
tion” and “symbolic reasoning,”
all related to the possibility of get-
ting computers to really “think.”

Dr. Jarrard also is experiment-
ing with the effects of radiation
on behavior patterns in white rats,
and the 1620 is helpful to him in
analyzing the results of his on-
campus research.

Some half-dozen student _ par-
ticipants in the University’s Rob-
ert E. Lee Research Program for
undergraduates have been  ac-
quainted with machine techniques,
so that they can take programmed
data from Dr. Wise or Dr. Jarrard,
punch it onto IBM cards, feed it
into the machine and make the
1620 do the work. Because they
help both professors accumulate
the data upon which the machine
calculates, the computer work of
the students is a logical and help-
ful extension of their experience
as research assistants.

The 1620 is considered a part of
the University Statistical Records

Office which is under the supervi-
sion of J. Baine Fox. Much of what
the computer does becomes mater-
ially useful only when some other
machines in Mr. Fox’s battery get
a chance to process the informa-
tion. Like many others, Fox is
enthusiastic about ways the com-
puter and his other machines can
benefit Washington and Lee.

Information contained in the oc-
cupational questionnaires returned
by alumni is being coded on IBM
cards. The computer will be able
to read these cards at its standard
rate of 250 per minute, compile
any combination of alumni in-
formation contained on the cards,
and produce a new “deck” which
will contain only the information
desired.

Fox and professors in the mathe-
matics department are devising a
program which will be helpful in
“sectioning” students for classes, a
job heretofore handled by a huge
faculty committee at a great cost
of time and temperament. If they
are successful, and other schools
have managed to do this, it will
be a big step forward in registra-
tion and class assignment pro-
cedures.

The appetite of the 1620 for data
is voracious. It takes it only three
seconds to square 100 numbers and
add the squares. A single arithmet-
ical computation takes only 80/-
1,000,000 of a second. Much of the
time the 1620 just sits there hum-
ming, waiting for its relatively
grossly inefficient operators to make
the next move. The slowest thing
it does is type out information or
“output” on its typewriter, and
even then it goes faster that the
fastest stenographer could.

For demonstration purposes and
occasional amusement, IBM pro-
gram experts have devised tricks
for the 1620 to perform. It can play
blackjack with you, follow all the
rules that a Las Vegas dealer must,
and wind up, probably, the winner.
At any rate, it will tell you how

1l

much you won or lost whenever
you indicate you’ve had enough. It
also can be turned into a slot ma-
chine, with typewriter characters
substituted for the bells, plums,
and cherries of the familiar one-
armed bandits, and again it takes
the role of the “house” and keeps
score of the play.

Its most fascinating and swiftly-
paced trick is a baseball game in
which you get to pick the most
fabulous all-star team in history for
your side. From a roster of go base-
ball “greats” you select your team,
then the machine picks its squad
at random from the 80 that are
left, and the game begins. Based
on a random selection factor which

is different for every game, a full
nine-inning game (extra innings if
necessary) takes place before your
very eyes. You see the typewriter
rattle off the results much as you
watch the progress of a world ser-
ies game via teletype.

Because the players are predom-
inantly great hitters, like Ruth,
Gehrig, Cobb, Ott, and DiMaggio,
the games are usually high scor-
ing, for the computer takes into
account their batting average in
their best year in the major leagues.
But occasionally the pitcher gets
in his licks, too. Like the recent
game in which the 1620's Lefty
Grove over a_two-inning span

struck out Dimaggio, Ruth, Gehrig,

Traynor, and Hornsby in order,
and then forced Mel Ott to pop-up
to the pitcher.

Dr. James W. Sweeney, director
of ‘Tulane’s two giant computer
centers, visited Washington and
Lee in February to discuss with ad-
ministrators and professors the po-
tential of the new 1620. Dr. Sween-
ey, who is on intimate terms with
all kinds of computers, spoke of
the 1620 as “old Betsy there,” and
the things he said were generally
reassuring to most who heard him.
He talked about many of the new
uses being devised for computer
techniques, including rapid ad-
vances in “information retrieval.”

Dr. Sweeney predicted that the
day would come when articles and
books on virtually every subject
would be coded and stored in com-
puters’ memories, ready for instant
recall on the basis of “key’’ words
in their titles. He said the savings
in time and effort on the part of
scholarly researchers would be tre-
mendous. ‘To which Dr. William
W. Pusey III, Dean of the College,
made a reply which perhaps spoke
for many not quite ready to be ov-
erwhelmed by computers and other
forms of automation.

“But,” said Dean Pusey in a
plaintive voice, “I like to thumb
through books.”

w THE LATE Dr. Earl LeVerne
Crum, former professor of ancient
languages at Washington and Lee,
was eulogized in a recent issue of
the University of Heidelberg’s Ru-
perto-Carola, a publication for
former students of the famous Ger-
man university. Dr. Crum, as an of-
ficer in the American military gov-
ernment organization, helped re-
open Heidelberg upon the close of
hostilities in Europe in 1945. The
good will which he engendered

among his German colleagues is
reflected in this exerpt from the
Heidelberg publication:

“He would not have been suc-
cessful if he had not been a man
who sought out human qualities
even while in office and in the com-
plex of official regulations. When
he had assured himself that his
German partners in Heidelberg
harbored no dark plans, he took
confidence and became our friend;
he became one of us. He didn’t give
his friendship easily, but once he
had given it, he was the most faith-
ful of friends. No suspicion, no po-
litical friction could cause him to
sever friendship. Stern manliness
and tender feelings were coupled in
him. His eyes often said more than
his scant words. After his return to
America he often offered the hospi-
tality of his home to his Heidelberg
colleagues.

“Our University invited him in
1949 to return as a visiting profes-
sor and made him an Honorary
Senator. It will gratefully preserve
the memory of this man who was
so helpful to us in a difficult hour.
His Heidelberg friends will always
praise their good fortune in having
known this unaffected and_ loyal
human being.”

Company Fund, the project will
strengthen and preserve the Chapel
as nearly as possible as it was when
General Lee was president of
Washington College. Certain mod-
ern improvements, such as_ fire-
proofing and air-conditioning, will

not detract from the mid-1gth Cen-
tury charm of the Chapel.

A complete catalogue of all the
contents of the Chapel was com-
pleted last summer. Restoration
experts studied the building, their
recommendations were given to
the University’s architects, and
specifications are now complete.

Contractor for the restoration is
the John P. Pettyjohn Company of
Lynchburg, also contractor on the
University’s new science building.

m THE BIG ISSUE this Spring between
students and the faculty-adminis-
tration was the problem of conflicts
between University-sponsored danc-
es—Openings, Fancy Dress, etc.—
and the “combo parties’ within
fraternities which were scheduled
at the same time.

Attendance at University dances,
particularly after any intermission
break, had fallen off to the point
where good, expensive orchestras
like Duke Ellington and Warren
Covington were playing largely for
the faculty chaperones and a hand-
ful of students and dates. Also,
many students, through the annual
Dance Plan, had already invested
in “season tickets’ for the Univer-
sity dances, and the expense of the
combo parties was in effect a double
outlay for those students. Univer-

17

Singer Mrc WELLES and
her musicians hold the
spotlight at the Spring
Concert in Doremus Gym-
nasium. Other featured
performers were LEON
Brep and DAVE GUARD.

sity officials felt that this unusual
financial imposition on some stu-
dents and the dwindling attendance
at the dances—which the students
say they want to retain—was reason
to ask the Interfraternity Council
to seek some solution.

When the IFC failed to come up
with any plan that the faculty com-
mittee on fraternities and the so-
cial functions committee felt would
work, the fraternity committee
ruled that combo parties no long-
er could be scheduled during the
same hours as University student
social functions.

Many students reacted strongly to
the action, charging through Ring-
tum Phi editorials, columns, and
letters to the editor that the fac-
ulty move was a blatant transgres-
sion against “inherent’’ student
rights, a demonstrated lack of faith
in the students’ ability to govern
their own affairs, and a unilateral
action that refused to give IFC
proposals a chance to succeed or
fail.

Some students recognized the
University point of view: that stu-
dent freedom involves student re-
sponsibility, that student freedom
and student government are tra-
ditional at Washington and Lee
but that neither is an inherent
right of students, and that student
failure to fulfill certain responsi-
bilities of self-administration is
sufficient justification for the facul-

18

ty to act in the breach when the cir-
cumstances require.

m# EVEN BEFORE THE combo-dance is-
sue was drawn, both students and
faculty were pleased with the suc-
cess of the Spring weekend. Instead
of the usual dances, two evening
concerts were held in Doremus
Gymnasium with the musical em-
phasis on the currently popular
“folk” singers.

Leon Bibb and Meg Welles were
featured at the Friday night con-
cert, while Dave Guard and _ his
Whiskeyhill Singers were the at-
traction on Saturday evening. Both
concerts were well attended, and
on their own initiative students did
not schedule their combo parties
until after the concerts were over.

HIGHLIGHT OF THE SPRING sports
season was the visit of a touring
Australian lacrosse team to Wash-
ington and Lee for the Generals’
first game of the year. In a way, the
Aussies were returning a call, for
a combined Washington and Lee-
University of Virginia team had vis-
ited “down under’ two years ago.

During their three-day stay in
Lexington, the visitors were the
guests of the University, had an op-
portunity to visit with students in
fraternity houses, toured Natural
Bridge and other nearby attrac-
tions, and then wound up by de-
feating the Generals in a mud-
bath contest, 10-8. After the game,
both teams were honored at a ban-
quet given by the Robert E. Lee
Episcopal Church, where _ the

speeches were many and the mut-_

ual admiration great.

The all-star Australians, most of
them college graduates who play
for “club” teams back home, pre-
sented the Washington and Lee
players with pennant souvenirs of
the game, and Bob Coldstream,
president of the Australian La-
crosse Association, presented Gen-
eral Coach Bob McHenry with a
genuine boomerang for the Univer-
sity’s trophy case.

m IN ANOTHER MUD-BATH climaxing
“spring”’ football practice, the 1962
varsity squad built up a 14-0 lead
over a team composed mostly of
seniors off the unbeaten 1961
squad. Then, in the final four min-
utes, the “alumni” team struck
back on the good work of Steve

SPRING 1962

Suttle and Robin Wood to even
the score and just miss a win when
Wood’s sneak for the extra point
failed by inches.

SPRING SPORTS SUCCESS this year
has been an almost complete rever-
sal of the pattern in 1961, one of
the best in recent school annals.
This year, only the track team is
winning with regularity, and even
it had a 16-meet win streak broken
in the first contest of the year. It’s
record now is 4-1, the lone defeat
inflicted by Wake Forest.

With the exception of one pitch-
er, the baseball team is made up of
the same boys who had an 8-4 sea-
son last year, but the absence of
that pitcher, Roy Carpenter, has
brought Coach Joe Lyles his troub-
les. To date, the Generals have
won only once, dropped ten games,
and down the line it has been the

lack of consistent mound work that
made the difference.

Lacrosse is in a rebuilding stage
under Coach McHenry, and _ the
play has improved steadily as the
season progressed. After eight los-
ses, the stickmen took it out on
North Carolina, 9-4, but may have
to settle for a one-victory campaign.
Coming up are Baltimore and Vir-
ginia, two tough ones.

Coach Cy Twombly says he has
“too many seniors” to have a good
golf team this year. As a result, the
General linksmen are only 2-3 for
the season with three matches to
go. One senior who has lived up to
expectations is Jack Vardaman, the
Generals’ No. 1 and one of the best
in Virginia.

A young tennis team with great
promise for the future is now 3-3,
although the play of No. 1 John
Baker has been inconsistent.

The Alumni Fund

The Habitual and the Regular
Donor—T here’s a Difference

HIS IS THE TIME of year when

Alumni Fund campaigns tend
to use the kind of tactics that Chris
Chenery’s jockeys employ in the
home stretch at Churchill Downs.
Alumni are cajoled, nudged, spur-
red, and whipped to come up with
that last effort that will send the
fund across the finish line, ahead
of old Siwash in dollar totals, num-
bers of contributors, average gift
per contributor, and percentage of
those solicited responding. If such
appeals fail to engender much re-
sponse, it isn’t surprising.

Thus, having mentioned the
horserace analogy and the usual
final campaign pleas, let’s take a
rather unemotional look at the
status of Washington and Lee’s
Alumni Fund, note some interest-
ing figures and share a few ran-
dom thoughts.

As of April 30, the Fund had re-
ceived $66,994 from 1,896 contribu-
tors. ‘The goals established by the
Fund Council for this year are
$100,000 and 4,000 contributors.
The dollar goal isn’t unrealistic, for
Washington and Lee alumni gave
more than this in 1956, 1957, and
1958. Perhaps the contributor goal
is a little high, for the best partici-
pation on record was the 3,378
figure for 1958.

Incidentally, 1958 was the last
year that a “full” campaign was
conducted. ‘That is, up until this

SPRING 1962

year. ‘(The University received fine
support from alumni during the
University Development Program
in the interim years. Fund-raising
experts say a big campaign like the
Development Program makes for
better annual response in_ later
years. Records elsewhere bear this
out.

This suggests a question as to just
how much habit is involved in writ-
ing the check for the annual fund.
Is there a difference between a
habitual donor and a regular don-
or? It seems that perhaps a habitual
donor might be an_ unthinking
donor whose gift is virtually auto-
matic. Of course, his dollars are no
less useful, but they aren’t quite as
meaningful as those offered by the
regular contributor who each year
ponders his own financial status,
evaluates the significance of pri-
vately-supported colleges in our so-
ciety, considers his responsibility
toward the support of private high-
er education, relates this responsi-

bility to his personal experience
and knowledge of Washington and
Lee, and then writes his check.

It seems that a big part of the
matter is identifying the habitual
givers whose habit perhaps was
broken by the Development Pro-
gram, and getting these alumni to
think in terms of supporting Wash-
ington and Lee through the Alum-
ni Fund again, but this time as
regulars.

Over in Southwest Virginia, Fer-
rum Junior College is making great
progress. Its alumni fund is starting
virtually from scratch, but the man
who directs it has a sense of hu-
mor. His mailing pieces are always
good for a chuckle. The latest de-
clared that “Statistics prove that
those who give money have money.
So, be a haver!”’

Statistics also prove there are
a lot of “havers’’ among Washing-
ton and Lee alumni. It would be
nice if they’d all become regulars,
too.

For his outstanding contribution to his
state, Herbert F. Frrzparrick was award-
ed an honorary degree of doctor of laws
by the University of West Virginia on
April 11th. The occasion marked the
inauguration of Dr. Paul Miller as pres-
ident of the University. Mr. Fitzpatrick
has been associated for many years with
the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, which
he has served as general counsel, vice-
president, chairman of the board, director,
and member of the executive committee.
In addition, he has been counsel for the
Pullman Company, the Chesapeake and
Potomac ‘Telephone Company, and_ the
Huntington Water Company, as well as
vice-president and director of many other
railway systems and major companies.
Mr. Fitzpatrick has practiced law in Hunt-
ington since 1895. He has served on the
Board of ‘Trustees of Washington and Lee
and holds an honorary LL.D. from the
University bestowed upon him in 10928.

JupGe WILLIAM HENRy BROowN drew the
first parking meter ordinance that was
ever drawn. The parking meter was in-
vented and patented by Mr. Carl Magee
of Oklahoma City. Before it was placed
on the market, Judge Brown, then a prac-
ticing attorney, became part owner and
general counsel in the business. ‘The meter
ordinance provided for a fee for parking
an automobile on the public streets, and
it was enacted into law by the city coun-
cil of Oklahoma and placed in operation
in July, 1935. Such operations being with-
out precedent, the legality was violently
attacked. Judge Brown promulgated the
theory upon which the legality of the
fee charged could be sustained and _ suc-
ceeded in securing the adoption of this
theory by the courts throughout the coun-
try.
