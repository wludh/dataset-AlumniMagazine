LTHOUGH THERE was still much
work to be done before Wash-
ington and Lee’s new science fa-
cilities could be called complete,
classes and laboratories opened as
scheduled in the new and _ re-
modeled buildings in September.
There was still the landscaping
and other outside clean-up, and
inside there were a thousand and
one odds and ends for the painters,
carpenters, plumbers, and electric-
ians. But, for the most part, stu-
dents could come and go unim-

2

paired, and the between classes traf-
fic hindered the workers little.

Completed at a cost of over
$1,500,000, the new facilities gave
a sparkling new appearance to the
University’s back campus. Although
the showpiece for inspection tours
by alumni and parents in October
was the new four-story building for
biology and physics, the complete-
ly remodeled Howe Hall for chem-
istry and geology provided the Uni-
versity, in effect, with two brand
new buildings.

Standing in relative concealment
behind the Colonnade for many
years, Howe Hall had been a toler-
able architectural incongruity.
Now, with new white pilasters ad-
ded and with appropriate white
cornices and window trim, the
building and its new companion
blend well with the University’s
traditional modified Greek revival
motif.

Inside are classrooms and labora-
tories that rank Washington and
Lee in the forefront among the na-

tion’s colleges in its provisions for
undergraduate instruction and re-
search.

Each of the four departments
boasts large lecture halls and spa-
cious laboratories where students
and professors have elbow room to
spare. Each faculty office is adjoined
by or is close to a small research
laboratory reserved for the special
work of the professor. There are
special research laboratories also
for students, particularly those en-
gaged in work under the Robert E.
Lee Research Program for under-
oraduates. In addition to classrooms
for large groups, there are smaller
seminar rooms for advanced in-
struction.

Each department has its own
library. Elevators in each building
facilitate the moving of heavy
equipment and materials from
floor to floor and save wear and tear
on professorial legs.

FALL, 1962

Lab benches and other furniture
in each department are new and
first-rate. Each has some new tech-
nical equipment, although addi-
tional equipment still must be pro-
vided before maximum good can
be made of the new facilities.

Each department has completely
new features of one kind or anoth-
er.

Physics will operate the new ob-
servatory atop the new wing of
Howe Hall where a powerful tele-
scope will be installed soon. ‘The
observatory location offers not only
an unimpaired view of the sky but
a spectacular panorama of the roll-
ing Shenandoah countryside to the
west and north of the campus.
Physics also hopes to equip a lab-
oratory for nuclear studies in the
near future. The department mus-
eum will house, among _ other
things, General Lee’s famous plane-
tarlum.

Biology will operate a new vivar-
ium and greenhouse. There is room
for projected new courses in histol-
ogy and ecology.

Chemistry has new laboratory
space for work in instrumental
analysis, as well as a new venting
system for all laboratories. Provis-
ion has been made for safer stor-
age of dangerous supplies.

Geology will make use of a new
seismology room for the study of
earthquake phenomena, and the de-
partment also has new display fa-
cilities for its extensive collection
of rocks and other minerals.

Because all departments make
use of photography in one way or
another, each has a darkroom de-
signed to meet its needs.

All rooms throughout the new
buildings are brilliantly illuminat-
ed with fluorescent lighting that
brings daylight brightness at any
hour. Restroom facilities include

A professor’s eye view of the spacious lecture room
located in the new wing of Howe Hall. A freshman
chemistry class prepares to take notes from

PROFESSOR JOHN H. WISE.

 

 

 

high pressure emergency showers
which would help reduce injury in
certain kinds of mishaps.

The science departments are gen-
erally pleased with their new ac-
commodations. A final review with
the project inspector brought out
long lists of grievances from each
department head, but most were
the kind that could and would be
corrected. All department heads
agree that, for the first time in
many years, the University is able
to offer a program in science whose
physical facilities are on a par with
the high caliber of professors and
students who are engaged in the
program.

‘The new facilities are a direct re-
sult of the two-year University De-
velopment Program which was
conducted among alumni, parents,
and other friends of the Univer-
sity from 1959 to 1961. Most of the
funds involved are the gifts of
4,135 contributors to this program.
‘The program itself was the out-
growth of the Board of Trustees’
decision to bring the University’s
science facilities into balance with
the University’s provisions for other
disciplines. The Chicago Tribune
survey in 1956, which ranked Wash-
ington and Lee among the ten best
men’s colleges in the nation, had
remarked on the relative inade-

plant.

President Fred C. Cole has em-
phasized the necessity for main-
taining a proper equilibrium
among the University’s various pro-
grams and departments. In remarks
to alumni, parents, students, and
others, he has stressed the fact that
the new facilities in science consti-
tute only one of a constant series of
adjustments in plant and program
which a forward-moving college or
university must make. In his ad-
dress to the opening University as-
sembly in September, he declared:

“If, in the past year or longer—
and continuing today—there seems
to be a new emphasis on scientific
study at Washington and Lee, this
is only an example of the constant
realignments which must take place
within a university’s broad _pro-
eram. The swift developments in

FALL, 1962

science of the past two decades de-
mand that colleges and universities
vitalize, accelerate, or otherwise ad-
just their programs of scientific in-
struction and research.

“Washington and Lee’s new sci-
ence facilities, its electronic data
processing equipment, and the ad-
dition of certain new courses re-
flect its response to this need. And
if this adjustment appears to place
other phases of the University’s
program in temporary shadow, then
strong efforts must be made to
assure that there is no real imbal-
ance in emphasis or support.

“The same standards of excel-
lence should be the goal for all di-
visions, and this striving for the
most appropriate balance among
Washington and Lee’s different
programs, departments, and many
other features must be an unending
task.”

Another Year Opens
—The 214th

ASHINGTON AND LEE opened its 214th year on September
W with a record enrollment of 1,230 students registered.
Not since the post-World War II years had the Uni-
versity’s student body topped the 1,200 mark. Slight in-
creases were noted in the size of the freshman class, whose
1962 total of 333 was 18 more than in 1961, and in the Law
School where the 1962 registration was 141, up from a 1961
figure of 128.

The first week for freshmen was normally hectic. After
Freshman Camp came registration and placement tests, rush
week, and talks with faculty advisers. Finally, there were
classes.

Troubadour theater.

 

Playwright Edward F. Albee’s Visit
A Vivid Troubadour “‘Experience”’

HEN THE CURRENT Broadway
Wa Who’s Afraid of Vir-
ginia Woolf?, opened in New
York on the night of Saturday, Oc-
tober 13, a great many persons at
Washington and Lee and in Lex-
ington anxiously awaited the critics’
verdicts that normally make or
break a Broadway venture.

They felt a personal interest in
the play, for they had come to
know, or at least were briefly closely
associated with, the 34-year-old
playwright, Edward F. Albee.

Albee had spent two weeks at
Washington and Lee last May as
a visiting professor under the Uni-

FALL, 1962

versity’s Glasgow Program. He was
popularly received, particularly by
the Troubadour players who were
engaged in the production of two
of Albee’s successful “off Broad-
way” short plays. In view of what
has subsequently been written
about how difficult it is to really
know Edward Albee, the Trouba-
dour director, Dr. Cecil Jones, feels
they got to know him quite well.
When the critics had spoken, and
Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
was an established Broadway hit,
students and faculty at Washington
and Lee took added pride in their
association with a playwright who

was being compared to ‘Tennessee
Williams and Eugene O'Neil.

When Albee came to Washing-
ton and Lee, he was a successful
playwright, but he had never had
one of his works produced on
Broadway, nor had he written what
could be considered a full-length
play. His short works, such as The
American Dream and The Zoo
Story staged by the Troubadours,
had won acclaim “off Broadway’”’
and in Europe. He was recognized
by some as a coming power in the
theatre, an avant garde playwright
closely allied with the so-called
“theatre of the absurd.”

~I

Albee’s plays don’t always make |

sense to the people who see them,
but most theatergoers agree that
his work often packs the wallop
of an unforgettable experience.
That is the way Albee plans it, for
he believes that every play should
be an experience. He emphasized
this point in his informal sessions
with Washington and Lee students.
He believes’ that the -audience
should be unable to forget the play
after the final curtain, if the play-
wright has been effective.

If the ‘Troubadour productions
of his two plays were “experiences”
for the packed houses who viewed
them, then the mere fact of Albee’s
presence and influence was an un-
forgettable experience « for . the
young actors involved and for the
‘Troubadour’s director, Cecil Jones.

Albee arrived one week before
opening night of the double pre-
sciuita‘icn of his plays. During the
rehear,al period, he attcaded four
full rehearsals of both plays and
several private or informal confer-
ence; both with the director and
the student actors. Part of his duties
as a visiting Glasgow Professor was
to advise on the production of the
plays, and he took to his work with
enthusiasm.

fiow would it feel to direct or act
in a play with the playwright look-
ing on, notebook in hand? Dr.
Jones found it a “pleasant and prof-
itable’” experience, and his student
colleagues agree.

Dr. Jones recalls that Albee’s
involvement as an advisor was dif-
ferent for each play. For The Amer-
ican Dream, he tended to work
through the director, passing his
comments on the performances to
Jones, who would in turn relay Al-
bee’s suggestions to the cast. In
The Zoo Story, which required only
two actors, Albee often chose to
go over his notes in considerable de-
tail with the young men, ‘Tim Mor-
ton of Roanoke and John Dunnell
of Brooklyn.

“His comments were always help-

ful,” adds Jones. “He recognized
the limitations of non-professionals,
and he offered criticism which the
actors could both understand and
use to better their work. We could
not have hoped that his advice and
the manner in which he gave it
would have been better than it
was.”

Dunnell described his association
with Albee as “wonderful.” ‘Mr.
Albee was able to give the actors
a deeper understanding of the
meaning of the plays and an ac-
curate insight into the motivation
of the characters, Dunnell says. ‘In
reading or seeing an Albee play,
it isn’t hard to be confused and up-
set in trying to pinpoint his real

 

EDWARD F. ALBEE

meaning. ‘Talking with Mr. Albee
gave me an exciting revelation in-
to his fascinating mind.”

Andy Adelson of Baltimore, who
had a leading role in The Ameri-
can Dream, says it is one thing
to discuss a play with the director,
but it is a “rare privilege’ to be
able to discuss it with the director
and the playwright. “At first I was
frightened at the prospect of a play-
wright criticizing my interpretation
of: fis play, Adelson: pecalis..
think Mr. Albee’s visit was one of
the most exciting things this cam-
pus has experienced since I have
been ‘here; *

In his contacts with students and
faculty, Albee is remembered as
charming and sociable. He spent
many hours with student and facul-

ty members in ‘bull sessions” that
extended into the early morning
hours. Jones says these contacts
benefited the students as much as
his classroom visits or rehearsal
work.

“He was willing and able to
talk—and listen—for hours,” Says
Jones. “And always, without mak-
ing his companions seem uncom-
fortable, he seemed to study the
people around him.”

Students learned Albee’s views
on a number of topics:

How he writes: “A play is writ-
te pretty much in the head. The
original impetus for a play comes
from some small, nagging thought
that you don’t pay much attention
to but is constantly recurring.
When I sit down to type, it only
takes me a month or so of actual
writing to complete a play.”

On college drama: “College stu-
dents seem to be more serious in
their approach to the theater. The
amount of enthusiasm and know-
ledge is somewhat greater than
when I was an undergraduate. I
have noticed that they have a good
awareness of the avant garde move-
ment.”’

Because of his youthful appear-
ance, Albee could easily pass for a
Washington and Lee student and
probably was mistaken for just that
during his comings and goings on
the campus. His own collegiate ex-
perience was brief.

He was born in Washington, but
grew up in New York after having
been adopted by a wealthy New
York family at the age of two
weeks. He graduated from Choate
School, but his undergraduate ca-
reer at ‘Trinity was curtailed when
he was expelled for cutting classes
and chapel. He wrote his first play
when he was 12, and his first pro-
fessional production, The Zoo
Story, was staged in 1959. Two
other plays, The Death of Bessie
Smith and The Sandbox, also pre-
miered in Europe, while The Amer- —

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

ican Dream opened in New York
in January, 1962.

Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
was described by the New York
Times critic, Howard ‘Taubman,
as a “wry and electric evening in
the theater.” Most other critics
agreed, although one dissenter
summed the long play up this way:
“...three and a half hours long;
four characters wide, and a cesspool
deep.”

This latter commentary reflected
Albee’s great ability to amuse and
horrify, often at the same time. Mr.
Taubman wrote of Virginia Woolf:
“Although Mr. Albee’s vision is
grim and sardonic, he is never sol-
em...Mr. Albee’s dialogue 1s
dipped in acid, yet ripples with
the relish of the ludicrous.”

Albee provided an insight into
his philosophy of the theater when
he gave a public lecture while at
Washington and Lee. Speaking in
the Troubadour Theater, he de-
clared:

“A playwright is not only a crea-
tive person who merely writes, He
is, as well, or at least should be,
sort of a demonic social critic, a
force for things that are right, as
opposed to things that are cor-
rect, for example. It’s the play-
wright’s responsibility to be a kind
of national conscience.”

“Our playwrights,’ Albee went

ances with Troubadour actors,

l-r, ANDY ADELSON, [1M Morton,
and JOHN DUNNELL.

FALL, 1962

on, “are encouraged to congratu-
late their audiences, to reassure
them that everything is just dandy,
when it’s more likely than not that
things are not so dandy. Our play-
wrights are encouraged to pat the
audience on the back, to tell them
that their values are fine. Well, it
seems to me that if you have a cul-
ture that needs to be patted on the

back and told that its values are

fine, maybe there’s something a
little suspect about those values.”

Albee’s estimation of the relative
importance of various persons in
the theater was unusual. He said
that playwrights, directors, pro-
ducers, and actors have little to do
with what the theatergoer sees on
Broadway. The “chief aesthetician”
who controls Broadway is the real
estate owner, the man who owns
the theater. Albee says the second
most important person in the New
York theater is the lady executive
of the theater parties whose pat-
ronage often determines the finan-
cial success of a production.

“Well, naturally, in the long
run,” Albee concludes, “no really
good theater can come from this
sort of thing. This is commercial-
ism, big business.”

In the audience at the ‘Trouba-
dour Theater the night Albee spoke
was the noted American author,
Carson McCullers, who was visiting

in Lexington. She is a friend of Al-
bee’s and he introduced her from
the stage, and later, after his formal
talk she joined him on stage for
a question period and discussion.

Jones was delighted with this
literary event, because it brought to
the Troubadour stage simultan-
eously two markedly — successful
writers, and focused attention on
the fact that Albee’s next play will
be an adaptation of Miss McCul-
lers’ novella, Ballad of the Sad
Cafe. Although she had read AI-
bee’s plays, Miss McCullers had her
first opportunity to witness a pro-
duction of his on closing night at
the ‘Troubadour Theater.

Albee became so interested in
the Troubadours’ work with his
plays that he extended his visit be-
yond the planned ten days so that
he could be present during all the
performances. Afterwards, at the
traditional cast party on closing
night, he complimented the players,
the production staff, and the direc-
tor.

“If I could find a group of actors
in New York who would work as
hard and as long as the ‘Trouba-
dours without being paid for it, I
would never worry again,” he told
them.

The way Albee’s star is rising on
Broadway now, he won't have to
worry for quite some time.

 

The Board of Trustees

Mr. Caskie Resigns as Rector,

Dr. Hutcheson Is His Successor

R. JAMES R. CASKIE, 06, Lynch-

burg attorney and civic lead-

er, has resigned as Rector of Wash-

ington and Lee University’s Board
of ‘Trustees.

Mr. Caskie, who is 77, informed
the Board of his decision at its reg-
ular October meeting. He = said
health considerations prevent him
from continuing as Rector, al-
though he will remain a member
of the Board.

Elected to succeeed Mr. Caskie
as Rector was Dr. J. Morrison Hut-
cheson, ‘02, Richmond physician
and professor emeritus at the Med-
ical College of Virginia.

Mr. Caskie joined Washington
and Lee’s Board in 1924, and was
elected Rector in 1953. He is a grad-
uate of Washington and Lee, re-
ceiving his A.B. degree in 1906 and
his LL.B. degree in 1909. Dr. Hut-
cheson, who is 79, received his A.B.
degree at Washington and Lee in
1902. He was elected to the Board
of ‘Trustees in 1935, and has served
on its executive committee since
1940.

“Under Mr. Caskie’s rectorship
the University has made great
strides in improving its academic
program and _ physical facilities,”
President Fred C. Cole commented.
“The dedication of Mr. Caskie to
his Alma Mater is clearly indicated

10

in his willingness to continue as a
trustee, although he feels it neces-
sary to relinquish his chairman-
ship. Dr. Hutcheson’s long service
and close association with the Uni-
versity gives assurance that Wash-
ington and Lee will continue its ed-
ucational leadership.”

Mr. Caskie is senior partner in
the Lynchburg law firm of Caskie,
Frost, Davidson and Watts. In ad-
dition to his service as Rector, Mr.
Caskie also has acted as an unpaid
general counsel to the University.

A native of Lovingston, Va., Mr.
Caskie began his law practice in

Mr. JAMES R. CASKIE

Lynchburg shortly after graduation
from Washington and Lee. He was
first a partner with his father,
George Evans Caskie, and upon his
father’s death in 1919, Mr. Caskie
practiced alone until 1925 when
the first of his present partners
joined his firm.

Among his church and civic ac-
tivities, Mr. Caskie has served as
director and secretary and treasurer
of the Presbyterian Orphans Home
in Lynchburg for 25 years, and also

years at the Women’s College in
Richmond while attending the
Medical College of Virginia, where
he received his M.D. degree in 1909.

After further graduate study in
Baltimore and Boston, Dr. Hutche-
son became an instructor at the
Medical College in 1911, and was
named professor of therapeutics in

1914 and professor of clinical medi-

being bigger and better each time

26-28 maintained the pattern, for
a record total of 1,107 parents and
guests registered for the full pro-
gram offered by the University and
the Parents’ Advisory Council.

‘The meeting of the Council it-
self went on record as one of the
most productive ever under the
able leadership of Sherwood Wise,
°32. Discussion involved a host of
matters pertaining to student life at
the University, and Council mem-
bers expressed unusual concern for
the mounting social expenditures of
students. The Council requested
the University make a study of the
matter and report to the Council
on its findings next fall. Donald A.
Holden, Newport News shipbuild-

the Advisory Council.

Parents came from 28 different

The sunrise was welcome and
beautiful, but the coast could not
be seen because of the dense clouds.
Then the lights of Dakar! We land-
ed and were strangely affected by
our first real look at African soil.
The air was muggy and the day
gloomy. A comment: “This looks
like San Antonio.”

Accra—[the capital of Ghana]. As
we made ready to leave the jet,

even the hot, barren landing strip
of the Accra Airport was welcome.
Then straight to the beautifully dif-
ferent University of Ghana at La-
gon, just outside the city. Orange
roofs over cream colored walls—liz-
ards freely roaming the grounds
and entering the buildings—lovely
orange flowers. The noon lunch—
our first taste of African food—a
beef soup with rice—tasted great,
and then the pepper hit—wham!
I'm going to learn to get used to it
though. Then a picnic given by
the U.S. Embassy for all Americans
in Ghana [July 4th]. Just like
home—fried chicken, touch foot-
ball; but it broke my concentra-
tion of making the transition. It

Thurs., July 5, 1962

After dinner we went by bus into
Accra, some of the University stu-
dents acting as guides. Already we
felt an attachment for the students
in that they were our “middle-men”’
to the people. Walked and walked
through the streets—market “mam-
mies” selling everything. The chil-
dren reacted favorably to our pres-
ence. Couldn’t tell about the
adults—they smiled, but I still felt
uneasy. Arrived at the Lido [night
club]—danced the “High Life”
[West Africa’s latest dance craze|
with both Americans and Ghana-
ians—felt my background tying me
down for the first time, but I over-
came it.

With each day’s passing, we are
getting to know each other much
better, and now certain the Ghana-
ian students are going out of their
way to be kind. A few appear
unconcerned, of course, but the
majority enjoy conversing with us
as friends—no attempt yet to engage
us in political discussions. [I learn-
ed later that this campus was one
of the most Western-minded and
government-opposed spots in the
country. |

one goes to get inter-city tnanspor-
tation, the lorry—either a truck or
small bus—being the chief means of
travel in West Africa.] ‘The lorry to
Koforidua was packed as always.
Decided on a‘fair rate with the
driver and settled down for our
two-hour ride. Village after village
of yellow, concrete block houses
with tin roofs. Now and then a
modern establishment to contrast
with the old. Passed the site of
Nkrumah’s [Ghana’s ““Osagyefo’—
translated as “savior” or “‘messiah’’]
newest rest home. Arrived in Kofor-
idua and met my host, Mr. Daniel
Dankwa, the principal of Ghana
Secondary School, the local high
school. Mr. Dankwa’s household is
traditionally Ghanaian in that you
never know exactly how many peo-
ple live there—cousins, nieces—peo-
ple coming and going. Went to the
home of a young American couple
who, along with another young
man, are the U.S. Peace Corps rep-
resentatives in Koforidua. All three
are teachers at the high school.

Tues., July ro, 7962

Went to the high school and
roamed at will. Mr. Dankwa gave
me leave to enter any class and talk
about whatever I pleased. Noticed
the formal atmosphere—the class
stood upon my entrance, and each
pupil stood when speaking. ‘The

intelligent ones made themselves
heard and showed real interest in
what was going on. Those who were
lost betrayed this by expressionless
faces. Went with Bob Crisco [Peace
Corps] to his home for lunch and
was convinced of the Ghanaian love
for red pepper when it turned up
in the peanut butter that his house-
boy made.

I am learning a few words of the
Twi dialect now, but I need to
know it only for the sake of courte-
sy, since almost all of the Ghana-
ians with whom I have come in
contact speak English. [The school
classes are taught in English.]

Wed., July rz, 1962

Had a good talk with Mr. Dank-
wa tonight. I find that he was edu-
cated at St. Andrew’s in FEdin-
burgh as well as at Indiana Uni-
versity. We discussed what Ghana’s
needs are. As he sees it, it is a mis-
take not putting first things first.
Give the people education—teach
them how to help themselves. He
is not impressed with the Russian
exhibition, which opened today, in
Accra. “What does Ghana want
with a helicopter?” He was most
impressed with the Canadian exhi-
bition, which took Ghanaian re-
sources and used them to show the
people economical ways of accom-
plishing things with what is at
hand. ’m seeing more and more
that the educated class is antti-
Nkrumah and that the illiterate
just don’t care. I have as yet to
meet strong government support-
ers.

Mr. Danka’s niece, Amma, is still
very shy around me, and the baby
in the family downstairs cries when-
ever he sees me. I hear that a few
families still practice the custom,
carried over from the pre-indepen-
dence days, of frightening young

15

children with animal skins and
saying, “A white man is coming.”

Sat., July 14, 1962

Went to a Roman Catholic wed-
ding in Accra today with Mr. Dank-
wa, who was best man. The couple
had been married by native custom
ten years before and were now
having it blessed in a Christian
church. ‘The reception was worth
noting. Everyone sat around the
periphery of the room and was serv-
ed beer or soft drinks. ‘Then one
by one all of the guests rose to toast
the bride and groom, myself in-
cluded. We had to leave early in
order to attend a school banquet in
Koforidua honoring an Indian
teacher from S. Africa, who was
leaving after a_ three-year stay.
Called on to express his views of
Ghana, the gentleman mentioned
that he was thankful for the oppor-
tunity to live and work in a non-
racial society. He will now move
back under Apartheid in which In-
dians find themselves in the posi-
tion of subordination to whites, re-
gardless of their level of mentality.
I think he was very courageous in
going back where he felt his real
task lay.

Wed., July 18, 1962

This afternoon I got my first
taste of Ghana’s Young Pioneers,
the youth branch of the Conven-
tion People’s Party [the political
party in Ghana]. At the Presbyteri-
an middle school we saw students
assembled on the athletic field for
a review of the marching and sing-
ing that they have been taught.
During the course of the practice,
the following dialogue between
leader and group was repeated:

Leader: Nkrumah can do no
wrong.

Group: Nkrumah is
leader.

Leader:
Messiah.
Group: Nkrumah is
Messiah.

our

Leader: Nkrumah

Group: He never dies.

I got chills after that one.
Fri. July (20,. 1962

Said goodbye to Mr. Dankwa and
Koforidua and headed for Accra
where we met others in our group
and started for Agbozume near the
‘Togo border, the site of our work
camp. We've been hearing that this
part of the country is partially
flooded because of the worst rainy
season since 1925. Well, I can con-
firm this now. Within fifty feet of
our beds the water is standing

several feet deep. There will be
fifty-two of us from the U.S., Ghana,
Sierra Leone, U. K., Nigeria, and
the Ivory Coast. We have our own
little community—kitchen, supplies,
sleeping quarters, latrines—all with-
in a compound loaned to us by one
of the village’s wealthier inhabi-
tants. The dimensions of the
church-to-be are roped off and the
concrete blocks lie waiting. We
start to work Monday.

Sat., July 28, 1962

The work is progressing at a
desirable rate, the few skilled labor-
ers directing the unskilled mass of
students. This being Saturday, we
worked only from 5:30-10:30 a.m.
and were then free to go to the
ocean at Denn some ten miles away.

I really felt in the African spirit on
the lorry with the Ghanaians drum-
ming and singing in dialect and
the driver stopping to pick up his
friends along the way [transporta-
tion is very informal]. The sight
of the huge expanse of beach,
palms, and ocean, unmarred by
umbrellas and trash was a vehicle
to romanticism. Saw a group of
native fishermen going to sea in
a canoe with their nets. The canoes
don’t seem too safe—holes plugged
with anything. The men pushed
off into the violent surf that threat-
ened to capsize them, and then they
exhibited beautifully precise pad-

 

dling. There’s probably been very
little change in their methods in
the last hundred years. ‘These peo-
ple build thatch huts along the
beach during the fishing season and
then move on, the huts being de-
stroyed each rainy season. On the
return trip, Denn’s own stone god
was introduced to us, and we were
told that the yearly sacrifice of
a goat would take place on Wednes-
day. It seems that their god speaks
to the priest and tells him what he
wants sacrificed.

Wed., Aug. 1, 1962

The group took a side trip today
to Ho, a government center about
seventy miles away. The road was
dirt and full of holes so that our
average speed was less than 20

m.p.h. This is the first time I’ve
ever played the part of a battery,
but the driver seemed to feel that
with all of the available man-
power, there was no sense in using
up the lorry’s battery in starting.
And there was plenty of opportun-
ity for our pushing service—we were
continually losing bolts from var-
ious places and having flat tires. I
really never thought we’d make it,
but the sight of an ice-cream sign
in Ho made it all worth-while. Pll
never take refrigeration for granted
again. After traveling to the site
of the Volta River Dam project at
Akosombo [to which the U.S. has
loaned a large sum of money] we
headed back for Agbozume in the
dark, and by the squeaks and
squeals registered, we must have
run over half of the animals be-
tween the two towns.

Tues. Aug. 7, 1962

The “Ghanaian Times’ [party-
controlled newspaper] today car-
ried a picture of the Rt. Rev. Rich-
ard Roseveare, Anglican Bishop of
Accra, along with the headline,
“This man must go.” [Bishop Rose-
veare was the man behind our
group’s coming to Ghana— he or-

ganized the whole affair, met us at —

the airport, and visited us at the
work camp.| In his speech last
week at Cape Coast, the Bishop
voiced a resolution of the Christian
Council of Ghana, in which he de-
nounced the Young Pioneer group
as “‘godless.’”’ The newspaper article
linked the presence of this type of
“white colonialist” with the “‘for-
elgn-backed” plot to assassinate
Nkrumah last week on Tamale by
the planting of a bomb. The Minis-
ter of the Interior is now calling
for his deportation. In discussion
tonight with some of the Ghana-
ians, I learned that their view on
the Young Pioneers is that it is good
in that it teaches patriotism but bad
in that it attributes some divine
qualities to Nkrumah. Radio Gha-
na today broadcast the Osagyefo’s

FALL, 1962

return to Accra and played him up
as the returning conqueror, de-
livered from harm by Providence.

Sat., Aug. 11, 1962

Our last work day in Agbozume.
Little of our three-week effort will
ever show—most of our man-hours
have been spent in laying the foun-
dation and flooring, and the visible
structure is yet to be built. Most
of the Americans are depressed by
this, but the work will be continued
as funds become available. The
priest here, Father Agordekpe, ex-
pects that five years will pass before
the church is completed. But time
in Ghana has a different meaning
than that which we give to it. Life
is unhurried and time is an un-
limited quantity.

The work camp put on a show
for the town today, utilizing any
talent that could be dug up, as
evidenced by the fact that I was
part of a singing group. Tonight
we tried to evaluate the work camp
in general and agreed that while
the work itself was a bit discour-
aging, the other benefits of living
at close quarters with others from

fourteen Americans here at the
hospital and in the relatively short
time they have been established,
the village has seen its child-birth
death rate drop from something
around 40-50 per cent to a mere 1
per cent.

The news that Bishop Roseveare
was today given five hours to leave
the country brought a sad end to
the day. Radio Ghana reported that
he was “a man whose presence in
Ghana was not conducive to the
public good.” As one member of
group remarked, “How many
groups of people can Nkrumah af-
ford to offend?”

* * *

Our remaining ten days in Gha-
na were spent hopping from one
spot to another, trying to cram as
much in as possible. In reflecting
on the trip as a whole, I know that
no other two months have ever
contained so much. We learned, we
became more objective, and we
came to realize how much there is
to know and how slightly we had
scratched the surface. But Africa is
real for me now—I know real people
there—I have lived and talked and

“. . LT know real people there.”

all over the world more than made
up for this. The friendships made
and frank discussions entered into
are evidence of our compatibility.
I no longer see anything trite or
empty in the statement that people
everywhere have much in common.
I know this now for a fact.

Mon., Aug. 13, 1962

Today our group of twenty-four
left Agbozume and the work camp
behind and, packed into a lorry,
began the ten-day trip of the North
that will bring us back to Accra in
time for our flight home. Our des-
tination—the 120-bed Presbyterian
hospital at Worawora. ‘There are

socialized with them. I know, too,
that the average American’s view
of Africa and what it is really like
are vastly different. You can read
and read and you'll never really
understand. The chance for college-
age students to participate in the
kind of experience that was mine
last summer is one of the most 1m-
portant opportunities open for
young people today. If I sound like
a crusader it’s because I’ve really
got something to sell—the desire
to break out of the ordinary and
do something that will open your
eyes and cause you to want to open
the eyes of others to what’s hap-
pening among people and to people
in today’s world.

The Generals Lose a Game,

But Win a Conference Title

ASHINGTON AND LEE just sul-
fered through its worst foot-
ball season in three years.

At least, that’s the attitude of
some of the football experts who
plot their strategy on the spinning
stools down at McCrum’s.

After all, the Generals did lose
a game. And they were a full touch-
down off the 33-point-per-game
scoring pace of the undefeated 1961
team. And worse yet, they gave up
an average of nearly 12 points a
game, instead of the meager five
they permitted in both 1961 and
1960.

Actually, the 1962 season was a
tremendous success for Coach Lee
McLaughlin’s 48-man varsity squad.
The Generals compiled an impres-
sive 8-1 record for the campaign,
losing only to undefeated Emory
and Henry by a thrilling 38-33
score, and they captured the first
football championship of the new-
ly-formed College Athletic Confer-
ence.

It’s true that the long string of
21 games without defeat ended on
a dreary afternoon deep in South-
west Virginia, but the Generals now
have a winning streak of six games
to carry over into 1963. |

squad reflect a combination of
sound coaching, outstanding lead-
ership by the squad’s seniors, and
dedicated effort by the other jun-
iors and sophomores.

Few teams anywhere could lose
18 senior lettermen and three oth-
er monogram winners from an un-
beaten squad, and then bounce
back for a near-miss crack at an-
other perfect year. ‘The Generals
started the campaign with five of
their first six 1961 guards gone, the
first two centers graduated, and the
incomparable leadership of quar-
terback Steve Suttle no longer
available.

The Generals went on winning,
though, because many relatively in-
experienced boys “came through”
for Coach Mac with the kind of ef-
fort that sparkled occasionally but
generally was the kind that simply
got the job done well.

There was junior Mike Sheffey
who became a fine offensive center
and teamed with junior Steve Dav-

enport as linebacker replacements
for the missing Little All-American,

guard Bill Angel, a fourth-stringer
last year, who earned a starting
berth. By season’s end, W&L’s traps
were springing backs loose in 1960-
61 fashion, largely on the fine
blocking of Angel and senior guard
Mickey Walker. There was sopho-
more Doug Davis who took over
the punting chores. He fumbled
away the first pass from center he
tried to handle in the opening
game, but that was his last mistake.
Davis seldom kicked them far, but
he got them off and kept the Gen-
erals out of many a hole.

Of course, there were many truly
outstanding performances. Junior
halfback Stuart Yoffe gained nearly
500 yards rushing at an average
gain of over seven yards a carry.
Senior fullback Tommy Keesee was
the backfield’s workhorse, punch-
ing out over 400 yards rushing,
scoring a team-leading 58 points,

and throwing a touchdown strike
on his only pass attempt.

Senior Tackle Bobby Payne, an
all-State choice in 1961, led the
defense and was an outstanding
blocker. Junior end Johnny Madi-
son gave further indication that he
may be one of the finest flankmen
in W&L gridiron history.

For the first time since 1950,
when the Generals won the South-
ern Conference title, Washington
and Lee laid claim to a football
championship. Only four teams
were competing for the College
Athletic Conference title; and
W&L won it by defeating Centre
38-22, Sewanee 8-0, and Southwest-
ern at Memphis 22-0. Next year,
the Generals will defend their
CAC championship against these
teams plus the rejuvenated Wash-
ington (St. Louis) Bears.

The Generals started the 1962
season by defeating Hampden-Syd-

This set the stage for the clash

added four more ‘TD’s and threw
three two-point conversion passes

victory margin. In between Haw-
kins’ first and last touchdowns, the
Generals managed to squeeze in
some scoring of their own, at one
time holding a 33-14 lead. EXH got
its winning score with less than four
minutes to play. With a first down
on the General one-yard line, the
Wasps took four cracks at the W&L

game with wins over Centre and
Southwestern and needed only to
defeat the Generals to claim the
league title. The game was a mud-
dy, defensive standoff that went to
the Generals when they capitalized
on a short Sewanee punt that slith-
ered out of bounds on the ‘Tiger
38. Nine plays later W&L had its
8-0 win.

The season finale which brought
the Generals the CAC trophy was a

ward to 1963 with guarded optim-
ism. The 1962 freshman team com-
piled only a 2-4-1 record, but the
Brigadiers played rugged football
against a strong prep and military
school schedule, and they should
add needed backbone to the Gen-
eral defense next season.

Only eight seniors were on the
1962 squad, all of whom share an
enviable accomplishment. In three
years of varsity competition, they
helped bring Washington and Lee
a football record of 25 victories, one
defeat, one tie—a job well done, to
say the least.

From THE NATIONAL OBSERVER

“No Pay, No Pressure, No Hypocrisy;

Five Schools Make Sports Fun Again”’

A National Newspapers Story
On the New College Athletic Conference
Is Reprinted for Alumni Readers

N THE MIDST of the flourishing football factories of
I the South and Midwest, a small band of schools
stands for these athletic ideals: No pay, no pressure,
no hypocrisy. They’re proving that intercollegiate
sports can be an amateur pastime of fun and success-
ful for all—players, fans, alumni, even faculty.

‘The group is the brand new College Athletic Con-
ference. Its members are Washington and Lee Univer-
sity, located here in the shadows of the Blue Ridge
Mountains of Virginia; Centre College of Danville,
Kentucky; the University of the South, at Sewanee,
‘Tennessee; Southwestern of Memphis, and Washing-
ton of St. Louis. Their symbol of league supremacy:
An old locomotive bell donated by the Norfolk and
Western Railway.

Conference rules say simply: “All participation in
sports by members of its teams shall be solely because
of interest in and the enjoyment of the game. No
financial aid shall be given to any student which is
conditioned upon, or for the purpose of encouraging,
his participation in intercollegiate athletics.”

On the Honor System

What’s more, an honor system governs the confer-
ence. Each member is expected to live up to its com-
mitments without any policing.

This new athletic life is not due to a lack of an
athletic tradition. Centre’s famed Prayin’ Colonels
claimed the national collegiate football title in 1921.
Sewanee’s team of 1899 won 12 games without a loss,
whipping Texas, Texas A & M, Tulane, Louisiana
State, and Mississippi. Southwestern won %, lost 1, tied
1 in 1938, and included Mississippi State among its

22

victims. In 1950, Washington and Lee won 8, lost ,
and played in the Gator Bowl.

Long ago, though, each of the schools quit subsi-
dizing athletics, and knuckled down to the job of
turning out students. Their decision—and the new con-
ference—are steps in American education’s drift to-
ward higher academic standards.

Putting a coat and tie on an athlete (as Washing-
ton and Lee requires), and making him go to class
doesn’t mean that a school is an athletic pushover.
Washington and Lee’s Generals were undefeated in
football the past two years. Sewanee won 5, lost 2, and
tied 1 last year.

Washington and Lee typifies the CAC’s spirit.
There are 48 boys in this year’s football squad, and
before the season’s out, every one of them will get to
play. In fact, most of them will play in every game.
Says Coach Lee McLaughlin, “I simply feel that it’s
good for morale to get a chance to play.” Besides, he
adds, ‘“Che boy who’s fresh plays better.”

Spark of Leadership

McLaughlin isn’t a tough coach, but he’s able to
set afire a spirit that makes the team hustle. Boys run
full speed from late afternoon laboratories to the
practice field, unbuttoning shirts as they go, so they
won't miss practice.

Bobby Payne, a tackle and senior co-captain from
Louisville, Kentucky, comments: “They don’t drive us
until we’re ready to drop dead. We all have a good
time. When football becomes a task and drudgery, it’s
not football. Here we enjoy it.”

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

The school’s athletic department is under the
watchful eyes of a faculty committee. Budget, sched-
ules, eligibility, and personnel matters are in the com-
mittee’s hands.

Coach McLaughlin says that “I don’t even want
the scholarship committee to know which boys I’m in-
terested in.”

Dr. William Hinton, chairman of the psychology
department, and head of the faculty athletic commit-
tee, is happy to have on campus some students who
happen to be good athletes.

“T like to see a few hard-nose boys around,” he
says. “It adds a little flavor.” Hard-nose athletes are
boys who look the part—big, burly, tough.

On the typical campus, perhaps 5 per cent of the
male students take part in varsity athletics. At Wash-
ington and Lee, it’s 33 per cent—350 of the all-male
school’s 1,050 undergraduates. And under the pro-
gram of purity, no sport is more important than any
other. So-called minor sports—soccer, lacrosse, golf,
tennis—get all the money and equipment they need.

The amateurism delights athletic director Cy
Twombly, the leathery, 41-year veteran of Washing-
ton and Lee athletics. He says: “We don’t have to
keep up with the Jones any more. It’s an entirely dif-
ferent atmosphere.” |

In the old days, he said, an athletic association ran
the school’s intercollegiate athletics, and existed al-
most entirely apart from the rest of the school.

He adds: “Now we’re running our own house.

Coaches and athletic people are a lot better off. If they
keep their noses clean, they don’t have a thing to
worry about.”

President Cole’s View

Washington and Lee President Fred Cole sees the
CAC as giving the collegiate athlete a “fair shake” at
last. This may sound peculiar in view of critics’ charges
that college athletes are recruited, coddled, and ride ina
educational gravy train that education can't really
afford.

But Dr. Cole’s point is interesting. To him, and
to others in the CAC, the pressures of big-time col-
legiate athletics shunt the athlete into an_ isolated
corner of the campus. He spends most of his years pur-
suing one thing: Athletics. Dr. Cole reasons that if
he’s brought into the main-stream of campus life, and
forced to live and study as any other student, his hort-
zon will expand. New talents will be uncovered.

CAC officials say they aren’t crusading for puriiy
in college athletics. Their policy fits them fine. At the
same time, Dr. Cole wryly says: “A great many schools
could profit from this.”

He insists that there’s no de-emphasis on athletics
at all. To the contrary, the program aims at making
athletics open to all. In Washington and Lee’s case,
it’s worked. Dr. Cole used the word deemphasis in this
sense: “If a kid is the best football player in the world
but doesn’t have the grades, he’s de-emphasized out of
school.”

Washington and Lee’s Financial Aid
To Undergraduates Shows Big Gain

NDERGRADUATE financial aid at

Washington and Lee has in-
creased by nearly 400 per cent over
an eight-year period, current figures
from the University’s director of
student financial aid and _ scholar-
ships disclose.

Dean James D. Farrar, associate
dean of admissions and director of
the financial aid program, says that
219 undergraduates are sharing this
year in a record amount of $171,904
in aid of various kinds. In 1954-55,
University financial assistance to
undergraduates totaled only $44,-

O70.

The current number of students
receiving assistance represents 18
per cent of the undergraduate en-
rollment of 1,089 students. The
School of Law’s aid program for its
141 students is administered sep-
arately, Dean Farrar reminded.

This eight-year pattern of rising
financial aid to students was boost-
ed in September, 1960, with the in-
auguration of a scholarship pro-
gram. A key feature of the three-
year-old program is a loan system
through which applicants for finan-
cial assistance have an opportunity
to borrow from the university at
least a portion of the cost of their
education. The loan aspect of the
program is similar to loans offered
under the National Defense Educa-
tion Act although Washington and

26

Lee aid funds involve no federal
money.

Some 200 students shared in
$154,119 in aid during the first
year of the new program. The to-
tal aid jumped to $169,g92—more
than a $15,000 increase—in 1961-62.

When the program was begun
in 1960, university officials expres-
sed the hope that the new system
would make a Washington and Lee
education available to all qualified
high school graduates, regardless of
their temporary , financial limita-
tions.

“This year we were able to offer
assistance to all those students well
qualified to assume work at Wash-
ington and Lee and for whom fin-
ancial aid was a necessity,’’ Dean
Farrar said.

In the 333-man freshman class
this year, 64 new students are shar-
ing $51,720 in aid. Last year, 59
freshmen received financial assis-
tance.

The $171,904 in total aid this
year is being furnished by endowed
and competitive scholarships, loans
and campus jobs, Farrar said. Av-
erage amount of aid to students this
year is $810 in a range of $100 to
31,900.

Top awards in endowed funds in-
clude the George F. Baker and the
Robert E. Lee scholarships. ‘These
are awarded to the most highly
qualified students for their full

careers at Washington and Lee. In-
cluding five freshmen, there are
11 Baker Scholars receiving a_ to-
tal of $11,560. Current Robert E.
Lee Scholars—five of whom are
freshmen—total 17. They are shar-
ing in $16,300 in funds.

Although some awards may re-
quire special qualifications as re-
quested by their donors, all Wash-
ington and Lee financial aid is
granted on the basis of merit and
need, Farrar said. Each semester,
a review of the recipient’s record
and need is made, and renewal is
based on the quality of work and
current need.

Special assistance from the Rob-
ert E. Lee Research Fund is not in-
cluded in this year’s total under-
graduate financial aid, Farrar point-
ed out.

 

m LT. COL. JACK P. BURCH has been
named new head of Washington
and Lee’s military science depart-
ment.

The career Army officer assumed
his duties as head of the university’s
ROTC program in mid-November.
He came to Washington and Lee
from a one-year tour as resident en-
gineer in the Far East District,
Corps of Engineers, in Korea.

“Old George” Will Be Restored, Preserved

FOR A WHILE, they had General

for “founding fathers.”

The Recumbent Statue in Lee
Chapel is still in its protective
housing, but the woodpecker-proof
cage around “Old George” has been
removed and first steps taken to

restore the famous wooden statue
atop Washington Hall.

Workers who chipped away the
multi-layered accumulation of years
of painting were amazed to find
such detail in the carving and
workmanship of the statue. It was
executed in 1842 by Mathew Kahle,
a Lexington cabinet maker and

presented by him to the University.

Woodpeckers, weather, and in-

proof protection, and repainted for
future Washington and Lee gen-
erations.

heads the list of contributors to the
Autumn issue of Shenandoah,
Washington and Lee University’s
quarterly literary magazine. The is-
sue includes a variety of poetry,
fiction and criticism by 15 different
contributors.

“This issue has no_ particular
theme,” Shenandoah editor James
Boatwright said. “We have placed
the emphasis on the best fiction and
verse available and included less
criticism than usual this time.” The
Fall issue marks the first under the
direction of Boatwright, an instruc-
tor in English at Washington and
Lee who was named to the editor’s
post for a one-year term last Spring.

Cummings, who died in August,
submitted his poem for Shenandoah

New Era ot Good Will

Article by VMI Registrar
Reviews Areas of Cooperation

Between Two Institutions

Which Benefit Both Schools

(Editors Note: This fall, the cadet corps at Vir-
ginia Military Institute staged a corps review in honor
of the Washington and Lee University student body.
Student body officers and some 300 other Washington
and Lee students attended the impressive ceremony
on the VMI parade ground. In response, the Wash-
ington and Lee student body invited the cadet corps
to be its guests at the W&L-Sewanee football game.
Because of bad weather and other factors, relatively
few cadets attended the game, but the gesture was
greatly appreciated by the corps. It all points up a
very happy relationship existing now between the two
schools and among the students and faculties. Presi-
dent Cole and Maj. Gen. George R. E. Shell are good
friends, and the attitudes of everyone at the both
schools reflect this cordial relationship of friendship
and mutual respect. Printed at right is an article by
Dr. Allan Carlsson, registrar at VMI and assistant
to the Dean of the Faculty, which appeared recently
in the bulletin of the University Center in Virginia,
an organization promoting cooperative ventures
among virtually all Virginia colleges and universities.
Washington and Lee alumni will take pride in the
harmony and good will that extends all along Letcher

eration possible between the Vir-
ginia Military Institute and Wash-
ington and Lee University. Al-
though the two colleges are very
distinctive as institutions of higher
learning, it has been to the advan-
tage of each school to cooperate in
various areas. In May, 1961, at the
inauguration of Major General
George R. E. Shell as Superintend-
ent of VMI, Dr. Fred C. Cole, Pres-
ident of W&L, spoke of the coop-
eration in this manner:

The Virginia Military Insti-
tute and Washington and Lee
University have been neighbors
in Lexington and associates in
higher education for 122 years.
In the beginning of this long as-
sociation, authorities at both in-
stitutions foresaw a future of
close cooperation and develop-
ment for the two schools. This
vision of a working companion-
ship on many levels has been
achieved through personal and
academic relationships; yet, each
institution has utilized its own
special talents and facilities to
achieve distinction in education.

Lexington is one of a very few
educational centers in America
where there is such a clear dem-
onstration of what is often point-
ed to as one of the strengths or
virtues of American higher edu-
cation. I refer to the diversity of
the educational institutions
themselves. There is no set, pre-
scribed pattern or physical
framework for achieving learn-
ing, and the pursuit of excellence
traditionally has followed many
paths...It is my earnest wish
that we shall cooperate wherever
possible and continue to be
neighbors of the best sort.

There are four major areas of
this “working companionship”:
course offerings, the facilities, the

33

libraries, and equipment. A joint
program in elementary and _ inter-
mediate Russian is offered at the
present time. ‘wo professors, one
from each of the faculties, alter-
nate in teaching the two courses.
While this is the only joint offering
at present, the students and cadets
are free to enroll by payment of
a fee in any course at the neighbor-
ing institution, for which they are
qualified, if the course is not of-
fered at their school. Cadets have
enrolled at W&L in such courses as
Greek, accounting, and journalism,
while W&L students have enrolled
at VMI in several advanced science
courses. Everyone 1s welcome to the
lectures of the visiting scholars
from the University Center as well
as to attend other lectures and sem-
inars.

As the need has arisen, each
school has employed faculty mem-
bers of the other school on a part-
time basis. At present, (1961-62)
VMI professors are teaching classes
in philosophy, literature, and Latin

at W&L. In the recent past VMI has
used W&L faculty members to teach
such courses at fine arts and psy-
chology. The cooperative use of fac-
ulty has generally been in the area
of the liberal arts.

Most individuals become aware
of the cooperation between VMI
and W&L through the use of the
libraries. For approximately the
last fifteen years, both libraries
have made a duplicate author’s
card for each acquisition (except
in such special cases as W&L’s law
library) to be filed in the card in-
dex of the other school. Students
and faculty have stack and check-
out privileges in both libraries.
Some infrequently consulted refer-
ence works are purchased by only
one of the libraries when a single
copy will be sufficient for both
schools. Because W&L microfilms
The New York Times, VMI does
not retain a complete file of this
newspaper.

VMI and W&L also share the use
of some items of equipment. For

instance, the W&L astronomy clas-
ses use the VMI planetarium, and
the observatory now under con-
struction at W&L will be available
to VMI astronomy classes. VMI’s
only football game in Lexington
last season (1961) was played on
W&L’s Wilson Field.

In addition to these four major
areas of cooperation between VMI
and W&L, the faculties have also
cooperated in community projects
such at the Rockbridge Concert-
Theatre Series, the annual Rock-
bridge Art Exhibit, and fund rais-
ing drives for charity. It may also
be mentioned that in the past few
years over 20 graduates of VMI
have attended W&L’s law school.
One instructor from VMI earned a
law degree at W&L and continues
to teach at VMI as well as in W&L’s
law school.

VMI and W&L each sets its own
course in the pursuit of excellence
in higher education. At times, how-
ever, this goal is more readily ob-
tained through cooperative efforts.

‘To Build for the Future

Alumni Will Have An Opportunity
To Acquire Souvenir Nails from Lee Chapel

S THE COLONNADE is symbolic
A of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity as a place, then’ the Lee
Chapel is symbolic of the University
in a spiritual sense.

Students spend more time in
other buildings on the campus, but
the hours spent in Lee Chapel are
memorable ones. ‘They are associ-
ated with a student’s coming to
Washington and Lee—the orienta-
tion lectures and other freshman
assemblies; and they are associated
with his leaving—the quiet dignity
of the baccalaureate or commence-
ment ceremony which all graduates
remember.

And, always, there is the affinity
which each alumnus feels for Lee
Chapel because this small, simple
building symbolizes those qualities
of honor and gentlemanly conduct
which are as fundamental to the
Washington and Lee man as are
the bricks and hand-forged nails
which help shape the Chapel.

The work toward restoring and
preserving Lee Chapel is now well

FALL, 1962

underway. One step to assure the
permanence of the Chapel involved
replacing the wooden beams and
trusses of the roof with steel. Many
of the spikes and nails which were
used in the original construction
are unsuitable for re-use, and a
large number of these historic items
have been collected and saved.

It was recognized immediately
that many persons would lke to
have a nail from Lee Chapel as a

 

nearly century-old memento of the
University’s past. And it was ac-
knowledged at once that no one
likely would be more interested

in acquiring such a nail than would
an alumnus.

‘The University proceeded to give
to the Alumni Association the ac-
cumulation of nails, to be distrib-
uted among alumni by whatever
means decided upon by the Asso-
ciation’s officers. Some kind of co-
ordination with the Alumni Fund
was an obvious possibility.

In examining the Lee Chapel
nails, it is easy to draw an analogy
between the sturdy iron pegs whch
helped support and continue to
support Lee Chapel and the solid,
dependable and loyal alumni whose
annual contributions to the Alum-
ni Fund support the University
in such an important way. The
sizes Of the nails and spikes vary,
just as the sizes of the annual gifts
from alumni vary, but all are sig-
nificant in themselves and all con-
tribute to an important end _ re-
sult.

There are not enough of the
Lee Chapel nails available to send
one to every alumnus. The criteria

35

 

 

for distribution will be a matter for
decision at the next Alumni Fund
Council meeting. It seems likely
that the nails can play an import-
ant part in furthering two vital as-
pects of the 1962-63 Fund Cam-
paign.

One vital necessity for the suc-
cess of the Fund this year is the
broadening of the base of giving:
that is, getting more and more
alumni to participate as contrib-
utors. ‘The Fund Council has set
its sights high: 100 per cent par-
ticipation from the University’s
11,000 alumni.

Another vital factor for success
is the need for all regular contrib-
utors to “raise their sights” in 1962-
63: that is, increase the amount of
their gifts in accordance with their
means. ‘This alone would assure the
attainment of the goal of $115,000
sought this year.

It follows, then, that perhaps the
nails might be given to those alum-
ni who participate in the Alumni
Fund for the first time during 1962-
63, as well as to all regular givers,
with special appreciation to those
whose contributions to the 1962-68
Fund show increases over their gifts
in 1961-62. ‘The Alumni Secretary
is currently investigating economi-
cal but attractive ways by which the
nails might be mounted as keep-
sakes for Alumni Fund contribu-
tors. The next issue of the Alumni
Magazine will carry a full report
on how this will be done.

In the meantime, won’t you con-
sider the importance of your gift
to the Alumni Fund? ‘Together,
thousands of strong, single nails
have given shape and form to Lee
Chapel for nearly a century. To-
gether, the thousands of thoughtful
individual gifts from alumni _ rep-
resent for your University the in-
come on several millions of dollars,
and help give substance and di-
rection to its course today and in
the future. Give now to the 1962-63

 

The exposed wooden beams of Lee Chapel cast a strange pattern of shadows as workmen .
prepare to replace them with sturdier steel members. Alumni Fund.

“Matching Gift’? Plans---
Does Your Firm Have One?

NCREASING NUMBERS of American
I companies are joining in a rela-
tively new aid-to-education plan
that is directly related to the sup-
port which their employees give
to higher education as alumni of
the nation’s colleges and univer-
sities.

‘The format is basically a ‘“‘match-
ing gift” plan. Individual compan-
ies may vary in the operating de-
tails of their programs, but all are
essentially alike in that they
match—usually dollar for dollar—
the contributions of an alumnus-
employee to his college or univer-
sity.

As of August 15, 1962, the Am-
erican Alumni Council reported

that 186 companies are currently
conducting “matching gift” pro-
grams. ‘The Council pointed out
that the number of participating
companies is steadily increasing, so
there is the likelihood that the list
printed in this issue has grown since
August. The Travelers Insurance
Companies began a matching gift
program as of October 1, to cite one
example.

During recent years, Washington
and Lee has shared in the benefits
of the maching gifts plans of vari-
ous companies who employ Wash-
ington and Lee men. Alumni have
found the matching gift of their
employer tantamount to doubling
their contribution to the annual

 

Alumni Fund. In the Alumni Fund
records, the alumnus is credited
with both his contribution and his
company’s.

If the company you work for is
listed, be sure to notify your em-
ployer when you make your annual
or capital gift to Washington and
Lee. Your employer probably has
a simple short form available to
speed the process. It’s as simple as
two plus two equals four.

If the company you work for is
not listed, please check with the
proper person in your organization
who might be influential in getting
such a program started. Show him
this article and the list of firms who
do have one. In this case, you would
be helping not only Washington
and Lee but all colleges and univer-
sities as well. Frequently a company
wants to help support higher edu-
cation but has not yet decided how
to get started. ‘The matching gift
approach may be an answer.
