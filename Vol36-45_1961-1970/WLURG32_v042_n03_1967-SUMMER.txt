R. FRED CARRINGTON COLE'S ce-
ie cision to leave the presidency
of Washington and Lee University
to become president of the Council
on Library Resources, Inc., evoked
an outpouring of regret on and ofl
the campus. But this lament was
the preface to acclaim of him as
an effective educational administra-
tor and as a good and true man.

A resolution adopted unani-
mously by the faculty said: “It is
not too much to say that, because
of the progressive attitude which
has marked his eight-year tenure
in the presidency, Washington and
Lee has been brought to a new
awareness of the distinctive contri-
butions it can make to higher edu-

cation. He leaves Washington and
Lee with the potential and cap-
ability of maintaining and expand-
ing its position of prestige and
respect among the nation’s aca-
demic community.”

The Executive Committee of the
Student Body, in a resolution ol
appreciation and respect, said:

“We congratulate the Board ol
Trustees on their action in bring-
ing Dr. Cole to Washington and
Lee eight years ago, and we only
hope that they may find a succes-
sor as knowledgeable in the field of
higher education, as capable in
University administration, and as
farsighted in his ideas as he.”

An editorial in the Roanoke

A visitor’s view of PRESIDENT COLE in his office.

Times noted that “the period of
Dr. Cole’s tenure has not been a
placid one at the 218-year-old uni-
versity over which Robert E. Lee
once presided,” but that he “was
equal to the task” and made “‘last-
ing contributions.”

Said the New-Gazette of Lexing-
ton: “Dr. Cole’s term at the college
has spanned what might be called
a period of transition. Attitudes
have been changing rapidly, especi-
ally among the young people. In-
tegration has played its part, par-
ticularly in the educational world.
He has met the problems arising
from these developments squarely,
with moderation but with firmness
and dignity...It is not given to
many men to have the impact on an
institution that Dr. Cole has had
on Washington and Lee in so short
a time. His place will be difficult
indeed to fill. But as expresssed by
one of his colleagues, the University
has been fortunate to have him this
long.”

The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk
said, “Virginia is gratified at having

4

 

benefited from his energies and vis-
ion.” And Norfolk’s Ledger-Star,
after summarizing Dr. Cole’s aca-
demic career and contributions to
education at Washington and Lee
and elsewhere, said, “And though
Virginia’s intellectual community
suffers through Dr. Cole’s depar-
ture, there is no doubt that educa-
tion, whose roots are in the nation’s
libraries, will benefit as a whole.”

Dr. Cole’s personality, tempera-
ment and style came in for com-
ment. “Quiet and unobtrusive,”
said the faculty resolution. The
Virginian-Pilot spoke of “his calm,
wise counsel” and called him a
“man of quiet, understatement.”
Many persons who know him inti-
mately refer to him as “basically a
shy man.”’ All attest to his courtesy
and fair-mindness, and many know
that he can be incisive and em-
phatic about matters that mean
much to him and to education.

At Washington and Lee, he ex:
hibited little of the flair for dra-
matics that sometimes marked the

‘Throughout all this, no one was
more assiduous than Dr. Cole in
insisting upon the preservation of
the traditions that have made
Washington and Lee distinctive as
a place where gentlemen teach
gentlemen. He once put his philo-
sophy this way:

“There is a vital place for schools
that put a premium on honor and
integrity, for schools where time-
tested student tradition—not rigid
university policy—has given under-
graduates an Opportunity to dis-

tinguish themselves from current
student attitudes in some places in
matters of honor, courtesy, appear-
ance and responsibility.”

Dr. Cole’s influence and counsel
extended beyond the Washington
and Lee campus, and his “extra-
curricular” activities brought credit
to the University.

He was for three years president
of the Virginia Foundation for In-
dependent Colleges, an organiza-
tion which annually attracts funds
for private colleges from business
and industry. And for a time he
was chairman of the Board of
‘Trustees of the College Entrance
Examination Board. He is chair-
man of the Department of the
Army's Historical Advisory Com-
mittee, chairman of the Advisory
Council on Research of the Office of
Education, a trustee of the George
C. Marshall Foundation, a member
of the board of the Ford Motor

He worked as a trustee establish-

School Association, a move backed
by federal and private grants that
succeeded in reopening the county’s
public schools.

Dr. Cole is a historian. He came
to Washington and Lee in 1959
from Tulane University, where he
Was successively an associate profes-
sor and professor of history, dean
of the college of arts and sciences,
and academic vice president. At
Tulane he played a large role in
the upgrading of that university
through a large-scale building and
educational program.

He is a native of Franklin, Texas.
He received his A.B., M.A., and
Ph. D. degrees from Louisiana State
University, where he was an editor
of the Journal of Southern History,
of the Southern Biography Series,
and of the Louisiana State Univer-
sity Press. And from 1946 to 1953,
he was associate editor of the Mis-
sissippt Valley Historical Review.

During World War II, he was a
gunnery officer in the Navy and
saw extensive sea duty before under-
taking the editorial revision of the
Navy's Manual of the Medical De-
partment, tor which he received a

Navy's surgeon general.

While he was still at Tulane, he

was one ol two administrative viee
presidents to Vice President Me
Peak, whose responsibility was

tion. From this work sprang a three
fold program: one of $260 million
lor faculty salaries, one of $20 mike
lion to create the national merit
scholarship program, and one of
$5 million to initiate the Cound
on Library Resources, Inc., whose
purpose was to develop new library
methods and techniques. In 1960;
the foundation awarded a sustaile
ing grant of $8 million for the
Council’s continuing support. Di
Cole has been a member of i6
board of directors since 1962.

Thus when Dr. Cole succeeded
Verner W. Clapp as Council presé
dent on September 1 he became
head of an agency he had a major
role in creating.

Whitney North Seymour, in a
nouncing Dr. Cole’s election said:
“Dr. Cole is an academic admin
strator of great experience af i

he served as a full-time consulta

art in many important decisions
that have affected American educa-
tion. He was one of the first to
realize that the Ford Foundation
had a significant role to play in
scientific research as applied to the
development of libraries. As an
academic administrator he under-
stands the complex problems facing
research libraries today. The Coun-
cilon Library Research regards him
as an ideal man to lead in the
attack on these problems.”

Dr. and Mrs. Cole moved to
Washington, D. C. in late summer.
They are the parents of a daughter
and three sons: Miss Caroline Cole,

Resolution

President

Cole

Adopted

By the Faculty
And Sealed
By a Standing

Ovation

The resignation of Dr. Fred
C. Cole, president of Washing-
ton and Lee University since
1959, having been announced to
the faculty on May 22 and to the
public shortly thereafter, the
faculty of Washington and Lee
wishes to place upon record its
sense of profound regret, and its
appreciation of the policies and
programs which have been real-
ized under his leadership.

During his years on_ this
campus President Cole in his
own quiet and unobtrusive style
has achieved an impressive list
of what the Roanoke Times edi-
torial of May 24, 1967, aptly
characterized as “lasting contri-
butions.” These will readily
come to mind, especially to those
faculty members who have served
throughout Dr. Cole’s period in
office. A glance about the campus
reveals the $1.5 million New
Science facilities which were
planned under Dr. Cole’s guid-

 

ance, and equipped throw
matching federal grants
possible by his interest and §
port, the rebuilding of Reid
for the use of the Departmen
Journalism and Commu
tions, a new University Ri
Station, the installation 6
modern Electronic Lang
Laboratory, the renovation ¢
campus residence as a hands
Alumni House, the construct
of new dormitories, and a t
fully restored Lee Chapel,
last-named made possible by
$370,000 grant from the Fé
Motor Company Fund.
Outstanding features of
Cole’s presidency have been
stantial increases in faculty $
aries, encouragement of fact
research, additions to the fae
and curriculum, and reorganl
tion of the administrative sta
President Cole’s awareness of E
American academic picture, é
his sympathetic understandl

departmental needs have been

eat assistance in recruitment
f faculty, @s heads of depart-
ents can attest. Last December
r rant of $250,000 by the Alfred
Sloan | ‘coundation of New
york to Washington and Lee (in
company with grants to twenty
of Amer ica’s leading colleges
and universities) was announced
ip provide for the strengthening

i the science program.

The importance of a modern
computer and data processing
center Was recognized early in
pr. Cole's administration. This
facility has made possible mod-
ern techniques of analysis in the
gcial scicnces, commerce, the
natural sciences and has im-
mensely improved the admini-
svative procedures of the uni-
versity.

President Cole’s concern for
the welfare of students is shown
by the actions he has taken in
tripling financial aid to students,
in completing plans for a new
student union, and in establish-
ing a campus bookstore. His
imaginative and _ constructive
leadership is clearly demonstrat-
ed by his establishment of the
Robert E. Lee Undergraduate
Research Participation —Pro-
gram, an innovation which has
subsequently been adopted
throughout the nation. Relating
to another important facet of
student life, the faculty strongly
commends the program of non-
subsidized athletics, brought to
such successful operation at
Washington and Lee in the past
eight years.

In other significant areas, the
laculty desires to record its
‘taunch endorsement of basic ad-
Missions policy decisions recently
adopted by the Board of Trus-
‘ees and implemented by the ad-
Ministration, which places Wash-
ington and Lee in line with the
verwhelming majority of reput-

SUMMER 1967

able institutions of higher learn-
ing in this nation. President
Cole’s firm championship of free-
dom of expression on_ this
campus is by no means the least
of his contributions.

For these and other accomp-
lishments the faculty wishes to
affirm its gratitude. It is not too
much to say that, because of the
progressive attitude which has
marked his 8-year tenure in the
presidency, Washington and Lee
has been brought to a new aware-
ness of the distinctive contribu-
tions it can make to higher edu-

cation. He leaves Washington
and Lee with the potential and
capability of maintaining and
expanding its position of pres-
tige and respect among the na-
tion’s academic community.
The faculty wishes President
Cole success in his new work,
which we are happy to note will
be in a significant educational
field. President and Mrs. Cole
carry with them our thanks for
all they have done for Washing-
ton and Lee, and our best wishes
always for happiness, health, and
prosperity in the years ahead.

Students Join the Praise
And Express a Hope

We, the members of the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the Stu-
dent Body, express our sincere
regret at the resignation of Presi-
dent Fred C. Cole, and our deep
appreciation for his outstanding
service to the University during
the past eight years.

Dr. Cole has proven himself
a farsighted and extremely cap-
able administrator, and _ has
achieved, despite considerable
obstacles, a significant record of
progress in solving the problems
of Washington and Lee. The
great improvement of the science
departments, the maintenance of
competitive faculty salaries in a
rapidly rising market, the intro-
duction of undergraduate re-
search programs, and the exten-
sive capital improvements under-
taken during the past few years
have seriously taxed the financial
resources of Washington and
Lee. Yet Dr. Cole has met each
of these needs despite disappoint-
ing support from those sources
which would normally be ex-

pected to take an active role in
providing funds.

The long-delayed integration
of the University was accomp-
lished through Dr. Cole’s presis-
tence and integrity in overcom-
ing great resistance and_ the
creative concept of “Lee College”
demonstrated the breadth of his
vision for the future of Wash-
ington and Lee.

We congratulate the Board of
Trustees on their action in bring-
ing Dr. Cole to Washington and
Lee eight years ago, and we only
hope that they may find a suc-
cessor as knowledgeable in the
field of higher education, as
capable in University admini-
stration, and as farsighted in his
ideas as he. To Dr. Cole we
express our gratitude for his co-
operation with the Executive
Committee of the Student Body,
and his active interest in our
efforts. We sincerely hope that
he may find satisfaction in his
new position.

OMMENCEMENT Is a hoary ritual.

And to the hundreds of people
gathered in the shade of the big
hardwoods on the front campus on
the sunny morning of June Q,
Washington and Lee’s 1967 finals
program may have seemed like any
other.

It was and it wasn’t.

 

The order of the exercises was
the same. The organ played. The
faculty and the graduating seniors
marched in stately procession
through Washington Hall, along
the Colonnade, and down the curv-
ing path to the rostrum decked in
greenery and to the rows of chairs
before it. Mothers and _ fathers,
brothers and _ sisters, aunts and
uncles, and girl friends of the grad-
uates craned for a better view or
lined the paths to take pictures.

Certainly, it was different for
President Fred C. Cole. It was his
last commencement at the Uni-
versity over which he had presided
for eight years. And if during the
singing of “College Friendships,”
his eyes became misty, who would

 

deny him sentiment at such a mo-

There were other items that set
this commencement apart.

lt was a particularly special day
lor Philander (Phil) Priestley Clax-
‘on, Ill, of Washington, D.C. and
his lamliy. He was a “double grad-
late.”” He carried twice the normal
load during much of his time at
Washington and Lee and earned
‘wo deorees. He received first from
the hand of President Cole the B.S.

commerce, cum laude. Then he re-
turned to the line and received a
B.A. degree in economics.

It was more than a special day,
too, for Alan Gary Cohen of Pu-
laski, Tenn., and his family. He
was valedictorian, which gave him
the privilege of addressing the com-
mencement assemblage. His aca-
demic average was close to a
straight-A. He will study medicine.

And for Garry Apgar of Barring-
ton, Ill., it was a day to remember
for sure. All year, his Feiffer-like
cartoons had appeared in the Ring-
tum Phi, picking and poking at
this and that, mostly faculty mem-
bers. One of his last showed Presi-
dent Cole agonizing over what to
say at graduation. Was the Presi-

Days of chill rain preceded Com-

Service, the day before, was trans-
ferred from Evans Dining Hall to
Doremus Gymnasium because of
the threat of rain. This was done
so that the luncheon sponsored by
the Alumni Association originally
scheduled to be held on the lawn,
could be held in the dining hall.

But the rain held off as Dr. David
W. Sprunt, chaplain and _ professor
of religion, delivered the Baccalau-
reate sermon. “The heart of Bibli-
cal faith,” he said, “is not to be
found in idealism, nor in creed,
nor in a code, nor in a ceremony.

a Marine commission.

The sun was still bright by
the time the academic procession
started at 11 a.m. An estimated
1,700 people were present.

Dean C. P. Light, Jr., presented
16 candidates for the LL.B. degree,

First, the speech.

Y CONFERRING honorary degrees
i our distinguished guests on
this platform the University has
sought to recognize the outstanding
achievements of these gentlemen
and their great service to mankind.
By conferring baccalaureate degrees
upon you graduates Washington
and Lee recognizes your accomplish-
ments as students and, of greater
significance, affirms the great prom-
ise each of you possesses for impor-
tant contributions to the common
good of all people. I congratulate
you again most sincerely.

A few days ago there appeared
in the student newspaper by a
talented young gentleman in the
audience a cartoon depicting me in
the throes of beginning to think of
preparing my remarks for this occa-
sion. I was, at first, slighlty piqued
because I felt that the artist had
treated me somewhat unfairly. I
did not believe that I had as many
chins as were shown. Then I looked
in the mirror. The young man had
been kinder than I deserved. He
suggested in his cartoon “balloons”
that I was reviewing what I had
said in the past. He decided for me
that since you had not been here
for long it would be an opportune
time to “dish back” (his words) at
this class what I may have said be-
fore perhaps on “The Firm Foun-
dation” bit. I have given much
thought to this suggestion and
others he made. An education from
Washington and Lee is indeed a
“firm foundation.” And if my re-
marks to the 1967 graduates need

I have spoken of the alumni of
Washington and Lee who enjoy
positions of influence far out of
proportion to their numbers, and
of our justifiable pride in the con-

I have from time to time in my
years here talked about matters of
current importance to this Uni-
versity and to higher education gen-
erally. Let me note briefly another
such topic—not the most important
one facing us today but important
nevertheless.

among many educators about re-
forms that should be made in the
large universities to make them
more tractable for effective educa-

to develop conditions that prey
upon this campus now: high fa

and humanists and social scienti

students and faculty; a gene
concern for the individual stue

highly-coveted conditions that

and its tax support.

Some educators have become
preoccupied with the problems
growing bigger that they have e&
cluded that it is virtually imp
sible for their institutions to ex

tively small. The warning is hea
that the relatively small colleg

Tactfully, the leaders of the good,

suggest that some of the answers to
the larger universities’ problems
might be found at places like Wil-
liams, \mherst, Davidson, Sewanee,
and Washington and Lee. It may
not be too late for large universi-

could exist entirely apart from the
undergraduate schools, rather than
in the customary relationship that
all too often works to the under-
graduates’ disadvantage. Perhaps
some of the problems of the gradu-
ate and professional schools today
could be solved if the undergrad-
uate faculties, such as the one here,
were consulted both in terms of
What is to be taught and who
Should be taught.

My purpose in mentioning this
how is to underscore for you, the
graduates, how fortunate you are
in my opinion to have earned your
degrees at Washington and Lee.
This University has its problems
aS lo all schools, but these problems
dre not insoluble. There should be,
Of course, continuous thought on
the part of students, faculty, and

SUMMER 1967

alumni alike as to the direction
Washington and Lee will follow in
the years ahead. There must be
concern about this University’s obli-
gation to help educate more of the
highly qualified students who wish
to come here. There must be a
continuous self-evaluation. A good
beginning in these regrads has been
made and I am certain improve-
ments will result.

Last November, at the conclusion
of a self-study period of over two
years at this University professors
and administrators from ten other
universities and colleges visited the
campus in order to review our re-
port and to submit their findings
to the Southern Association of Col-
leges and Schools. A portion of the
report of this Visiting Committee
was addressed to the President of
this University. I believe that it in-
dicates the significance, beyond the
campus, of the work that is done by
Washington and Lee, and I should
like to read from that statement:

“We felt that it was our central
responsibility to bring a creative
and objective intelligence to the
University to look at much that
may have become dimmed to the
eyes of the native by close famili-
arity and long association. We hope
also that we were able to bring a
richly varied experience from other
institutions that share Washington
and Lee’s high regard for excellence
even as we pursue it in different
ways. We believe we have at no
point attempted to impose our pri-
vate views upon an institution that

 

Then, relaxation.

is itself proud of its own distinction.
We have not hesitated, however, to
report or recommend measures that
in our corporate opinion would im-
prove the University in any of its
programs. An institution of Wash-
ington and Lee’s prestige in the aca-
demic community has an obligation
to all of us, as well as to itself, to be
as superior in every fact as it is in
reputation.”

When Dr. Nathan Pusey, presi-
dent of Harvard, spoke at my inau-
guration here he reviewed the basic
strengths of an institution such as
“What makes a_ college
good,”’ he summarized, “‘is its magic
power, perennially renewed, to
widen experience, and in so doing,
to work those transformations, even
exaltations, in young minds and
hearts, indeed in all of us, drawing
us into fuller and deeper life...”

My experience here has proven
to me this is a “good college.”

yours.

[ hope you will take with you a
keen awareness of the privilege that
has been yours in your years at
Washington and Lee. We _ thank
you for all you have been—for all
you have done for Washington and
Lee. I wish each of you much suc-
cess.

I, too, shall treasure the great
honor and privilege and oppor-
tunity that were mine to know
you and to work with your dis-
tinguished faculty and to make
what contribution I could to this
University. I hope it will always
merit your loyalty and affection as
it will mine.

now, even the most daring political
prognosticator is unwilling to say.
The public opinion polls at this
stage are little help. Certainly, the
candidates themselves don’t know.
Even their wives are in the dark.

So Washington and Lee students
have their work cut out for them.
They will spend the next eight
months trying to pin down the
answer to one of 1968's big po-

the Republican nomination? The
odds are very good that their
answer will be correct.

End of 15-Year ‘Press Run’, Maybe

By John E. Hughes

OST TEACHERS are dedicated;
however few would drive 70,-
000 miles just to teach one class.

But that is just what William G.
(Bill) Leverty has done. Every
spring, Leverty makes his weekly
trip by car from Richmond, where
he is a fulltime assistant managing
editor of the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch, to Lexington, where he is
a visiting lecturer to journalism
students at Washington and Lee
University. It’s a 300-mile journey,
round-trip. And he does it on his
days off.

He’s been doing it since 1953,
hence the estimated 70,000 addi-
tional miles he has put on his car
in that span.

As Leverty describes it, “ For 15
years I’ve watched the snow recede
and the dogwood blossom, as I
come through the Blue Ridge
mountains.”

He’s also driven it more than
once in a blizzard, and once ran off
the road into a snowbank. On one

University’s Office of Information Services
and is a frequent contributor to the
Alumni Magazine.

is

such occasion the normal three-
hour trip took 7%.

“I was afraid to stop,” Leverty
explained.

This past spring marked Bill's
finale as a visiting lecturer, or so
he says. He plans to “retire” as a
teacher although he'll still be a full-
time editor on the Times-Dispatch.

As a visiting lecturer, Leverty
teaches a course in newspaper edit-
ing, make-up, typography and head-
line writing. He prefers an informal
approach to teaching, and thus
gathers his students around a news-
paper-style “copy desk’’ or rim.
For teaching aids he uses actual
newspaper copy and pictures he has
accumulated during the week as
front page makeup man for the
T-D.

The students are free—indeed are
encouraged—to interrupt him at
any time with questions.

I've always tried to make them
ask questions,’ Leverty remarked
‘There must be thousands of them
they want to ask.

“It’s different when you have a
working newspaperman teaching
one day a week. It’s entirely dif-
ferent from teaching out of a book.
In the newspaper business, you
learn by making mistakes.”

1967: The Generals Seek Pay Dirt

O PUT IT IN A NUTSHELL, Wash-
on and Lee’s football team
is looking for a little prosperity.
Not since the 1963 season, when the
Generals finished 5-3-0, have head
coach Lee McLaughlin’s forces been
able to assemble a winner. And in
the span dating back to the 1964
Campaign, W&L has put together
an over-all (1964:
45-0; 1965: 3-6-0; and 1966: 2-5-2).

g-16-2 record

lf McLaughlin rescues his slump-
Ng Generals this fall, he’ll do it
With a sizeable crew of sharp look-

<a

Le.

SUMMER 1967

ing sophomores, an improved effort
from the offensive line, and a good
showing from _ five—that’s right
five— quarterbacks.

The latter factor is probably the
element

blessing McLaughlin’s team. Senior

most important — single
Andy Bloom, who experienced a
difficult, if not dismal, 1966 season,
should be hitting again with his
bullet-like short tosses and floating
long-rangers. He should easily sur-
pass the 7o2 yards he netted last
year when he had poor blocking
and inadequate receivers.

Junior Alan ‘Tomlin, a smallish-
type field commander who is back
with W&L after a year’s layoff, is

McLaughlin’s No. 2 quarterback
choice. At 5-9 and 165 pounds,
Tomlin drew praise from all quart-
ers during the Generals’ spring
drills last February, so it could be
that his eagerness to play football
again will inspire him right into
a starting assignment sooner than
most realize.

Depth is provided by three sopho-
mores—Jack Baizley, Jay Dorman,
and Chuck Kuhn. They're all cap-
able signal-callers, but most likely
they will be stationed in the de-
fensive secondary in order to utilize
their talents. As McLaughlin puts
it: “They're just too good to keep
on the bench.”

So, at last, it looks as though
W&L will be able to find someone
to charge up its offense, and with
that come touchdowns and winning
games. At least, the Generals appear
ready to have a go at it.
and Tomlin have the equipment,

Bloom

as do the three sophomores, and
there is comparable talent found
elsewhere.

Numbers alone show that. Only
seven players have graduated, leav-
ing 13 seniors, 22 juniors, and 91
sophomores. Additionally, Mc-
Laughlin probably will weed out
a few freshmen for varsity play
from the 35 to 40 expected new-
comers. Thirty lettermen will be
available.

The performer to watch out of
all that group will be junior line-
backer John Wolf, perhaps an even
better defensive player than was
Tiny Terry Fohs. Wolf has only
one philosophy about the game of
football, and that is to hit. He
averaged close to 10 unassisted
tackles per game last season, help-
ing in six others each contest. No
doubt, he’s genuine Little All-
America prospect if he can get some
assistance from his teammates in
starting a comeback effort.

If not, then Wolf goes unnoticed
and McLaughlin’s team absorbs a
few more lumps.

Everybody's getting tired of that.

RESHMAN MEL CARTWRIGHT was
Paes responsible for the
abundant success this year of the
basketball
Generals, but three other first-year
players—Mal Wesselink, Norwood
Morrison, and Stuart Fauber—were

Washington and Lee

key figures, too.
Sophomore John Carrere fin-
ished with an 11.7 average as a
guard, while injured classmate Rob
Bauer still managed to hit for an
8.g mark even though playing less
than 10 minutes a game.
Center Earl Edwards
through with some timely shooting,

came

and senior ‘Tommy Cox, almost for-
gotten in the pre-season notices
that raved of something new in
Lexington, put on some defensive
exhibitions that would have ri-
valed a thief in an open-air mar-
ket.

Such was the tenor of Washing-
ton and Lee University’s basket-
ball Generals this season, a team
that:

—Completed the first winning
campaign at W&L in 10 years, end-
ing with a 20-5 record, the second
time in history a score of victories
had been posted (the last came
during the 1956-57 session when
the Generals finished 20-7).

—Won the College Athletic Con-
ference championship (held in Lex-
ington in late February) by taking
a 58-55 overtime victory over de-
fending champion Sewanee in the
semi-finals, then breezing to a 75-59
win over Southwestern of Memphis
for the title.

—Received feelers from the reg-
ional NCAA selection committee
concerning a possible at-large berth
for the small college play-offs in
Evansville, Ind. (Stetson of Florida,
however, got the bid and eventual-
ly wound up losing to nationally-
ranked Kentucky Wesleyan.)

—Was listed among the nation’s
small college defensive leaders
.throughout the second half of the
season. Washington and Lee’s year-
end 66.2 average placed the Gen-

CoAcH VERNE CANFIELD exhorts his players to new heights.

“The Basketball Program’

Canfield’s Boys Deliver

erals 29th in the country.
—Placed Cartwright and Wesselink
on the All-Virginia team, put
Cartwright on the honorable men-
tion list of the Little All-America
squad, and received one Virginia
sportswriter’s acclaim as the “Team
of the Year.”

Some of the highlights of the
schedule included eight-, five-, and
four-game winning streaks, the lat-
ter which will be carried into next
year; a 77-26 victory over St. An-
drews of North Carolina, which
was instrumental in putting W&L
on the NCAA defensive list; and a
94-75 rout of Old Dominion, at
that time the state’s top small col-
lege team.

Canfield’s Reconstruction

It would be a mistaken notion
to believe that what happened this
past season just happened. “The
Basketball Program,” as head coach
Verne Canfield likes to call it, is a
painstaking organized effort to re-

build the basketball fortunes
WL.

Not only does it cover the ru
mentary details of practice, scot
ing reports, recruiting trips,
game plans, but also a gamut
other, more obscure elements—st
dent assistants who are willing
type letters and do other mundé
work, the presentation of a
on a player's birthday, and
availability of a freshman nam
‘Tom Dawson, who’s got to be
most gung-ho manager ever S€
in these parts. |

That “Program” has paid off
reaping quantities, to such an €
tent that a once-apathetic camp
is behind the effort in numbe
never before imagined. During
Friday and Saturday night C?
tournament games, over 1,000 pe

Me. CARTWRIGHT at the free-throw line, his mask no bother.

Cartwright’s Contribution
s

Through it all, no other player
generated as much excitement as
Cartwright did time and again. He
scored 32 points one night, 29 on
two other occasions, 27 in his first
game as a college player on Dec.
1 against Bridgewater.

His forte was a baseline drive that
left defenders numb and _ shaking
their heads in consternation, and
that was one reason he averaged
20.1 points a game. He was the
team’s top rebounder, and led in
assists, too.

The only time he was stopped
cold came on Feb. 16 against Old
Dominion. Late in the game, he
and Norwood Morrison went after
arebound, but the only thing Cart-
wright got was Morrison’s elbow
on the nose. Result: Cartwright
suffered a fracture that was later
lo require a post-season operation.
In the interim, he wore a protective
mask that didn’t seem to bother
him at all.

In fact, nothing seemed to both-
er Cartwright and his teammates
this year. The Generals were a
loose bunch, confident of their abil-
ities and determined to put W&L
back on the road to basketball
respectability.

And that’s just exactly what they

did.

SUMMER 1967

Tennis Championship

The fast-rising Verne Canfield
again was the man of the hour, as
last spring his Washington and Lee
tennis team completely swept aside
all opposition to take yet another
College Athletic Conference title
for the University.

You had to be in Memphis, the
site of the CAC’s Spring Sports Fes-
tival, to believe it. Drawing seeds
at every position because of their
fine 8-3 regular-season record, the
Generals sent all six singles per-
formers into the finals, then did
the same thing with their three
doubles teams.

That, quite naturally, was a first
in the five-year history of the con-
ference.

Washington and Lee eventually

ended up with three singles cham-
pions—sophomore Ray Turman at
the No. 2 spot, senior captain Phil
Thompson at No. 4, and freshman
Tom McJunkin at No. 6—while
Turman and sophomore ‘Tommy
Rueger gave the Generals the No.
1 doubles title.

By winning the CAC tennis com-
petition with a record-breaking 40
points, the W&L players presented
their coach his second league cham-
pionship in the same year.

That, also quite naturally, was
another first in the five-year history
of the conference.

Elsewhere at the Spring Sports
Festival, the Generals could do no
good. Head coach Joe Lyles’ base-
ball team was defeated by Sewanee,
6-g, and Washington University
14-0, to finish last among the five
tournament entries. Some consola-
tion was gained, though, when
captain and first baseman Eric Sis-
ler was named to the All-Confer-
ence team.

Head Coach Norm Lord's ‘Track
squad also finished last, its 22
points far behind Southwestern’s
94 total. Junior Corbett Bryant's
second-place finish in the three-
mile run was the best W&L could
manage.

The Generals’ golf team, under
head coach Cy Twombly, came in
fourth with a 36-hole 624 total, 19
shots behind champion Southwest-
ern. Sophomore Bill McLeed’s 80o-
“8 performances were W&L’s best.

1966-67 Alumni Fund Contributor;

HE 1966-67 ALUMNI FUND was the best in recent
Dea in dollars donated, best in the number
of alumni solicited, best in the number of contributors,
best in the percentage of donors, and best in the
average gilt.

Best of all, the fund’s performance was encourag-

  
  
 
 

The Alumni Fund Council, headed by William
Wisdom, ’21 of New Orleans, La., was responsible
conducting the campaign. Other members of the Ce

better results in the years ahead.

Contributions totaled $210,655.88. This was $31,-
433-28 more than last year. And it was the first time

that the fund exceeded the $200,000 level.

Appeals went to 11,528 alumni compared to 11,194
last year. Contributions numbered 4,186, an increase
of 492 over last year. There were 299 alumni who
gave for the first time. The percentage of donors rose

from 32.99 to 36.31. The average gift increased from

$48.51 to $50.32
