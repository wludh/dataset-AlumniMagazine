HIS TIME It was dciflerent.

tors came to the Washington and

ho

rHE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

Cole and Frank Parsons, assistant
io the president for institutional re-
search, joined the board for a sum-
mary meeting on the third day, the
board said, in effect, “This has been
good; we should do it again; and
other groups should do the same.”

It was decided then and there
that Executive Secretary William C.
Washburn should work with Uni-
versity officials to arrange similar
programs to which other alumni—
perhaps chapter presidents or class
agents—would be invited, either in
the Spring or next Fall.

More than that. The directors
adopted a statement for distribu-
tion to all alumni. A key paragraph
noted “a spirit of alertness and op-
enmindedness” at Washington and
Lee, “a willingness to question and
experiment, and a vigorous dedica-
tion to standards of excellence. Lhe
University appears to be alive and
on the move.”

(The full text of the statement
accompanies this article.)

The meeting was arranged to
give the Alumni Board an in-depth
understanding of the University to-
day. A specific aim was to foster
more effective alumni interest, par-
ticipation, and sharing in the pro-
gress of the University. This aim
was largely accomplished in a ques-
ting atmosphere. It was a meaning-
ful dialogue between the men re-
sponsible for running the Univer-
sity in a time of great educational
ferment and the men_ representa-
tive of what the University has ac-
complished and of those who must
sustain her.

All of the twelve members of the
Alumni Board were present except
Thomas C. Frost, Jr., of San Anton-
io, Texas, who was out of the coun-
try on business. The presence of so
many directors was in itself special
and gave weight to the board's re-

sponses and recommendations.

PRor. NORMAN F. Lorp talks about money,
ivy, and athletics.

FALL-WINTER 1967

Francis W. Plowman, Alumni
Board president, presided at the

formal board sessions.

At the business meeting, the
board favored the coordination of
all University fund raising activi-
ties, including the annual alumni
giving program, by a new office of
University Development.

This action amended the board's
position adopted at the May meet-
ing. At that time the board favored
adding an experienced assistant
to the alumni office staff to conduct
the annual giving program.

The board’s new position was
based on President Cole’s review
of the University’s plans tor creat-
ing and staffing a permanent Ofhce
of University Development.

President Cole reported that the
matter had been studied as part ol
the University’s recent Self-Study
and that advice had been obtained
from an outside consulting firm. He
said the generally accepted and
most effective organization for fund
raising in colleges and universities
is to have all such activities, in-
cluding alumni giving, coordinat-
ed by one central ofhie.

President Cole reviewed plans to
name a director of development
who would be assisted by an asso-
ciate director whose primary re-
sponsibility would be direction olf
the annual Alumni Fund, in coop-
eration with Alumni Secretary
Washburn and the Alumni Fund
Council.

The board recommended that
the University Board of Trustees
appraise the several federal loan
and grant programs that may be
available to help improve or ex-
pand the University’s buildings and
facilities.

This action followed Dr. Cole's
discussion with the directors of the
physical needs of the University
and the question of federal aid pro-
grams relating to these and other
needs.

The Alumni Board endorsed the
President’s comments on the need
for physical improvements and ex-
pansion and suggested that an ap-
praisal of possible federal aid be
made at the earliest practical time.
This work is now in progress.

The board also recommended
that the University Board of ‘Trus-

 

 

 

A STATEMENT

by

‘The Alumni Board of Directors

HE ALUMNI BOARD OF DIRECTORS participated in a three-day program on the
ft: campus designed to acquaint it with the University today. ‘The members of
the Board met with Dr. Cole, members of the faculty, the staff, and the student
body.

They discussed policies and practices, educational and athletic programs,
student attitudes and student life, and the status of traditions. They toured the
campus, saw the buildings and facilities, were exposed to the details of the Self-
Study program, and discussed with Dr. Cole and the faculty and staff the imple-
mentation of this program, the setting of goals, and the current status of the
University’s long-range planning.

In the course of this intense three-day experience, the Board noted with
approbation a spirit of alertness and open-mindedness among those it met, a
willingness to question and experiment, and a vigorous dedication to standards
of excellence. ‘he University appears to be alive and on the move.

The students are not content with complacency and the status quo, but are
sensitive, keen, often dissatisfied and searching. ‘They are maintaining the essen-
tial traditions, not routinely but thoughtfully and purposefully, so that their
self-imposed rules are modern and as alive as in the past.

The faculty and staff indicate a deep loyalty to the school and its mission.
There is clearly a vigorous and sensitive dedication to the student and to assur-
ing him a superior college education. ‘These men are raising the University’s
standards of excellence, and they are looking to the future. There is an air of
teamwork and quiet confidence among them.

The Board found its three days experience on the campus stimulating. In its
opinion, Dr. Cole, the faculty, staff, and the student body deserve the enthusi-
astic support of the University alumni. They continue the work of maintaining
and building this great institution.

‘TREASURER JAMES W. WHITEHEAD points out to Alumni Directors land that could be used for campus expansion,

tees institute a policy of granting
sabbatical leaves to qualified mem-
bers of the University faculty.

This resolution contained the
declaration that the Alumni Board
had had the opportunity to meet
many members of the Washington
and Lee faculty and had been “uni-
formly impressed with its ability,
character and dedication.” It sug-
gested sabbatical leaves “in the in-
terest of retaining a faculty of this
caliber.” ‘The question of sabbati-
cal leaves also received much atten-
tion in the University’s Self-Study.

In other action, the board

learned that the Alumni House
Fund had reached more than $77,-
000 as of September 15; (The Fund
58 1,000.);

subsequently exceeded
approved a draft copy of a state-

ment of policy on the use of the

FALL-WINTER 1967

‘A

Alumni House and a report on the
chair fund.

The three-day program began
with a Thursday session at which
Dr. Cole, Mr. Parsons and Univer-
sity Treasurer James W. White-
head presented an authoritative
summation of the University’s stat-

us today, its prospects for the short

and long-range future, the effect of

the Self-Study on the administra-
tion, including the ‘Trustees, and
a discussion of the Statement of In-
stitutional Philosophy contained in
the Self-Study Report.

The directors then toured the
campus for a first-hand look at fa-
cilities, with special emphasis on
problem areas or areas of special
need—including a new gymnasium
and student union.

There was a special report by the
Deans of the University. There was

 

a special program on faculty mat-
ters that covered the problems of
maintaining a strong teaching fac-
ulty in competition with other
colleges, business, government and
the problems of faculty mobility,
turnover, and replacement. Cov-
ered too, were the University’s
strengths and weaknesses in this
competition.

The University’s athletic pro-
eram received a thorough going
over. This session provided the di-
rectors with an up-to-date evalua-
tion of the University’s non-subsi-
dized athletic program, including
an evaluation of the problems of
scheduling and recruiting and the
economics of such a program. ‘The
need for a new facility to replace
53-year-old Doremus Gymnasium
was emphasized.

A highlight of the program was

Body President William Jeffress re-
port on the status of students tradi-
tions and the Honor System. Also
the directors, during the time they
were on the Washington and Lee
campus, talked with many other
students.

[heir impression of the caliber
of students now attending Wash-
ington and Lee was summed up in
their formal statement: “The stu-
dents are not content with com-
placency and the status quo, but
are sensitive, keen, often dissatisfied
and searching. They are maintain-
traditions, not

ing the essential

routinely, but thoughtfully and
purposelully, so that their self-
imposed rules are modern and as
alive as in the past.”

Another session covered a status
report on admissions matters and
financial aid, including a provision
of insight as to the purpose and
function of the Admissions Com-
mittee.

Mostly the program was hard

work of the kind that goes along
with an exchange of ideas and dis-
cussions of matters affecting the
welfare of a great institution of
learning.

But it was not all work. There
were social hours, luncheons and
dinners that included the directors’
wives. President and Mrs. Cole were
hosts at a reception at their home
before one of two dinners attended
heads,

by academic department

deans, and other administrative

staff members and their wives.

 

 

 

 

 

And on the final morning, Sat-

NE OF THE NATION'S leading
Cys ey, three distin-
guished alumni, including the Gov-
ernor of Delaware, and 18 students
were tapped for membership in
Delta Alpha
Circle at Washington and Lee at

Omicron Kappa 's
the annual “tap day” assembly on
February 22.

Harrison F. Dunning, president
and chief executive ofhicer of the
Scott Paper Co. ol Philadelphia,
was honored and was also the prin-
cipal speaker.

He urged more young people to
enter the business world and _ to
provide the leadership it needs to
keep the tree enterprise system

strong in the years ahead.
The alumni tapped were Charles

‘g0L, an attorney in Jacksonville,
Edwin A.
chairman of the board of Blue Bell,
Inc., of Greensboro, N.C.

Fla.: and Morris, ‘26,

Dunning, in his address, said
that too many college graduates are
turning away from a_ business
career because of “ill-founded con-
ceptions that business is overly con-
cerned with materialistic values”
and that it fails to provide feelings
of satisfaction and accomplishment.

He said that after being in busi-
ness for 36 years he could dispel
such misconceptions. He said that
today’s competitive business enter-
prise gives each member wide lati-
tude for imaginative and rewarding
action.

He stressed a need for talented
young people in accounting, fi-
nance, marketing and management.
He said these fields will demand
“exceptional people” in the years
ahead of growing complexity in
business.

The student initiates were tapped
for their qualities of leadership on
the campus.

The Packers Are Different

HE GREEN BAY PACKERS, in addi-
‘ee to being the defending
World Campions, are a rather
unique football organization and
because of this fact, my job is per-
haps unlike any other in profes-
sional sports.

For one, the Packers are a com-
munity owned team (1,700 share
holders in a non-profit corporation)
coached and managed by one man.
Vince Lombardi is the sole author-
ity in all matters, both on and off
the field.

At home, in both Green Bay and
Milwaukee (we play 4 regular sea-
son games per year in Green Bay;
3 in Milwaukee) all tickets are sold
on a season basis. All games are
sold out in advance and there are
over 8,000 names on the waiting
list, but their chances of securing
tickets are minimal.

Tickets can be passed from gen-
eration to generation and there is
generally no turn over of seats.

On the road, the Packers are the
number one drawing attraction in
the National Football League, play-
ing to capacity in all but two sta-
diums in the 1966 season.

Due both to the team’s success
on the field and the community
pride in the club, there is obviously
little need to promote the team and
my duties as Publicity and Public
Relations Director are oriented
more towards supplying the news
media with information and _ser-
vices,

In the past three years, I have
been associated with promotion of
Harlem Globetrotter basketball and
while they are world famous and
a good show, they are not a com-
modity that appeals to the seasoned
sports enthusiast year after year.

By Cuuck LANE, “63

There is very litthe new that you
can say about them and the out-
come of the action is never in
doubt.

Consequently my duties with the
Trotters was one of promotion
rather than public relations.

On the other hand, the Packers
are an entirely different story. The
public and those who cover pro
football cannot get enough material
on the Packers. They have been the

 

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Charles (Chuck) Lane, ‘63, was one
of Washington and Lee’s better foot-
ball players of the last decade. During
his three varsity years as a quarterback
the Generals won 35 games, tied one
and lost one. General fans will not
forget that Thanksgiving Day game
against Washington University in St.
Louis in 1961. The Generals were trail-
ing 6-20 in the closing minutes of the
half. Lane called a pass play, and
everybody knew it was going to be a
pass play. Lane faded, faked, threw.
He connected for an 80-yard touch-
down. The play turned the tide, and
the Generals won in the end 33-20.
It preserved the Generals’ undefeated
season that year.

Now Lane is Publicity Director for
another big winner—the Green Bay
Packers—the professional football team
for which his Washington and Lee
coach, Lee McLaughlin, once played.

Lane tells in this article about his
work and why he likes it. It was
written last fall before the Packers
polished off the Kansas City Chiefs in
the Super Bowl.

In a note to the editors, Lane said
about the article: “I can hardly wait
until all the W&L Alumni see it and
think ‘Aha, here is my long awaited
source of free Packer tickets!’” But it
is a fleeting hope. The Packers’ waiting
list for tickets, as Lane points out,
exceeds 8,000.

standard of football excellence since
Vince Lombardi took over in 1959,
and everybody enjoys hearing about
a winner.

And with the uniform quality of
every team in the League, the old
bromide “on any given Sunday, any
team is capable of beating any other
team” certainly holds true. Every-
one points for their game with the
Packers and, unfortunately for us,
seems to play their best against
Green Bay.

My primary duty is to provide
the media with up-to-date informa-
tion and statistics on the players
and team and also have available
films and video tapes to illustrate
various points during interviews.

Also as Publicity Director, you
are often called upon to furnish
ideas and arguments to support
these ideas for feature stories and
on some occasions correct impres-
sions that newsmen have developed
about an individual or the team.
Of course it is impossible to moni-
tor everything that is being said
about the team, but often, by pre-
senting strong enough arguments
supported by statistics, you can
alter the course of publicity.

As Publicity Director, I have a
responsibility to supply the news-
men who cover pro football with
information, but I feel also that my
primary responsibility is to the
Packers. Often it calls for maintain-
ing an uneasy truce between the
two, but by and large our writers
honor our request that certain mat-
ters be left private.

This season, the Packers are con-
fronted with a “problem” that 14
other NFL coaches would prefer to
have: being the defending World
Champions. Everyone has picked

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

the Packers to repeat again this year

and has given our three number
one draft choices a great deal of
publicity. Consequently they have
created the potential problem of
complacency and jealousy.

football
games are settled on the field, not

Everyone knows that
through speculation, and if a team
lets itself believe that they are invin-
cible they are likely to be shocked
back to reality the following Sun-
day. Here the coach must maintain
the proper squad attitude and it is
my job to keep any publicity that
might adversely affect squad morale
at a minimum.

Secondly, in Donny Anderson,
Jim Grabowski, and Gale Gilling-
ham the Packers were most fortu-
nate in securing three of the na-
tion’s top college football players
via the draft. However, the team
wasn’t the only fortunate one. Cir-
cumstances dictated a financial war
with the then-rival AFL for the
services of these players and in the

bidding that ensued, three untested
rookies acquired some rather hand-
some bonuses for signing with
Green Bay. The result on the vet-
erans’ morale is obvious, but Coach
Lombardi has managed to keep the
discontent at an absolute minimum.

The press plays up the “million
dollar” angle and frequently bases
their appraisal on the dollar, so as
Publicity Director I try to see that
the proven veterans get the deserved
amount of publicity and recogni-
tion.

Our publicity is designed to draw
attention to the entire team rather
than individuals, because the game
is one of teamwork rather than in-
dividual stars.

When
from home, I arrive early on lTues-

the Packers play away

day, providing the local press, radio
and TV with information on our
team. I stay in town until the team
arrives, handle the arrangements for
the press covering the Packers, and
then return to Green Bay with the
team.

For home games, I am _ respon-
sible for the operation of the press
box and the needs of the visiting
This

writers from other cities, national

team and _ press. includes
magazine correspondents, and CBS-
EN.

During the off-season (roughly
from Feb. 1 to July 15) we are in-
volved in writing stories and _ re-
leases that you see featured in
football forecasts, press information
guides for the upcoming season, and
the handling of player endorse-
ments and public appearances. In
short, the off-season is that in name
only.

 

Next year, | will also become in-

volved in the design, layout, and
publishing of the game program in
addition to the other duties.

Since games are played on Sun-
days for the most part, our schedule
calls for a seven day work week, but
it is really fascinating. The people
encountered are most interesting
and when you enjoy the game of
football as I do, it really doesn't
seem like work. Other than the ob-
vious disadvantages of long term
suitcase dwelling, it is ideal.

Future plans are uncertain at
present, but they will surely be for
a continuation of my career in pro
football. The game has enjoyed a
tremendous growth the last five to
ten years and all indications point
to continued popularity. With tele-
vision’s increasing role and_ the
rapid expansion of the League,
there is unlimited opportunity, but
for the present, I feel extremely
fortunate to be associated with this
fine Green Bay Packer organization.

UNRESTRICTED GIFTS
Washington and Lee University
in late 1966 received several un-
restricted grants. The American Oil
Foundation gave $5,000, which
President Fred C. Cole said would
be used to increase the resources
ol McCormick
branches on campus. He said the

Library and its

gift would help the University
further its quality of service. The

Esso Education Foundation gave

52,500, which President Cole said
“Is an expression of confidence in
our program of quality education.”
The  Sears-Roebuck
gave 51,500, which President Cole

Foundation

said “will sustain us in our effort
to perform ever more useful service
to the young men who study on
our campus.”

A Girt or Books

McCormick Library recently re-
ceived the gift of 4,800 books from
the estate of Carter Newman Bealer

of Washington, D.C., who was

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

graduated from Washington and
Lee in 1922. Mr. Bealer’s wide
range of interests is reflected in the
collection. The collection includes
many biographies of theatrical per-
sonalities, histories of the British
and American theater and of con-
temporary plays. Included, too, are
volumes on world literature and
poetry and art—particularly Ameri-
can painting—and “how-to-draw”
books. There are books on Ameri-
can culture, architecture, wildlife
and pottery. Mr. Bealer had a keen
interest in cats and collected sev-
eral hundred books on them, many
of them children’s stories about
cats. Included in the collection are
several cat “autobiographies.” Li-
brarian Henry C. Coleman, Jr.
called the collection a welcome
addition. He said many of the
volumes would fill in works missing
from other collections and many
would replace worn out or mis-
placed books in the library.

Bad things about Robert E.
IO ie

Washington and Lee Univers-
ity officials scratched their heads
as they pondered this question
from Renee Dygutowicz, a 10-
year-old Ohio school girl.
S. Grant's
side in a classroom debate. She

Renee was on U.

wrote the University requesting
“any bad things or habits” Lee
had.

“I am trying to prove that
General Grant was better than
Lee,” she wrote. “My team is
counting on me. We are getting
graded for this, and I would like
to get a good grade.”

Lee scholars at the University
came up with an incident early
in the Civil War when Lee, ever
the gentleman, failed to take
stern measures against one of his
subordinate generals whose negli-
gence allowed a Union force to
escape a trap.

Douglas Southall Freeman told
about it in his four-volume biog-
raphy of Lee: “Of Lee it became
necessary to ask... whether his
judgment as a soldier or his con-
sideration as a gentleman domi-
nated his acts.”

Renee informed the University
later that the debate was a tie
and added plaintively: “I wish
I had been on Lee’s side.”

Lee, we think, would have
given her a good grade.

 

 

STruDENT Alp INCREASES

Washington and Lee students
are receiving about $345,000 in
scholarship and other financial aid
this academic year. Farris P. Hotch-
kiss, Director of Financial Aid,
reported that 317 of 1,386. stu-
dents are receiving financial help
from several sources, including two
new federally sponsored programs
—College Work-Study and the Edu-
cational Opportunity Grant  pro-
gram. The total aid figure is about
$40,000 higher than last year.
Hotchkiss said the University’s aid
goal is “to make a Washington and
Lee education available to every
man who has gained admission,
regardless of his financial situa-
tion.”

A New Nove. By DAvIs

Paxton Davis, professor of jour-

book. His latest novel is entitled
The Seasons of Heroes and will be
published by William Morrow &
Co. Prof. Davis describes the book
as a short work of between 75,000
and 80,000 words. It is the story
of three generations of a family
living in the Shenandoah Valley of
Virginia. His previous works in-
clude Two Soldiers (1956), which
contained two short war novels;
The Battle of New Market (1963),
a fictional work for juveniles now
in its second printing, and One of
the Dark Places (1965), a story
concerned with a typhus epidemic
in Burma and scheduled for release
in paperback form soon.

On January 19, 1967—the 160th
anniversary of the birth of Robert
E. Lee—President Fred C. Cole rose
in Doremus Gymnasium and _ ad-
dressed the assembled students and
faculty of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity. It was the traditional Lee’s

11

Campus (,azette...

Birthday-Founders’ Day convoca-
tion, and President Cole said in
part:

... Lee remains a hero in the
eyes of millions. He remains a hero
of the history of this University. We
honor his memory today, not only
for what he accomplished when he
was this institution's president, but
also for what he hoped to accomp-
lish. His aspiration that this school
become a great institution is one
that we continue to pursue today
and will pursue diligently in the
future. We honor Lee for his con-
tribution—and for his Inspiration.

“... The professor is the great
resource that a college has to offer.
Students can get information from
a book or journal, read it at home
or in a library. They can acquire
laboratory skills and learn tech-
niques on the job. Almost anything
they derive in the way of extra-
curricular benefits can be afforded
by a variety of private or com-
munity clubs and activities. Only
in college, however, can be found
the guidance, the association, and
the inspiration of the wise and
sympathetic teacher. The teacher
in a great college or university must
be an able communicator of know!l-
edge, an enthusiastic scholar, and
a patient counselor.

“We have always had such teach-
ers here on this campus. As students
in daily contact with our professors
you can attest to this at present
more effectively than anyone.

“But there are others outside the
University who are aware of the
excellence of our faculty. They
recognize the distinctive services
that are being rendered here in
undergraduate education.”

vited the Board of Directors of the

“The Visiting Committee of the
Southern Association of College
and Schools was also on campus
in early November for purposes of
reviewing the work of our Self-
Study... While its report contains
both general and _ specific sugges-
tions and recommendations on
ways we can become better and
stronger, the report generally sup-
ports the contention I make here
today—that the University, its fac-

good, and with diligence and dedi-
cation on everyone’s part will grow
better in the months and years
ahead.”

Death Claims
Mattingly
At Age 78

 

ARL STANSBURY MATTINGLY did
Be like for Washington and
Lee people to use thumb tacks on
the doors of University buildings.
It marred the paint, he said. He
liked to keep things straight—the
accounts, the records, the grounds,
the names of students—everything
having to do with Washington and
Lee,

Some students, faculty members
and administrative associates may
have joked occasionally about the
finicky “Mr. Matt.” But no one
scoffed at his devotion to the Uni-
versity. He was universally admired
for his efficiency. He had the affec-
tion of his colleagues and was popu-
lar the

throughout University

community.

When Mattingly retired in July,
1966, the Board of ‘Trustees, in a
resolution, expressed “its deep
sense of appreciation for Mr. Mat-
tingly’s distinguished record of
service and its gratification that his
experience, wisdom and friendship
Uni-
versity, the president, and the mem-
the

will continue to benefit the

ahead.”

The next year he was appointed
registrar while still working toward
his A. B. degree. He earned it in
1925. He remained registrar for 20
years, and in 1940 he became the
University’s first full-time treasurer
and secretary.

Mr. Mattingly had a prodigious
memory. He made it a point to
memorize the name, face, home-
town, local address and grades of
every Washington and Lee student,
about 600 to 700 yearly, during the
1920's and 1930's. The faculty in a
tribute to him upon his retirement
said he was “never more effective
than when he is presenting and in-
terpreting University purposes and
problems...a task made easy by
his rich background and his extra-
ordinary memory for the names of
generations of students, their fam-
ilies and other friends of the Uni-
versity.”

His career was long. His retire-

Dr. Cole said in announcing Mr.
Mattingly’s retirement: “I know of
no one who has been more loyal,
more dedicated to the best interests
of this University, and I know of
no one who has been a greater
friend to generation after genera-

Dr. Desha Dies at Age 83

NE DAY IN MARCH, Brewster S.

Ford, associate professor of
English at Virginia Military Inst-
tute and president of the Lexington
English Speaking Union, came to
Washington and Lee University.
He brought with him a check for
$500 and presented it to President
Fred C. Cole.

The money was the initial con-
tribution toward the establishment
of a memorial fund in honor of
Dr. Lucius Junius Desha, professor
of chemistry, emeritus, at Washing-
ton and Lee, who died January 31,
1967, at the age of 83. Income from
the Desha fund will help English
exchange students at Washington
and Lee with incidental expenses,
such as books. Dr. Desha was presi-
dent of the English Speaking Union
for many years.

At the March meeting of the
Washington and Lee faculty, Dr.
Gilreath,
chemistry, rose and read a resolu-

Esmarch professor of
tion of respect to the memory of
Dr. Desha. The resolution, sub-
mitted by Drs.
Keith Shillington and
Buchanan, said in part:

Gilreath, James
William

“Washington and Lee lost a
distinguished professor, emeritus,
death ol
Rarely
have the degree of ability, versa-
tility, and

in the Lucius Junius

Desha. does one person
personality that was
possessed by Dr. Desha. He gradu-
ated from Washington and Lee in
1906 and attained his Ph.D. degree
from Johns Hopkins University in
1igog. Only brief mention will be
made concerning the most notable
achievements accomplished during
his continuous service to his college
and to his community. They most
ably speak for themselves.

“As a teacher and head of the

FALL-WINTER 1967

 

Chemistry Department, Dr. Desha
taught in Washington and Lee Uni-
veristy from 1920 to 1955. Various
interruptions of his teaching career
took advantage of his ability as an
administrator. In 1946 he was
drafted into the position as dean
of the University, and in 1946
and 1949 he had charge of the
University’s bicentennial program.

 

Dr. DeSHA in the classroom.

Even after semi-retirement, he was
again called upon in 1960 to act
as coordinator for the inauguration
of President Cole. In 1962 he was
director of the community fund
campaign conducted by Friends of
the Library in Lexington, which
culminated in a modern city li-
brary.
“AS. a

scholar his textbook

Organic Chemistry was not only
widely used but was a pioneer text
in its field. He served as president
of Phi Beta Kappa for two years
and was the executive officer of the
organization during the last thir-
teen years of his life. He was a
member of Sigma Xi and the Omi-
cron Delta Kappa societies.

“The members of Washington
and Lee faculty and staff bear a
great sorrow in the loss of an out-
standing colleague. However, even
in our own bereavement, we rec-
ognize the greater grief of his im-
mediate the final
summons to a noble character.”

family upon

Dr. Desha is survived by his wife,
the former Mary Forrester, and
three daughters, Mrs. Charles L.
Green of Charlotte, N.C., Mrs. G.
Stansbury Miller of Moorestown,
N. J., and Mrs. Charles Didier of
Maumee, Ohio. The family lived
on the Washington and Lee campus
for many years.

Dr. Desha taught chemistry at
the medical school of the University
of Tennessee until he joined the
faculty at Washington and Lee in
1920.

He was active in the civic and
social life of the community. He
was a chairman of the social func-
tions committee of the University,
and he and Mrs. Desha were ad-
visers for the Fancy Dress Ball.
And at the age of 76, he took up
painting and won prizes in com-
munity shows.

Some associates say that if Dr.
Desha had a fault it was his tend-
ency to take on too much work.
He was active in nearly every phase
of University and community life.

If it were a fault, Washington
and Lee is the better for it.

Pinck Is Awarded

Silver Anniversary

All-America Trophy

OBERT LLOYD PINCK, ‘42, Was
R once a Saturday hero. For three
years, he was an outstanding player
on the Washington and Lee foot-
ball team, and he was captain ol
the 1941 team.

Those were not championship
years for the Generals. But Pinck
was a durable player. He worked
from the blocking back or fullback
slot in the Generals’ single-wing
attack and backed up the strong
side of the line on defense. Win or
lose, Pinck turned in a creditable
game he

performance in every

played. He excelled also in basket-

1s

ball and tennis.
But his
athlete was just an interlude in

prowess as a_ college
his life—or rather a prelude to dis-
tinctive achievements in medicine.

In the 25 years since he won
honors for Washington and Lee on
the football field, Pinck has become
one of the nation’s foremost radio-
logists, a leader in the training ol
technicians and physicians for serv-
ice in this vital field of medicine
and a contributor to the literature
of radiological research.

Small wonder then that on Janu-

ary 19, 1967,

magazine conferred upon Dr.
Robert Lloyd Pinck one of its Silver
All-America

He was presented the magazine’s

Anniversary Awards.
goalpost trophy at the New York
Touchdown Club dinner at the
Americana Hotel, along with 25
other businessmen, doctors, educa-
tors, military officers and lawyers
who have distinguished themselves
in the 25 years since their last col-
lege football season.

One other Washington and Lee
football standout has been named
Sports Illustrated Silver
Award team. Amos Alonzo Bolen,

to. the
a Generals’ All-America in 1939,
was chosen for the award in 1958.

Dr. Pinck is now chief of the
Radiology Department at Long
Island College Hospital in Brook-
lyn. In February a year ago, he
was accorded one of the highest
honors in his profession. He was
made a fellow in the American Col-
lege of Radiology. And a month
later he was appointed a member o!
the Committee on Education in
Diagnostic Roentgenology of the
American College of Radiology.

He is not only a successful physi-
clan, scientist, and educator. He has
also done well in business. In 1958,
he was a co-founder of the North
Atlantic Life Insurance Company
of America and continues as a di-
rector of the firm’s executive com-
mittee.

He is a native of Passaic, N. J.,
and when he was 10 his family
moved to Paterson. There in his
first day of school he had three fist
fights with progressively larger
boys, and he managed to win them
all. It was the last time, he said,
that he was forced to settle his
problems by violence. He said he
remembered the incident vividly
because it influenced his values of
sportsmanship, and these values
subsequently influenced his profes-
sional development.

After leaving Washington Lee,
he enrolled at Duke University’s
School of Medicine and was caught

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

up in a war-accelerated program
that forced him to complete 36
months of training without a break.

He decided to specialize in ra-
diology while at Walter Reed Hos-
pital during his Army duty. He
later served in Europe, and while
on a vacation in Switzerland he met
Helene Rast, who became his wife
fifteen months later.

Upon his return from Europe,
Dr. Pinck resumed his training at
the ‘Tennessee University Institute
of Pathology. He was accepted for
a residency at Duke and later spent
three months at the University
Hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland,
and three months at the Curie
Foundation in Paris for special
study in X-ray therapy.

In 1952, Dr. Pinck was named as-
sistant attending radiologist at
Roosevelt Hospital in New York
City and was promoted to associate
attending radiologist during his
three and a half years there.

He was 35 when he was ap-
pointed chief radiologist at Long
Island College Hospital. Under his
direction, the

hospital’s Depart-

ment of Radiology has grown
remarkably—from 17,000 examina-
tions in 1955 to more than 40,000
examinations last year, in addition
to a heavy work load in cobalt
therapy and radioactive isotopes.
In 1956, a Ford Foundation grant
of $250,000 to the hospital for capi-
tal improvement was devoted en-
tirely to a new X-ray department,
now one of the most modern in the
world.

He said that of all his achieve-
ments he is proudest of the students
that he has helped educate, both
those in radiologic technology and
those who have trained there as
part of their medical school cur-
riculum.

Dr. and Mrs. Pinck have three
daughters: Laurie, 17; Stacy, 6; and
Lili, 4.

FALL-WINTER 1967

Lynchburg Chapter Honors Dr. Shannon

@ PRESENTATION OF “The Lynch-

burg Citation” to Edgar Finley
Shannon, Jr., 39, president of the
University of Virginia, added a spe-
cial piquancy to the annual Wash-
ington’s Birthday dinner of the
Lynchburg alumni chapter.

The annual award was initiated
by the Hill City alumni five years
ago to recognize notable achieve-

*

ment by an “alumnus of the year”

whose accomplishments — have
brought honor to Washington and
Lee. While no geographical restric-
tions limit the scope of the award,
all previous recipients have been
Virginians.

Actually, the Lynchburg Citation
was presented to Mrs. Shannon
(Sweet Briar °48) as Dr. Shannon
could not be present because of an
attack of flu.
alumni responded enthusiastically

acute Lynchburg
to UVA’s lovely first lady when she
accepted the handsome award on
behalf of her husband, asserting
that “nothing could mean more to
Edgar Shannon than to receive an
honor bestowed by his fellow alum-
ni. He will always have a genuine
affection for his Alma Mater, as I
do.”

Mrs. Shannon was accompanied
to Lynchburg by Paul Saunier, Jr.,
assistant to the president of UVA,

and Mrs. Saunier. They were joined
at the reception and dinner at
Boonsboro Country Club by Wash-
ington and Lee President Dr. Fred
Cole, Dr. and Mrs. Ollinger Cren-
Anne Gary

shaw, and President

Pannell of Sweet Briar College.

Dr. Crenshaw, chairman of the
Department of History, delighted
a large audience of alumni and
their wives, parents of students and
other guests, including a number
of UVA alumni, with a humorous
description of student life and dis-
cipline at Washington College dur-
ing the early 1800's.

After R. C. Wood, Jr., '21L, chap-
ter president, had read the citation,
Mrs. Shannon told the meeting that
her absent husband would appre-
ciate most especially being cited for
his efforts to uphold his “heritage
of scholarship.” (His father, the late
Dr. 7:
Washington and Lee faculty for 24
years and was head of the English

Shannon, served on the

department during his son’s under-
graduate years.)

Elected to serve as chapter officers
for 1967 were S. James Thomp-
son, Jr., °57A-59L, president; Wil-
liam V. Giles, Jr., °61, vice presi-
dent; and John R. Alford, °57A-
'59L, secretary-treasurer.

A Word
About the
Pages
Following

On the next 16 pages General of
the Army Omar N. Bradley, presi-
dent of the George C. Marshall
Foundation, reports on the status,
services and aspirations of the
George C. Marshall Research Li-
brary.

He makes clear the value of the
Library to Washington and Lee
University and, indeed, to the
whole range of education.

Washington and Lee faculty
members, students, and alumni will
certainly in the years ahead make
extensive use of this important
neighboring facility.

President Fred C. Cole is a mem-
ber of the Foundation Board of
Directors, and the late President
Francis P. Gaines was active in the
organization of the Foundation.
The Library is permanently linked
to Washington and Lee because
under its charter the president of
the University is an ex officio mem-
ber of the board.

Royster Lyle, Jr., secretary and
curator, designed the handsome in-
sert containing General Bradley’s
message.

The Editors commend it to you
with pleasure.

an ever-widening basis from the general public and we must hope for continuing
support from those who by their gifts have already demonstrated that they

are interested in the full development of this tribute to a great American. We
must hope for an increase in the number of those who have placed the Library on
their annual giving program and who mention the Library in their wills.

And we must hope for the continued advice and counsel of those

who are in a position to aid us in our efforts.

If these hopes and efforts are realized, | feel confident that at this time next

year, I will be able to report on a year of continued activity

and progress toward our ultimate objectives.
