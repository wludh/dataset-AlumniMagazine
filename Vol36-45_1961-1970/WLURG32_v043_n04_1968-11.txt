Good Morning,
Mr. President

 

N FRIDAY MORNING, October 18, Robert E.

R. Huntley was inaugurated President of
Washington and Lee University. It was a sol-
emn and auspicious occasion—solemn_ because
ritual surrounds such events, auspicious because
it marked the official beginning of the tenure
of a young, energetic, and brilliant son of Wash-
ington and Lee who pledged to devote nothing
less than his whole being to the good of the
University.

The Inauguration of President Huntley
came too late to be covered in detail in this
magazine. Alumni and friends of Washington
and Lee may expect a full report on the Inaugu-
ration in this and other publications. Let it be
said for now that the Inauguration was a time
of renewal of faith in a great institution and
a fitting tribute to the man who heads it. Let
everyone join the Inaugural Speaker, President
William C. Friday of the Consolidated Uni-
versity of North Carolina, in his salutation to
Bob Huntley:

“Yours is the opportunity to associate with
men and women who are indeed committed
to the intellectual, cultural, and spiritual ad-
vancement of this nation. Yours is the privilege
of expressing the hopes that arise out of the
creative dynamism of this university commun-
ity. Yours is the great challenge to bring the
full power of the university to bear in building
a stronger commonwealth, a greater southern
region, and a United States in which there is
greater hope, not despair; tolerance and not
hate; liberty and not injustice; and a country
in which every man receives his proper measure
of respect as a human being and a child of God.

‘To this great experience, worthy of the
personal dedication of any man who posseses
the courage, intelligence, and humility to meet
the test, as I know you do, I bid you a warm
Good Morning, Mr. President.”

NIXON’S THE ONE

Rockefellers last-minute entry almost made Washington and Lee’s
Republican Mock Convention a horse race, but Richard Nixon shook off

the challenge on the third ballot to prove he’s a winner.

EN RIGHT and only four wrong.

That’s the amazing record compiled now by Wash-
ington and Lee students in their mock political con-
ventions. They were proved right again in August
when the Republicans chose Richard M. Nixon as
their candidate, confirming the W&L students’ choice
of last May.

‘That makes it five correct choices in a row, going
back to 1952 and the selection of Dwight Eisenhower.
Not since 1948, when the students chose Arthur Vand-
enburg over ‘Thomas E. Dewey, the actual nominee,
have the students been wrong.

Of the latest correct choice, some people might
say, “Ho hum, so what? Picking Dick Nixon wasn’t
hard to do. He had the real nomination wrapped up
anyway.’ (And at this writing—mid-October—it ap-
pears that he has the presidency locked up, too.)

It looked as if Nixon would be a shoo-in at Wash-
ington and Lee for a while. But, just three days before
the convention began, the on-and-off Nelson Rocke-
feller made his dramatic announcement that he was
a candidate.

The students were pleased. “I’m glad to see it’s

a horse race again,’ said Steven R. Saunders, the
Elmont, N. Y., senior, who was the convention’s perm-
anent chairman and who had been planning the
event since he was a freshman. “Now the convention
really means something again,” Saunders said.

Patrick L. Arey, a junior from Chatham, Va., who
had been practically a one-man “Rockefeller-for-Presi-
dent” committee, was natually very happy.

“Before Rocky came into it officially, I had just
about written the convention off to Nixon,” he said.
“After that though, we had a chance, although it
was only a slight one.”

When Rockefeller was not a candidate, there was
no official national headquarters to help Arey with
materials or money. However, he and a handful of
supporters had been busy for months, making Rocky
posters and buttons and pushing the governor’s candi-
dacy as best they could.

All during the convention Arey and his fellow
Rocky supporters sat at small tables in one corner of
Doremus Gymnasium continually on the telephone
to Rockefeller’s national headquarters for advice on
strategy.

Doremus Gymnasium, above, was jam-packed with bunting and other convention
accouterments, almost like the real affair in Miami Beach. Tennessee
delegation, below, dressed out in traditional Mountaineer garb.

Rocky's dramatic announcement forced a change
in the Nixon strategy as well. Hayward F. Day, Jr.,
a law school senior, head of the former vice presi-
dent’s campaign, changed his assessment of Nixon's
chances from “excellent” to “good.” Day was still
confident Nixon would get the nomination, but he
then doubted a first ballot win. He was hopeful Nixon
would get it on the second.

He was nearly right. Nixon came within 19 votes
on the second and then easily rompted to victory on
the third.

A comparison of the W&L mock convention bal-
loting with the real thing in Miami Beach shows a
remarkable similarity, especially state-by-state. In 16
states the W&L students hit the real vote total exactly,
and in 10 others they were not off by more than one
or two votes. The vote total for Rockefeller and
Ronald Reagan were very close to the real thing.
(In Miami Beach, Rocky had 277, Reagan 182; at
W&L, it was Rocky 302, Reagan 163.)

Jerr WEXLER, above, in the Teddy Roosevelt style,
nominated Colorado's favorite son, Gov. John Love.

After Wexler’s speech, students, below, demonstrated

to the Beatles’ song, “Love.”

 

 

The only major difference was that the W&L
students, acting on the probable GOP course at that
time, nominated even more favorite sons than the
actual Republicans did. It was this that kept Nixon
from winning on the first student ballot, but he gained
considerable strength from the favorite sons on the
second and swept to a landslide victory on the third
ballot.

On the second W&L ballot, after the favorite son
commitments had been honored, the students hit
three more state vote totals on the nose and added
five more near misses. Take the cases of Virginia and
North Dakota. In Miami Beach, the Virginia delega-
tion had to be polled before its vote was determined
at 22 for Nixon, two for Rockefeller. In Lexington,
it was the same, without the poll. The real North
Dakota vote was split five for Nixon, two for Rocky,
one for Reagan. W&L’s students had already voted
exactly the same way.

The worst goof involved Oregon. The students,
who had to vote before the Oregon primary, guessed
wrong and cast all 18 votes for Rockefeller. Nixon,
of course, won the Oregon primary and received that
state’s votes in Miami Beach.

Nixon accepted the students’ nomination shortly
after receiving it. Speaking over a telephone hook-up
from Louisville, Ky., where he was attending the
Kentucky Derby, Nixon said, “I’m very complimented.
I accept this nomination.”

Nixon, who in January spoke in the gymnasium
where the mock convention was held, said the next
President will have “the greatest responsibility that
has ever rested on any president’s shoulders in our
history. For the first time, not only peace abroad
but peace at home must be discussed in an American
campaign. A nation that can’t keep peace at home
certainly cannot keep peace abroad.’ (This became
one of Nixon’s major campaign themes.)

More than two dozen newsmen covered the event,
including representatives from Virginia television sta-
tions, both major wire services, the Washington, D. C.,
papers, and the Washington correspondents for
Florida’s largest daily newspapers.

An innovation at the 1968 Mock Convention in-
volved the platform. In previous years, this was largely
just a perfunctory preliminary to the balloting, but
this time the students attempted seriously to adopt
a platform similar to the real one.

A platform committee, under the guidance of
Andrew Colclough, a senior law student from Arl-
ington, began its work months ahead of time. They

 

read volumes of material about the Republican posi-
tion on the issues, conducted committee hearings, and
heard testimony from numerous experts on the prob-
lems facing the country.

They also sent a 7o-question questionnaire to
about 400 leading Republicans throughout the coun-
try and analyzed GOP and Democratic platforms as
far back as the 1920's.

The document they came up with bore strong re-
semblances to the one adopted in Miami Beach. Just
as they try to do in the balloting, the students em-
phasized authenticity in drawing up the platform.

“It was not necessarily a reflection of the personal
attitudes of the committee members,’’ Colclough said.
“In fact, there were a number of times when per-
sonally the members of the committee were unanim-
ously opposed to a particular plank, but we put them
in because we believed that’s what the Republicans
would do in Miami Beach.”

Later, Colclough presented a copy of the plat-
form to Sen. Everett Dirksen of Illinois, chairman of
the Republican Platform Committee.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

Of necessity, the platform had to be fairly general
and adaptable to any of the possible GOP candidates.
“We think any Republican leader—well, maybe not
Goldwater—could run on this platform,” Colclough
said after the document was drawn up.

Twenty-two pages long and covering everything
from the Vietnam War to the space program and
consumer affairs, the platform sailed through the
Mock Convention, except for a plank on the draft.
Here, a minority plank calling for elimination of the
draft and recruitment of a volunteer army—after the
Vietnam War is settled—was adopted after a rousing
floor fight. Three other minority planks attacking
the space program, calling for a reciprocal free trade
policy, and altering the method of meeting urban
problems, were rejected.

There were the usual array of well-known poli-
ticlans, beauty queens, and curious spectators. Gov.
Claude Kirk of Florida delivered the keynote address,
and nearly everyone agreed that the most explosive
thing about that was the bomb scare which hastened
adjournment of the initial session.

Lexington police notified University President
Robert E. R. Huntley, who was on the convention
floor, that an anonymous telephone caller had said
a bomb was planted in a flower pot and was due to
go off soon. As Kirk wound up his keynote address,
the police and University quietly searched the gym,
but found neither a bomb nor a flower pot.

Student officials included, left to right, PERMANENT CHAIRMAN STEVE SAUNDERS,
NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN STAFFORD KEEGAN, ASSISTANT CHIEF OF PRocOcOL JEFF TWARDY, and SECRETARY JAMES LOWE.

Former Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon addressed
the convention at the second session and presented the
platform for debate. Alumni William E. Brock, III,
'53, and A. Linwood Holton, ’44, took active roles.
Brock, now a Republican congressman from Tennes-
see, was parade marshal. Holton, a Roanoke attorney
and Southeast Regional Coordinator of Nixon’s na-
tional campaign, was temporary chairman and intro-
duced by Gov. Kirk.

Another alumnus, New York Supreme Court
Justice Sol Wachtler, attended the convention. Wacht-
ler, who as a student seconded the nomination of
Eisenhower at the 52 convention, headed the Mock
Convention National Advisory Council.

The 1968 convention was not without its zanier
moments. A truck bearing live elephants to lead the
parade broke down in Winchester and didn’t deliver
its cargo until hours after the parade was over.

Several huge crates of crepe paper and other
decorating materials failed to arrive for use on the
parade floats. Parade chairman Bob McLaughlin gal-
lantly rented a private plane and flew to Baltimore—
the nearest place where such supplies could be ob-
tained in large quantities on such short notice. ‘The
plane returned to Lexington’s unpaved, unlighted
runway after dark on the eve of the convention. Mc-
Laughlin’s fellow students illuminated the runway
with their car lights so the plane could land.

The day before the parade, an overzealous delegate

from Georgia decided to test the “fireproof” material
used to decorate his state’s float. He found out soon
enough as the float burned to the ground. But the
delegation worked all night and rebuilt it in time
to take part in the parade.

 

URING THE 1968 Mock Convention, a brief
ID memorial service was held and a moment of
silence was observed for Tommy Mac Baremore,
a 21-year-old senior from Shreveport, La., who
on March 17 drowned in the Maury River while
on an outing at Goshen Pass. A campus leader
and an outstanding student, Tommy was di-
rector of state delegations for the convention
and active in planning the event. His class-
mates and friends established a scholarship fund
in his memory, and his family and friends estab-
lished in his name a debate award to be given
each year to a Washington and Lee student
“who has distinguished both himself and _ his
University by his contribution to intercollegiate
debating.” Tommy was a leading debater, win-
ning twice the Noell-Eckes Debate Trophy,
awarded annually to the outstanding debater at
Washington and Lee.

On August 13, Lee McLaughlin,
Washington and Lee’s head foot-
ball coach, who was to become
Athletic Director this year, was
electrocuted by a defective freezer
unit at his home and camp near
Lexington. A Michael Philipps, ’64,
former Director of Sports Informa-
tion, wrote the following tribute:

Lee McLaughlin was the
kind of man you'd never for-
get. To meet him was an ex-
perience in itself. He’d come
at you with that big, infecti-
ous smile, stick out his hand,
and right then and there you
had a friend for life.

Many people met Lee Mc-
Laughlin during too short a
life. From the small child of
10 at his summer camp and
home in Rockbridge Baths to
the toughest fullback that
played football for him, Lee
McLaughlin’s influence was a
daily blessing. It was a good
influence, a decent one, an
influence that strengthened
belief in one’s fellow man.

For 11 years, he brought a
quiet feeling of confidence
and determination to the
Washington and Lee athletic
program, from the uncertain
early days of 1957 to the pres-
ent, when the Generals’ non-
subsidized athletic policy is a
recognized success.

Lee McLaughlin was larg-
ely responsible for that. Pick-
ing up the remnants of a van-
ishing football spirit at Wash-
ington and Lee, caused by
the then-controversial 1954
decision to drop athletic
scholarships, he began his
earnest crusade to restore foot-
ball dignity at the school he
loved so much.

“Everybody thought I was
crazy coming to Washington
and Lee’s graveyard,” he said
at the time of his appoint-
ment in 1957. “But it’s the
best school in the country,”
he added, “so how could I go
wrong.”

 

Lee
McLaughlin

1917-1968

For three years, Lee Mc-
Laughlin suffered through the
miseries known only to a foot-
ball coach. In 24 games, the
Generals won only four times,
and that surely would have
made a lesser man call it
quits. But starting in 1960,
his teams embarked upon a
three-season drive that record-
ed 25 wins in 27 games, in-
cluding the undefeated and
untied campaign of 1961. The
Washington, D.C. Touch-
down Club awarded Wash-
ington and Lee its small col-
lege Team-of-the-Year trophy
that year, which Lee Mc-
Laughlin accepted for a very
grateful school.

That was just one testi-
monial to the man. Another
was his nomination by the
University of Virginia, his
alma mater, for Sports Illus-
trated’s Silver Anniversary
All-America Award in 1966,
honoring 25 men for their
contributions to society in the
25 years since their senior
football season.

Lee McLaughlin’s contri-
butions extended far beyond
100 yards. They stretched
through the campus, into Lex-

ington, and on out away from
Virginia to any point where
someone had a former associa-
tion with him as coach, camp
director, and friend.

He continually maintained
those associations. Speaking
to groups in Memphis, Louis-
ville, New Orleans, or where-
ever he felt like going to
talk about Washington and
Lee, he would tell his audi-
ence he held one of the best
three jobs in the United
States. The other two belong-
ed to assistant coaches Boyd
Williams and Buck Leslie.

But he was often irked at
these meetings. There would
always be a few to chastise
Washington and Lee about
its “small-time” approach to
athletics, and that would send
Lee McLaughlin into a quick
speech.

“I don’t think our boys
would like to think of them-
selves as small-time athletes,”’
he would say. “They work
just as hard, hit just as hard,
and want to win just as much
as the athletes at larger
schools.

“What we take out of it is
the professionalism, the spec-
tacle for the crowd’s sake
alone. Our boys are playing
for the school and for them-
selves, and that’s the way it
should be.”

Lee McLaughlin kept every-
thing in perspective, and be-
cause he did he was admired
and envied by many of his
fellow coaches. His was a re-
laxed and easy-going approach
to collegiate athletics, and he
said that athletic programs
should complement the over-
all educational process, not
take precedence over it.

And this is what made him
so perfect for Washington
and Lee. He believed first in
his own philosophy, which

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

was a carbon-copy of Wash-
ington and Lee’s philosophy.
‘The two were made for each
other.

His loss will be deeply felt,
of course, and the school will
sorely miss a man that gave
so much to it. But he will not
be forgotten, as President
Robert E. R. Huntley so well
expressed: “He was a part of
the heart and soul of Wash-
ington and Lee, and his death
leaves a void which cannot be
filled. But he brought to this
institution a vitality and a
spirit which will never die.”

All those things you hear
about building character can-
not be said about Lee Mc-
Laughlin. He didn’t build
character, he gave it away.
You drew from him, and you
just wish it could have been
more.

McLaughlin
Memorial Fund

The Lee Massey McLaugh-
lin Memorial Scholarship
Fund has been established at
Washington and Lee in honor
of Coach Mac. The scholar-
ship will be awarded each
year to a rising junior who
exemplifies the spirit, vitality,
and nobility of character of
Lee McLaughlin. The award
will be based on the recipi-
ent’s financial need and will
continue through his junior
and senior years.

A group of anonymous
donors have assured that the
fund will meet the Univer-
sity’s requirements for an en-
dowed scholarship. Additional
gifts to the fund are welcom-
ed and are being received.
Checks should be made pay-
able to Washington and Lee
University and designated for
the Lee Massey McLaughlin
Memorial Scholarship Fund.

A SUMMER

Several shifts in administrative
responsibilities, additional leaves
of absence for faculty members,
deaths in the University family,
appointments of new faculty mem-
bers, and the return of several
faculty members from leaves—all
these combined to make the Sum-
mer of 1968 a season of change for
the University.

Some of the changes have been
reported in previous issues of the
Alumni Magazine. The following
is a resume to bring readers up to
date:

# Roy L. STEINHEIMER, JR., for-
mer professor of law at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, has assumed his
position as Dean of the School of
Law. He succeeded RoserT E. R.
HuNTLEY, who became President
of the University last February.
CHARLEs P. LIGHT, who was interim
acting dean, has returned to full-
time teaching duties.

# Maurice D. LEAcH, Jr. is the
new head Librarian, replacing
HENRY COLEMAN who retired on
July 1. Mr. Leach was professor of
library science and department
chairman at the University of Ken-
tucky.

a E. GraHAm (Buck) LESLIE, JR.
has been named acting head foot-
ball coach, following the death on
August 13 of LEE M. MCLAUGHLIN.
Mr. Leslie was assistant coach in
charge of the backfield. E. P. (Cy)
‘TwosLy, who was to retire Sep-
tember 1, is continuing for the
time being as athletic director, a
post Mr. McLaughlin was to as-
sume.

mw FRANK A. Parsons, formerly Di-

OF CHANGE

rector of Development, has been
appointed Assistant to the Presi-
dent. He will be concerned with
immediate and long-range plan-
ning and assist President Hunt-
ley in coordinating activities of the
University’s administrative offices.
He will continue to direct the Uni-

 

CoAcH E. GRAHAM LESLIE

versity’s overall program of pub-
lic relations and information.

a Farris P. Hotcukiss, formerly
Associate Director of Development,
succeeded Mr. Parsons as Director
of Development. He will super-
vise all the University’s fund-rais-
ing and support activities.

es Lewis G. JOHN has returned

Any gathering of lawyers or
judges is likely to bring to-
gether a large number of
Washington and Lee gradu-
ates, reflecting the remarkable
record of judicial service per-
formed by Washington and
Lee men across the country.

One such event was a semi-
nar this summer at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina
conducted by the National
College of State Trial Judges,
a privately endowed organiza-
tion affiliated with the Judi-
cial Administration Section
of the American Bar Associa-
tion. Attending were 118 state
trial judges from 42 states. Of
this number, at least seven
were Washington and Lee

A Record Run by Zeliff

Le:

 

Senior co-captain Harry
Zeliff of Staunton, Va., set a
Washington and Lee cross-
country record October 12 in
a triangular meeting with Old
Dominion and Roanoke Col-
leges during the halftime of
the W&L-Lafayette football
game. Zeliff covered the gruel-
ing 4.1-mile run in 23:36.0,
breaking by four seconds the
old mark set in 1966 by Lee
Johnson.

An English major, Zeliff is
a member of the Trouba-
dours, Circle K, Young Demo-
crats, debate team, and Phi
Epsilon Pi social fraternity.

In spite of Zeliff’s fine per-
formance, the Generals lost
both ends of the meet to put
the season record at 4-2.

E COLONNADE OF Washington and Lee made
the scene this past summer in New York City.
James N. Applebaum, ’62, reported that the
Dry Dock Savings Bank’s headquarters building
at Lexington Ave. and E. 59th St.—one of Man-
hattan’s busiest intersections—used a massive,
full-color photo of the W&L campus as the back-
drop for a three-dimensional setting that pro-
moted the bank’s student loan program.
(In the picture, you can see the columns of
a W&L faculty house through an imitation gate.
The picture was taken from the walk that leads
toward the Colonnade from Washington Street.)
Mr. Applebaum and others familiar with the

FALL 1968

 

campus stopped in the bank to ask about the
picture. Harvey Corbett, the bank’s advertising
director, said the picture was gleaned from
hundreds of college pictures supplied by “a stock
photo house.”

“We selected the shot because we thought it
uncommonly attractive and rather ideal of what
a residential college campus should look like,”
Mr. Corbett said. He added that the angle of the
shot gave the display the desired depth.

“No old school ties prompted the choice of
the picture,” he went on. “The men who de-
signed the display and those who put it up were
not even college graduates.”

HEN WOODROW WILSON held the first presidential

Wy news conference in history, Gilmore Iden, ‘07,

was there to cover it. Today—at the age of 83—he is

still pounding out newspaper copy—a weekly column

on national politics for the Aiken (S.C.) Standard and
Review—‘just to keep my hand in.”

His hand has been in a lot of journalism—and
history—since he began his writing career under
Theodore Roosevelt’s administration. He was per-
sonally acquainted with every President from Taft
through Kennedy and received from each an auto-
graphed photograph. In 1965, Mr. Iden designated
the Lee Memorial Journalism Foundation as the
permanent repository of the collection, and the pic-
tures are now on display on the second floor of Reid
Hall.

His forte was financial reporting. He specialized as
a Washington correspondent in-government finance
until 1919, and his first big assignment was to write
a review of the Federal Reserve Act. He later be-
came managing editor of the New York Journal of
Commerce. In 1927, he became secretary of the Ameri-
can Institute of Steel Construction and later assisted
in the establishment of the United States Daily in
Washington. He joined the Bureau of National Affairs
in 1940 and moved to the U. S. News and World
Report in 1948, becoming its chief United Nations
correspondent. He is the author of several books and
magazine articles on financial and economic subjects.
He retired in 1962 and lives in Aiken with Mrs. Iden,
two of whose brothers attended Washington and Lee.

Enrollment 1968: Freshmen Up, Law Down

oe AND LEE BEGAN its 220th academic
year with an enrollment of 1,458, three short
of last year’s record enrollment.

The Freshman Class, however, was larger by five—
361 compared with 356 a year ago. Undergraduate
upperclassmen numbered g11, a slightly higher figure
than last year, reflecting the University’s improved
holding power of students in all classes.

The School of Law experienced a rather sharp
decline in enrollment because of the draft situation.
But Roy L. Steinheimer, the new Law Dean, said the

drop was not as great as expected last year when de-
ferments of graduate students were eliminated. The
Law School has this year 186 students compared with
216 last year—a loss of 30. The Law School reported
that at least 20 students who were admitted to the
first-year class were drafted before school opened.
In addition, another 20 rising second-year students
were drafted during the summer. The school, how-
ever, was able partly to make up these losses by hav-
ing a backlog of qualified applicants.

There are 38 sons of alumni in the 1968 Freshman
class. They and their fathers are:

TREPOR T of GIFTS

Washington and Lee’s Annual Giving

 

 

The following pages record the generosity of the
University’s alumni, parents and friends. These con-
tributions are not simply gifts of money. They are
expressions of devotion; they are provisions for the
continued excellence of Washington and Lee.

Every year your University turns to you for this
support. It always will. The plain fact is that a private
university must receive a substantial part of its finan-
cial needs from persons like you. Your gifts make a
difference to Washington and Lee. The difference is
between its just getting along and its having the re-
sources for greatness. The strength of the University
is tied directly to the measure of your giving.

During the past year, Washington and Lee recorded
a new high in financial support from its annual giving
programs. Already, the benefits are in effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Robert E. Lee Associates

 

Over the long reach of Washington and Lee
University s history one man stands above all
others in the manner of his influence upon the
institution. No student who has attended
Washington and Lee in over one hundred
years has been untouched by the personal
ideals and the educational foresight of Robert
E.. Lee.

The Board of Trustees of Washington and
Lee University has therefore found it fitting
that the University’s most generous and loyal
benefactors be brought together and acknowl-
edged as the Robert E. Lee Associates.

Among the purposes of the Robert E. Lee
Associates are these:

To enable the University to recognize and
honor those persons whose support of Wash-
ington and Lee and whose enthusiasm for its

role in higher education are unmistakably
above the ordinary.

To provide a focus of leadership that will
give direction and impetus to all of the Uni-
versity s annual giving programs.

To bring to the University each year a substan-
tial sum of money that will be a cornerstone of
strength in meeting the University’s constant
challenge to sustain its reputation as an insti-
tution of truly distinctive merit.

Special recognition as a charter member of
the Robert E. Lee Associates continues to be
December, 31, 1968. One

hundred and six persons have become charter

available until
members as of the printing of this report; their
aggregate giving stands at an_ inspiring
$197,231.52. They are:

Annual Alumni Fund

The University’s alumni, every year, make
a collective effort to promote the ability of
Washington and Lee to be excellent in all
respects. The 1967-68 Annual Alumni Fund
is the largest investment that alumni have ever
made in their alma mater through annual giv-
ing. It is a challenge for new measures of sup-
port in the years ahead. The opportunity it
affords Washington and Lee can be derived
from no other source.

In the following honor roll of alumni donors,
under each class heading are two graphs re-
cording the achievement of that particular
class. The top graph shows the percentage of
class members who contributed to the 1967-68
Annual Alumni Fund, i.e.:

Each class had an objective — a dollar quota
it sought to attain. The second graph records
the percent of its quota realized by that class,
1.€.5

For all alumni, the 1967-68 Annual Alumni
Fund presents this picture:
% of alumni who contributed

An asterisk after an individual’s name indi-
cates that the person is deceased.

The Parents’ Fund

Washington and Lee’s parents have for
many years supported the University in an
unusually generous manner. This generosity
has made the Washington and Lee Parents’
Program a model for other institutions and has
brought the University national recognition.

Under the direction of the Parents’ Ad-
visory Council, the Parents Fund nearly
doubled last year’s performance. In so doing,

Alumni Fund, 1967-68

The businesses listed below matched the gifts that their
employees made to Washington and Lee University during

they contributed a total of $15,626.33 to their employees’
alma mater. This “matching gift program” is an enlightened
approach taken by many American businesses in sharing

HE EYES OF TEXAS were upon

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity for seven days last July. At the
same time, a delegation of Uni-
versity officials headed by President
Robert E. R. Huntley looked upon
Texas. And often the gazes met in
wide-eyed wonder and mutual ad-
miration.

The “Texas Trip” as it became
known, was prompted by “Wash-
ington and Lee Day” on Friday,
July 12 at HemisFair in San An-
tonio. Washington and Lee was the
first out-of-Texas college to have
a special day at Texas’ first World’s
Fair. The planning began in Feb-
ruary, and, in the process, the visit
was expanded into a wide-ranging
trek rivaling the dimensions of
Texas itself.

President Huntley was accom-
panied by his wife, Evelyn; Dean
of the College W. W. Pusey, III,
and his wife, Marvy Hope (a native
of Texas); Director of Develop-
ment Frank A. Parsons and his
wife, Henny; and Alumni Secre-
tary William Washburn and his
wife, Libby. J. Stewart Buxton of
Memphis, Tenn., a University
trustee, and Mrs, Buxton were in
the official delegation. They were
joined in Texas by another trus-
tee, John Stemmons of Dallas, and
Mrs. Stemmons.

By the time the trip ended, the
Washington and Lee officials had
seen and talked with hundreds of
Washington and Lee alumni (there
are more than 600 in Texas),. had
deliberated with many of Texas’
leading citizens, toured many of
Texas’ monuments of dynamic
progress, and covered hundreds of
miles of Texas ground—San An-
tonio, Houston, Galveston, Dallas-
Fort Worth. The group returned
by way of Shreveport, La.

Washington and Lee had a spec-
ial “in’’ at HemisFair. Two of its
chief officers are alumni, Marshall
T’. Steves, 44, president and Tom
C. Frost, Jr. ‘50, vice president.
Brent C. Harnisch, *39, president
of the San Antonio alumni chap-
ter, was in charge of the arrange-
ments for the activities that at-
tracted more than 200 alumni,
wives, and guests from throughout
‘Texas and many other parts of the
nation.

“All praise should be given to
Brent Harnisch for his superb
leadership, direction, supervision,
and just general hard work to make
the event a truly wonderful time
for all,” Alumni Secretary Wash-
burn said. ‘Everything was beauti-
fully arranged, and everyone had
a great time.”

On the evening before the
HemisFair program, Mr. and Mrs.
Steves entertained President Hunt-
ley and visiting alumni at a party
at their home, a handsome place
that has received national atten-
tion in home-making magazines.

The Washington and Lee group
arrived at the fair grounds aboard
three barges that had first taken
them on a cruise on the San An-
tonio River. The HemisFair Band
played “The Swing” at a welcom-
ing ceremony. (One alumnus said
that the band was small, but in
that setting it sounded like the
Marine Band.)

At a luncheon in the Tower of
the Americas Restaurant, Mayor
Walter McAllister of San Antonio
made President Huntley an “Al-
calde.” That’s Mexican for mayor,

FALL 1968

 

and if President Huntley ever
moves to San Antonio he will, as
“Alcalde,” be exempt from city
taxes for a year. Mayor McAllister
also paid tribute to Mr. Steves for
his contributions to the success of
HemisFair. All of this took place
as the restaurant atop the 550-foot
Tower of the Americas revolved at
the rate of one revolution per hour.
The group had earlier visited the
U. S. Pavilion. After lunch, there
was a special tour of the Institute
of Texas Cultures, followed by
tours of HemisFair at leisure.
President Huntley was the prin-
cipal speaker at a banquet that
evening at the St. Anthony Hotel.
He was introduced by Mr. Frost.
President Huntley stressed the
strengths of the University as re-
flected in its faculty, its student
body, and its alumni and touched
on the University’s physical needs,
particularly in the area of physical
education facilities. He was given
a standing ovation when he ended

on the note: “I am convinced that
our greatest asset is the distinction
our alumni have brought to us...
We expect to let you know how
good you are, and we expect to
let you know how good we are,
and we expect to do it rather fre-
quently.”

The next day Mr. Huntley and
other Washington and Lee officials
were given a tour of Trinity Col-
lege in San Antonio by R. R. Witt,
‘13, and Trinity Dean Bruce Morse.
Mr. and Mrs. Frost entertained the
group at a dinner that evening
aboard one of the river barges.
The menu featured Mexican food.

The Huntleys and Washburns
moved on to Houston over the
weekend, and on Monday had a
full day of activity, including a
tour of Rice University and of the
Astrodome, a luncheon given by
Thomas D. Anderson, ’34, a recep-
tion for President and Mrs. Hunt-

The Huntleys and Washburns
spent the next two days in Dallas,
where they were guests of the
North Texas chapter, which in-
cludes Fort Worth. John Stemmons,
31, president of Industrial Pro-
perties, Inc., a firm that is reclaim-
ing vast areas in the old Trinity
River valley, took them on a tour
of the city and gave them a close
look at the industrial develop-
ments sponsored by his firm. In-
cluded were the Furniture Mart,
the Apparel Mart, and the Stem-
mons ‘Towers. Among the other
hosts were L. Storey Stemmons, ’27;
Maurice E. Purnell, Jr., ’61, Rich-
ard D. Haynes, ’58, and Clay J.
Berry, Jr. ’50. The activities in-
cluded lunch and golf at the Pres-
ton Trails Golf Course and a din-
ner at the Northwood Club given
by John and Storey Stemmons.

The next day President Huntley
was taken on visits to the offices of
several prominent Dallas business
men by Mr. Purnell and Mr.
Haynes; John Stemmons gave a
luncheon for the President at the
Chapparal Club attended by the
leading business and educational
leaders of Dallas.

The Dallas-Fort Worth reception
and dinner was held that night in
the Great Hall of the Apparel
Mart, with John Stemmons presid-
ing. Some 200 alumni and guests
attended.

The Great Hall is enormous, so
large that parakeets are allowed to
fly freely around inside. “There is
just no way to describe the place,”
Mr. Washburn said. This setting
and the enthusiasm for what Presi-
dent Huntley had to say about
Washington and Lee made a fitting
finale to the “Texas Trip’”—admir-
ing Washington and Lee eyes on
‘Texas and admiring Texas eyes on
Washington and Lee.

On the Soccer Fields of WEL

ACH FALL, as campuses
E everywhere get caught up
in the hurly-burly of collegi-
ate football, the exciting sport
of soccer somehow is forgot-
ten in favor of 50-yard runs,
crunching tackles, and crucial
third-down plays.

That need not be, especi-
ally at Washington and Lee
where Coach Joe Lyles has
built the Generals into prob-
ably the most successful team
the school has had in the last
nine years.

Since 1959, when Lyles was
appointed to the _ athletic
stafl, Washington and Lee
soccer teams have enjoyed
winning seasons, com-
piling an over-all 65-36-7
record. ‘There was a_break-
even (6-6) mark in 1960, and
cause was a

seven

the only losing
later (3-8).

In 1964, the Generals were
selected to play in the NCAA

year

Eastern Regionals, thanks to
an 8-2-1 regular season record.
After an opening-game 2-0
win over Norwich Academy,
Washington and Lee finally
lost, 1-0, in double overtime
to the Coast Guard Academy
in the championship game.
Last year, Lyles’ team capped
a fine g-3-1 season by taking
the Virginia Invitational Soc-
cer Tournament champion-
ship, 3-0, from Eastern Men-
nonite College.

An M.A. graduate of
Springfield College, Lyles is
every bit the reason for soccer
success at the University. He
is a tough and determined
coach, and he has recognized
the fact he must push his soc-
cer program if it is to compete
in popularity and acceptance

with football.

“We work hard,” says
Lyles, “because we have to.
It is very rare that we'll get

 

a natural talent here, so we
have to make them. That’s
why I stress conditioning,
dedication, and desire.”’

Lyles takes a_ professional
approach to coaching. He has
played professional baseball
and basketball, baseball with
the St. Louis Browns, and
basketball against the Harlem
Globetrotters during a 1952
tour that touched 48 coun-
tries. He got his soccer train-
ing in the tough St. Louis
municipal leagues, a hotbed
of the sport in the United
States.

So there is little doubt the
Generals will ever suffer too
much as long as Lyles con-
tinues to guide Washington
and Lee’s soccer program.
The record speaks for itself,

a better one than... what's
that other sport... football?
