A Visit with
Wiillham Humphrey

Washington and Lee’s Glasgow Professor
‘Talks About His Work and Plans for the Future;
His New Novel Was Completed During His

‘T’wo-Semester Residence at the University

N AMERICAN writer whose first
A novel received wide critical
praise and was later made into a
successful movie, has completed
his second novel at Washington
and Lee University.

William Humphrey, author of
Home From the Hill, was Glasgow
Visiting Professor the first semester
of the current academic year and
stayed on in Lexington the second
semester ‘““because we liked the
place and I didn’t want to inter-
rupt my work right now.”

Seated in the living room of
“Rose Hill,” a hilltop farmhouse
just outside Lexington, where
Humphrey and his wife have been
living, he said when he arrived in
September he had set for himself
a deadline for completing the nov-
el which had been in progress for
several years.

“Im a very slow, painstaking
writer,” he said, ‘‘and it does get
very hard at times, so when I was
coming near the end of the book,
it was like looking down a tunnel
where you can see a very faint glim-

93

mer.

While staying at Washington
and Lee, the glimmer became a full
light because he finished the book
March 2, six weeks ahead of the
deadline he had established for
himself. “I suppose I wrote about
75 pages here which for me is a
fantastic amount. I never wrote so
fast,” he said. |

‘The book has been accepted for
publication both in New York and
London in January, 1965, and a
long episode has been sold to the
Saturday Evening Post for publi-
cation this fall.

Originally the book was titled
“Look Away, Look Away,” but just
recently Humphrey’s publishers
discovered another book being re-
leased soon that has that title.

“This was a very great blow,” he
said, ‘and I’ve spent lots of time
searching for another satisfactory
one.”

But students and faculty at
Washington and Lee have already
heard portions of the first novel he
has written since Home From the
Hill. He devoted all of the last of
the four lectures he gave the first

Services

semester to reading part of the book
to an enthralled audience.

Humphrey explained that as
Glasgow Visiting Professor, his
main duty “was those four lectures
and even the subject of them was
left entirely up to me.”

In determining the subjects of
the addresses, he said he ‘‘ruled out
a series of interrelated lectures be-
cause you have to spend too much
time repeating what you had said
in previous talks in the series.”

So he decided to do what he
thought most people would do—
“talk about the things that mean
the most to you, the things you are
thinking about.”

His first lecture was “Ah, Wilder-
ness’ in which he discussed how
novelists have “decried the advance
of civilization on the wilderness.”
Humphrey revealed he “read 3,500
pages of James Fenimore Cooper to
spend five minutes talking about
him in that lecture.”

The second lecture defined the
conventions of telling a story by
voice and writing down a story, “I
suggested there’s a small class of

novelists still using the conven-
tions of the spoken story in writ-
ten form,’ Humphrey said.

Flaubert and Tolstoy as_histori-
cal novelists were discussed in the
third lecture and the fourth was
given over to reading the long ex-
cerpt from the new novel complet-
ed while in residence at Washing-
ton and Lee.

Humphrey sat in on “about a
half dozen meetings” of Dr. R. CG.
MacDonald’s creative writing class.
“IT listened to the boys read their
stories and offered my comments,’
he said.

His own comment on what he
heard in that class: “The progress
of almost every student was remark-
able. I saw their stories from the
first of the semester to the last and
they certainly compared favorably
with what I saw in classes I used to
teach.” Humphrey was a member
of the Bard College faculty for
nine years.

Humphrey said the students he
observed in the creative writing
class, like many college students,
“don’t have enough experience to
know what is usable in fiction.”

“T did find them remarkably ma-
ture in accepting criticism of their
stories from Dr. MacDonald and
from each other,” he said.

Humphrey also gave lectures in
several advanced English classes
and said he was pleased to find the
students did not stand in awe of
him because he was a well-known
writer. Humphrey said he was very
pleased “none of them asked me
such questions as: “Do you write
with a pencil or a typewriter?’ or
‘What should a person who wants
to be a writer do—teach English or
sling hash?’ ”’

Humphrey has a very simple an-
swer for the question of what led
him into full-time writing. “I had
enough of a success with Home
Irom the Hill to give up teaching
and give full time to writing.”’

‘The year at Washington and Lee

was the first time Humphrey had
lived in the South in twenty years,
although he was born in Texas and
attended Southern Methodist Uni-
versity and the University of Texas.

“After being away from. the
South so long, my accent had start-
ed to clear up,” he said, “but it’s
beginning to thicken again. My
wife even has trouble understand-
ing me now.”

The Humphreys enjoyed their
stay at Lexington. “My wife and
I have just fallen in love with the
landscape here. It’s one of the most
beautiful places I’ve seen.” The
couple often went for long walks
across the fields around “Rose
Hill” to enjoy the scenery.

‘The South, particularly ‘Texas, is
the setting for both Home Irom
the Hill and the novel just com-
pleted. Asked why he wrote about
the region if he hadn’t lived there
for so long, Humphrey answered:
“It’s like being a Jew, you never get
over it.

“The writer who is a Southerner
is blessed because things happened
here with a finality and a violence
that is a gold mine for a writer.
But the South as literature is get-
ting like these fields out here—used
up,” he said, pointing out the win-
dow to the fields he has walked over
so often this year.

But he believes there is still
something left in the South for the
fiction writer.

Right now nothing particular
that he observed during his stay at
Washington and Lee seems to be
usable in his writing, but he point-
ed out he can easily lapse into an

accent with people and he did this

with some who came to make deliv-
erles at his house. “I’ve heard a
lot of good anecdotes that you real-
ly can’t miss hearing and_ they
might be useful some time. You
never can. tell.”

This quiet, soft-spoken man who
wears a blue work shirt and cor-
duroy pants around his house—and

what he calls his “Professor Hig-
gins” hat when he goes for a walk—
said about the only way to describe
how he felt when he finished a
book was “‘scared.

“You're not scared that the pub-
lishers will turn it down or of what
the reviewers will say, but it’s so
much a part of you, you’ve lived
with it so long, you can’t judge it.

“When you have it in the house
so long and then send it away, it’s
like a growth was cut off. You feel
relieved—and naked.”

Humphrey pointed to the manu-
script of the new novel on _ the
table beside him and _ said _ he
was making the final changes and
corrections before it went to the
publisher. “I know some parts just
aren't right, but finally you reach
a point where you just have to stop,
to cut it off, just quit and hope.”

Neither could he define exactly
what makes a book a success. ‘‘Sure
you have a structure. You know
what you want to get down on pa-
per when you begin but ten pages
later, it’s all shot to hell. You just
know a certain passage is right or
it isn’t. There aren’t any real rules
for success,” he said.

And what comes next? “One
reason I’ve been so long writing
this book,” he said, “is because
I have two other novels and a book
of short stories going.

“IT don’t know, I suppose TU
turn to one of the novels, but may-
be the short stories. ‘That was what
I did first and is my first love.”

Humphrey and his wife will be
going to England for the summer,
taking with them many fond mem-
ories of their year at Washington
and Lee.

And certainly Lexington and
Washington and Lee will remem-
ber them fondly and be watching
for the new book eagerly. Someday,
perhaps, there may be a setting or
character from the University in
some future work of one of the
country’s most promising writers.

ODK
Celebrates
Its Golden

Anniversary

National Leadership Society Returns ‘To
the Place of Its Founding to Pay Hom-
age to Six Surviving Members Who Gave
Birth to the Lofty “ODK Idea”

SPRING 1964

N THE CAMPUSES of one hundred and eleven Amer-
() ican colleges and universities, membership in
Omicron Delta Kappa is an honor often second only to
Phi Beta Kappa as a mark of collegiate achievement.
On some of these campuses, because ODK emphasizes
qualities of leadership and campus citizenship as well
as good scholarship, the ODK key is worn more proud-
ly than that of the oldest of college fraternal organi-
zations.

In the half century since ODK’s founding, some
40,000 men have been tapped for membership in “the
laurel-crowned circle” of the society. But none covet
their selection more than the 933 Washington and Lee
men who belong or have belonged to the Alpha Circle
of the university where Omicron Delta Kappa was
founded fifty years ago.

This year, in recognition of the Golden Anniver-
sary of the national honorary leadership society, Omi-
cron Delta Kappa held its national convention in Roa-
noke on April 23-25. Highlight of the event was an all-
day pilgrimage by the 250 delegates to Washington
and Lee for ceremonies commemorating the founding
and honoring the founders.

Of the fifteen original members of the Alpha Cir-
cle, six survive, and of these, four were able to at-

5

tend the anniversary convocation at
Washington and Lee. Dr. William
Brown, °14, of St. Petersburg, Fla.,
and Carl S. Davidson, ’15, of York,
Pa., were absent because of poor
health, but Thomas M. Glasgow,
"16L, came from Charlotte, N. C.,
Dr. James E. Bear, ’15, came from
Richmond, and Willam C. Raftery,
"16, came from Ashland, Va. And,
of course, there was Prof. Rupert
N. Latture, ’15, professor emeritus
of his University, who has spent
most of his 72 years in Lexington
and at Washington and Lee.

When ODK men speak of the
purpose of their society, they refer
often to the “ODK idea.” It is, ac-
tually, a threefold statement of pur-
pose:

“First, to recognize men who
have attained a high standard of
efficiency in collegiate activities
and to inspire in others to strive
for conspicuous attainments along
similar lines;

“Second, to bring together the
most representative men in all
phases of collegiate life and thus
to create an organization which
will help to mould the sentiment
of the institution on questions
of local and intercollegiate inter-
est;

“Third, to bring together mem-
bers of the faculty and the student
body of the institution on a basis
of mutual interest and under-
standing.”

In their first thoughts of a society
which would recognize campus
leadership, the founders perhaps
did not state their purposes so pre-
cisely, but the ODK idea began as
just that, an idea that took shape
from the conversations of two col-

lege roommates, Rupert Latture
and the late J. Carl Fisher, both of
them student instructors at Wash-
ington and Lee in 1914. Later, one
evening following a meeting of the

Graham-Lee Literary Society, the

 

two brought another student 1n-
structor, Bill Brown, into the dis-
cussion. ‘here, on the steps in
Washington Hall where they sat
talking, the idea became a work-
ing plan. Other student leaders
were involved, as were a _ select
eroup of faculty, and on Decem-
ber 3, 1914, the Alpha Circle was
founded with fifteen members.

In addition to those already men-
tioned, the founders included Pres-
ident Henry Louis Smith, Prof. De
la Warr Benjamin Easter, Prof. Da-
vid Carlisle Humphreys, Edward
Parks Davis, Edward A. Donahue,
Philip P. Gibson, John E. Martin,
and John P. Richardson, Jr.

Nothing at the start suggested
a nationwide growth of the society,
but the idea was a good one, boost-
ed at Johns Hopkins by Dr. Robert
W. Dickey, ’11, and other Wash-
ington and Lee students in gradu-
ate school there, and at Pittsburgh
through the debate team which
visited Lexington and carried the

 

E'xcerpts from Speeches by Presidents Cole and Shannon

“IT want you to know that the conditions
which gave rise to the ODK idea still exist in
dynamic ways at the place of tts founding. They
exist because our students respond to the inspira-
tion of ODK and Washington and Lee. And they
exist, too, because our students have the privi-
lege and honor of knowing personally one of the
founders, Professor Rupert Latture.

“My friendship with Professor Latture is a
privilege that I shall treasure always, for I can
see in his life of service to Washington and Lee
the fibre and character of the fraternity he
helped establish.

“The qualities of leadership can be found in
men of greatly diverse temperament and atti-
tudes. Where some may lead by exhortations of
strong words or spectacular deeds, others inspire
their fellowmen by the example of their every-
day confrontation of life. Professor Latture, to
me, isa signal example of how a man can extend
his influence to others through a life of quiet
leadership and service.”

—President Cole

“For a national society uniting leadership
and honor, Robert E. Lee stands as the noblest
embodiment of these two concepts. By defini-
tion, leadership means guiding or conducting—
showing the way. A leader ts ‘a person who goes
before the guide. To be a leader, therefore, one
has to be ahead of the crowd; one has to be in
the forefront, whether in ideas, ideals, or actions;
and in going before to guide, a leader has to be-
lieve in his own knowledge of the way and in the
validity of the goal to be achieved. In other
words, leadership requires vision; and genuine
leadership involves unselfishness and responsi-
bility. Honor is respect given to worth. It is an-
other word for nobility of character, for abso-
lute integrity in word and deed. Honor also car-
ries a strong connotation of obligation; so that
leadership and honor join, through the wmpli-
cations of responsibility and obligation, in the
idea of service, which is labor for the benefit of
others. By leadership, honor, and service, we jus-
tify the Laurel Crowned Circle of our motto.”

—President Shannon

idea back to the North. Davidson
College was an early applicant for
a charter.

‘This year, shortly before the op-
ening of the Golden Anniversary
Convention, Erskine College in
Due West, S.C., (the late President
Gaines’ birthplace) became the
111th college circle chartered. ‘The
University of Hawaii circle was
chartered in 1955.

‘The 50th Anniversary conven-
tion program was impressive. Secre-
tary of State Dean Rusk, who was
once president of the Davidson Col-
lege circle as an undergraduate, was
scheduled to address the opening
convocation at Hotel Roanoke, Ap-
ril 23, but a White House confer-
ence interfered. Instead, delegates
heard a major policy statement on
Cuba from the State Department's
No. 2 man, Undersecretary of State
George W. Ball.

When the convention moved to
Lexington the next day, the sched-
ule was tight. Delegates saw the
campuses of Virginia Military In-
stitute and Washington and Lee,
attended a reception at the home of
President and Mrs. Cole, posed for
the official anniversary photograph
before Washington Hall, and then
gathered in Evans Hall for lunch-
eon, a concert by the Glee Club,
and an address by President Cole.

Delegates went to province meet-
ings after lunch, then reassembled
in Lee Chapel for a special pro-
eram of recognition for the found-
ers and a model initiation cere-
mony. With student officers of the
Alpha Circle in charge, three new
members were taken into the “lau-
rel-crowned circle’ of ODK. Ed-
ward J. Dinkel, ’64L, was initiated
into the Washington and Lee cir-
cle, while Virginia ‘Tech’s circle
honored ‘Tech’s own Sydner Hum-
mer Byrne and a Washington and
Lee alumnus, Edward H. Ould, ’29,
president of Roanoke’s First Na-
tional Exchange Bank.

Speaker at the Lee Chapel meet-
ing was President Edgar F. Shan-

SPRING 1964

   

RoBert W. Dickey, 10, THomAs M. GLascow, ’16L, and DEAN C. J. Gray of Richmond.

non, Jr., of the University of Vir-
ginia, who was tapped for ODK
membership when an undergradu-
ate at Washington and Lee in 19309.

Back in Roanoke that evening,
delegates at the banquet heard an
illustrated talk by Barry C. Bishop,
secretary of the National Geograph-
ics committee for research and ex-
ploration. The son of the ODK
General Council’s secretary, Dean
Robert W. Bishop of the Univer-
sity of Cincinnati, Bishop talked
about and showed color slides of
the American 1963 expedition to
Mt. Everest. Bishop himself was
one of six who reached the sum-
mit of the world’s loftiest moun-
tain.

On the convention’s final day,
Dean Bishop, who had served twen-
ty-seven years as ODK secretary and
editor of its journal, was elected na-
tional president, succeeding Presi-
dent G. Herbert Smith of Willam-
ette University, Salem, Ore.

No one enjoyed the convention

 

UNDERSECRETARY GEORGE BALL

more than did Professor Latture.
For him, it was three days of fulfill-
ment, of deserved tribute from the
General Council, the convention at
large, from President Cole and
President Shannon. President
Smith urged undergraduate dele-
gates to seek him out and meet the
man who shared first the ODK
idea.

But perhaps the most meaningful
gesture for Professor Latture came
in an unplanned way. From some-
where in the 111 circles had come
a request for a society coat of arms
to be designed. ‘The request had
sufficient backing to cause the na-
tional headquarters to commission
an artist to prepare a design. It
was on display, in its heraldic fin-
ery, at the final session. ‘The com-
mittee in charge recommended that
it not be accepted, but opposition
to the motion was expected.

It never came. Also on display
was a beautifully polished six-foot
mahogany replica of the simple
ODK Key, recently fashioned and
brought to the convention by the
Georgia Tech circle. One by one
delegates rose to denounce the need
for a coat of arms when “the key we
all love,’’ as one put it, serves every
purpose that a crest might.

‘The vote to forget about coats of
arms was unanimous, and Profes-
sor Latture smiled quietly. “This
was the most gratifying tribute of
all, for he had designed the ODK
key himself fifty years ago in phil-
osophy class at Washington and
Lee.

 

A Changing Pattern Characterizes

“Religious Emphasis’ at the University

NE OF THE MOST significant de-
C) velopments in this century in
the field of religion has been the
renewed attempt to relate religious
faith meaningfully to the daily life
of men. On college campuses these
efforts have produced such _ pro-
erams as “Religious Emphasis
Weeks” and other types of religious
conferences. Since the spring of
1961 an important experiment has
been underway at Washington and
Lee, an experiment which now
seems to merit some attention and
evaluation.

Washington and Lee since its
earliest days has acknowledged of-
ficially the importance of the Chris-
tian faith to our civilization. ‘The
University continues to recognize
“the Christian ideal” as one of the
two “enduring adherences” of this
institution, the other being our de-
dication to the democratic form of
social organization. The first by-
law of the University makes it quite
clear that Washington and Lee re-
jects any form of sectarian domina-
tion while accepting Christianity
and its ideals.

Part of the tangible expression of
this “enduring adherence” of the
University is the support of the
University Christian Association
and its various programs for ac-
quainting students with Christian
principles and ideals. While the
U.C.A. operates in a number of

8

Assistant Professor of Religion

areas of student life, the lion’s share
of its financial resources and effort
is used to invite leaders from out-
side the University to deal with
timely topics from a religious point
of view.

Until the mid-fifties the specific
structure for accomplishing that
end was the annual “Religious
Emphasis Week.” During “REW”
a number of speakers were brought
to campus to provide inspiration
and education along religious lines.
The program of the week, usually
about three days in fact, was begun
with a compulsory assembly of the
entire student body in the gymna-
sium for the first of three addresses
by the major speaker. ‘This was or-
dinarily followed by meetings of
small groups with the several lead-
ers for informal conversation on
topics related to the central theme
of the week. Classes were opened
to the guests who spoke and led
discussions on religious subjects.
The same basic program was main-
tained through the fall of 1961,
though under a new name for the
last several years, as the ‘“Univer-
sity Religious Conference.”

Several weaknesses in the very
structure of Religious Emphasis
Week, or University Religious
Conference, became apparent as the
program began to lose its effective-
ness. For one thing, the gymnasium
packed with a “captive” audience

proved to be an unsuitable environ-
ment for either education or inspi-
ration. Another key problem was
that the entire religious program
was compressed into one brief per-
iod and consequently largely for-
gotten for the remainder of the
year. Still another difficulty was that
the full year’s program collapsed
if one conference proved not to
measure up to expectations. Better
ways of meeting the University’s
self-designated responsibility — for
student religious life had to be
sought.

In the spring of 1961 the cabi-
net of the University Christian As-
sociation and the Faculty Commit-
tee on Christian Work approved
in principle several experimental
modifications of the program. The
new program was labeled ‘Semi-
nars in Religion,’ a name inspired
by the already established ‘Semi-
nars in Literature.” Under the new
system three smaller conferences,
each of two days’ duration, replaced
the one three-day Religious Empha-
sis Week. In a typical Seminar one
guest lecturer is invited to give two
public lectures and to meet select-
ed classes in the Department of Re-
ligion and in the co-sponsoring de-
partment. The guest is urged to

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

This change in policy has allowed
a number of advantages, not the
least of which is that it provides for
a more comprehensive program of
religious activity to keep the Chris-
tian ideal more constantly in mind.
It likewise made it possible to deal
with several topics during the year
and thus to widen the base of ap-
peal and interest to students. ‘The
eratifying result has been that more
student interests have been touched.

Another shift in policy is _per-
haps more far-reaching than the
breaking down of the one annual
session into three smaller confer-
ences. ‘The Seminars in Religion
are specifically aimed at relating
religious faith meaningfully to life
by stimulating significant dialogue
between the Christian faith and the
various academic disciplines in the
University. Each Seminar is thus
sponsored by the University Chris-
tian Association, the Department of
Religion, and one other depart-
ment within the University. ‘This
specific purpose, incidentally, grows
out of the conviction that the mod-
ern university all too often becomes
a multiversity in which several le-
gitimate but circumscribed  ap-
proaches are made to the same
problems of humanity. Thus the
Seminars program is also related to
distant rumblings in the academic
world which promise for the future
a larger quest for the unity of
human knowledge.

In order to stimulate this kind
of dialogue between Christianity
and other fields of learning the
Seminars in Religion bring to cam-
pus speakers who are not only rec-
ognized authorities in their special
discipline but who also understand
basic Christianity and its relation
to that discipline. Since the spring
of 1961 Seminars have been con-
ducted in six fields—English, eco-
nomics, psychology, sociology, bi-
ology, and law. Chairmen in these
and other departments have enter-
ed the program with enthusiasm.

SPRING 1964

Most recently the Student Bar
Association in the Law _ School
joined with the Christian Associa-
tion and the Department of Re-
ligion in sponsoring a “Seminar in
Religion and Law” with Professor
Samuel E. Stumpf of Vanderbilt
University speaking on “The Moral
Order and the Legal Order.”

The final value of any such en-
terprise at a University is to be de-
termined, of course, by the quality
of the ideas expressed and the in-
terest developed by the partici-
pants. On both these criteria the
Seminars have shown real promise.
In one of the earliest Seminars, for
example, Dr. William R. Mueller
of Goucher College traced interests
and themes in several contemporary
writers which parallel the tradition-
al interests of Christian theology.
He developed the thesis that while
modern writers are seldom as con-
sciously and deliberately Biblical as
a man like John Bunyan _ they
nevertheless are occupied with the
same human concerns found in
Biblical literature. In this connec-
tion he dealt with selected works
of Dostoevski, Graham Greene, and
Camus, among others.

J. Kenneth Morland, Chairman
of the Department of Sociology and
Anthropology at Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College, dealt with one
of the most pressing problems in
contemporary religion, “Moral Rel-
ativism and Religious Faith.” Dr.
Morland showed how differences
between cultures on rules of human
conduct—e.g., we would feel guilty
about having more than one wite
whereas in some _ societies men
would feel guilty if they did not—
raise important questions for the
Christian. ‘These lectures served to
highlight the perennial problem
relating sociological and_ theolog1-
cal approaches to moral principles.

Samuel E. Stumpf, Chairman of
the Department of Philosophy at
Vanderbilt, developed the thesis
that the system of laws in a society

is properly to be regarded as the
“arm of morality.” Laws of a so-
ciety are tangible expressions of the
goals or “moral” ends which that
society seeks. Dr. Stumpf then
traced backward from laws to mor-
als to theology in an order of logi-
cal priority. ‘The ethical goals of
a society reflect and grow out of
that society’s view of ultimate re-
ality of “god.” ‘These goals, in turn,
mold the laws by which conduct 1s
regulated. So it is that religion and
law are directly linked by systems
of morality.

One of the more exciting semi-
nars was led by Dr. Ralph T. Over-
man, a nuclear physicist and active
Christian layman at Oak Ridge.
In a “Seminar in Religion and Bi-
ology” on the subject of “Religion
and Science’ Dr. Overman deliv-
ered two lectures under the titles
‘““A Christian Looks at Science” and
“A Scientist Looks at Christianity.”
The thesis in these lectures was
that we come to know what we
know in science in basically the
same way that we come to know
what we know in religion. Scien-
tists take the data of experience and
fit them together into useful mental
constructs which show why things
behave as they do. The theologian
does the same thing except that his
data concern the personal or spirit-
ual side of man rather than the
physical world. ‘Thus, Overman
concluded, since the scientist and
the theologian share the same ap-
proach or method there is no rea-
son for them to be quarrelsome or
at odds with each other. Neither
is inherently more respectable or
authentic than the other.

Such ideas as these have proved
immensely stimulating to those who
participate in the Seminars. ‘he
present plan is to continue this
basic approach in religion on cam-
pus. It has thus far proved to be
one very valuable way in which
Washington and Lee can express
its “enduring adherence’ to the
Christian ideal.

Renovation of Reid Hall as a Home

For Journalism and Communications

Will Be Completed for September Use

HE REMODELING Of Reid Hall as
1 a new home for Washington
and Lee University’s Department
of Journalism and Communica-
tions is nearly complete.

D. E. Brady, Jr., the university’s
Superintendent of Buildings and
Grounds, said the construction
work is on schedule. Plans call for
the department to move into its
new quarters during the summer.
The facilities will go into use at
the beginning of the 1964-65 aca-
demic year.

Located behind the group of
buildings forming the university’s
well-known colonnade, Reid Hall
was constructed in 1904. The phys-
ics department formerly occupied
the structure until moving into
Washington and Lee’s new science
building last year.

Renovation of Reid Hall for the
journalism department began in
October, 1963. When completed it
will provide modern and complete
facilities for the academic program
of the department as well as for
laboratories for newspaper proce-
dures, advertising, radio and tele-
vision, photography, public rela-
tions, and motion picture produc-
tion.

O. W. Riegel, department chair-
man, said instruction puts major
emphasis on academic study of the
subject, reflecting the university’s

10

liberal arts tradition. He said the
heart of the department’s new fa-
cilities will be the second floor of
Reid Hall which will contain class-
rooms, library, seminar room, and
offices.

A classroom seating approximate-
ly 100 students will take up one
whole side of the second floor. Seats
will be arranged on elevated tiers
facing a lecture platform. A_pro-
jection booth is being installed in
the rear. A special sound system
will permit radio programs pro-
duced in third floor studios to be
piped into the classroom or lectures
given in the room can be recorded
in a control booth on the third
floor.

The library on the second floor
will house the department’s collec-
tion of books, periodicals, and
newspapers, as well as historical and
other archive material. Other sec-
ond floor facilities will include fac-
ulty offices, a seminar room, a stu-
dent lounge, and a film storage and
editing room.

Riegel said the department also
recognizes that students need prac-
tical experience in journalism and
communications and pointed out
the first and third floors are being
equipped to meet this requirement.

Three sound-proofed, air-condi-
tioned broadcasting studios of vary-

ing sizes will take up half of the
third floor. One control room will
serve all three studios and have
windows opening into each of
them.

Broadcasting facilities will be
used by students taking the depart-
ment’s radio and television courses.
Also programs on Radio Washing-
ton and Lee and Home Edition—
its daily 15-minute news broad-
cast—will originate here. ‘These pro-
grams are broadcast over the Lex-
ington radio station, WREL.

A room patterned after a news-
paper newsroom will occupy the
other side of the third floor. It will
be equipped with typewriter desks
and a semi-circular copy desk. Stu-
dents interested in newspaper writ-
ing and editing will use these fa-
cilities. ‘(Two Associated Press tele-
types will be installed in a separate
room nearby to serve both the news-
room and the broadcasting studios.

Other third floor facilities will
include a tape storage and editing
room, a phonograph record storage
room, a newsroom for Home Fdi-
tion, an advertising laboratory and
drafting room, and faculty offices.

Up under the eaves of the fourth
floor will be a photographic labora-
tory with separate rooms for devel-
oping and printing.

The first floor of Reid Hall will
house the Journalism Laboratory

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

Press now in a small separate build-
ing on campus. In its new location
there will be separate composing,
linotype and press rooms. Windows
in each of these rooms will be
bricked up, isolating noise from
other parts of the building and
campus. Other first floor rooms wiil
include storage space, offices, maui
room and workroom with a sepa-
rate entrance for staffers of the
Ring-tum Phi, student newspaper.

A group of newspaper and broad-
casting executives has served as an
advisory committee to the journal-
ism department in planning the
new facilities.

They are: M. W. Armistead, III,
president of the ‘Times-World Cor-
poration, Roanoke, Va.; ‘Thomas
R. Glass, vice president of the
Lynchburg News and the Lynch-

Babcock S Wilcox Company Helps

University Nuclear Science Program

XECUTIVES Of the Babcock & Wil-
H cox Company’s Atomic Energy
Division and instructors of Wash-
ington and Lee University’s new
nuclear physics course met early
this semester to discuss current de-
velopments in their field.

R. H. Harrison, vice-president of
The Atomic Energy Division of
B&W and John W. Landis, manag-
er of the division located in Lynch-
burg, climaxed a February visit to
Washington and Lee with a look
at the university’s new nuclear
physics laboratory.

A nuclear physics course was of-
fered for the first time this semes-
ter at Washington and Lee _ for
eight senior majors. Equipment for
the course’s laboratory was _ pur-
chased with a recent $15,000 grant
from the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion.

Showing the B&W officials the
new equipment and explaining the
new course was Dr. Edward F.
Turner, Jr., chairman of Washing-
ton and Lee’s physics department
and William B. Newbolt, who
teaches the nuclear physics course.

Earlier in the visit, Harrison and
Landis gave Washington and Lee
President Fred C. Cole ideas and
suggestions for the new physics
course and other nuclear physics
instruction which might be offered.

Harrison and Landis met other
members of Washington and Lee’s
science faculty at a luncheon in
their honor at the University’s
Evans Dining Hall. The visitors
also toured the campus and made
a thorough inspection of Wash-
ington and Lee’s science facilities
including the new science build-
ing now in its second year of use.

The meeting was another step
in a working relationship between
Babcock & Wilson and Washing-
ton and Lee. Earlier this year phys-
ics students and faculty visited
B&W’s facilities in Lynchburg and
met the company’s scientists and
engineers. BkW’s Nuclear Develop-
ment Center determined the hydro-
gen content of ‘Ti-Ni specimens for
Washington and Lee’s physics de-
partment. ‘The equipment to per-
form the analysis is currently be-
yond Washington and Lee’s budget.

Three Star
Football Men

OACH LEE McLaughlin believes
C his 1963 first unit line may
have been the “smartest” college
football forewall in the nation.

‘Three of his first stringers—end
Buck Ogilvie, Shreveport,  La.;
tackle Jim Sylvester, Las Vegas,
Nev.; and guard Bill Angel, Hunt-
ington, W. Va.—have been initiat-
ed into Washington and Lee’s chap-
ter of Phi Beta Kappa, national
scholastic honor society.

All three earned three varsity
football letters apiece, the last two
seasons as members of the Gen-
erals’ first unit. Ogilvie and Sylves-
ter were named to the Associated
Press All-Virginia small college first
team, as well as to the all-star team
of the College Athletic Conference.

“T think it’s remarkable to have
had three outstanding scholar-ath-
letes playing alongside each other
in the same line,” says McLaughlin.
“T doubt if any other college in the
country could boast three Phi Beta
Kappa boys on their entire squad,
let alone their starting team.”

Ogilvie is a mathematics major
who will attend graduate school at
Massachusetts Institute of ‘lech-
nology. Sylvester did  pre-med-
ical work at Washington and Lee
and will study medicine at Stan-
ford University. Angel majored in
contemporary civilization and will
study next year at the Graduate
School for English-speaking Stu-
dents at the University of Stock-
holm in Sweden.

The football record they helped
compile is almost as impressive as
their academic credentials. In their
three years of varsity play, the Gen-
erals won 22, lost only 4.

Verne Canfield Is Selected
As Head Basketball Coach

ASHINGTON AND LEE University
/ has named Verne Canfield, 31,
as head basketball coach to succeed
Bob McHenry whose resignation
was announced earlier this year.
For the past six years, Canfield
has been a highly successful head
basketball coach at Groveton High
School in Alexandria, the same
community in northern Virginia
where Washington and Lee turned
in 1957 to find its head football
coach, Lee McLaughlin. Because
Canfield joins the Washington and
Lee faculty as an assistant professor
of physical education, his appoint-
ment was announced by Dean of
the College William W. Pusey, III.
Athletic Director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly said Canfield also will
become tennis coach at Washing-
ton and Lee, succeeding William C.
Washburn, the university’s alumni
secretary who has handled the ten-
nis team with success for six years.
Twombly also announced that

Dana Swan, the Generals’ freshman
football coach and assistant lacrosse
coach, will become head _ lacrosse
coach in 1965. McHenry, who will
go to Lebanon Valley College as
head basketball coach next year,
has coached both basketball and
lacrosse at Washington and Lee
since 1958-59.

Canfield is a native of Rosemead,
Calif., and a B.A. graduate of the
University of California at Santa
Barbara College. He holds an M.A.
degree from George Washington
University and is currently working
toward another advanced degree.

In his six years at Groveton Can-
field’s teams won 78, lost 40, and he
never experienced a losing season.
His best years were in 1961-62 and
1962-63 when the Tigers compiled
records of 17-3 and 16-3. Last season
the mark was 12-7.

Canfield also coached freshman
basketball and track at Santa Bar-

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

—*

bara in 1954-55, before beginning a
two-year period of Army service.
In addition to his basketball work
at Groveton, Canfield coached ten-
nis, taught physical education, as-
sisted in track and football, directed
intramurals and acted as a guidance
counselor. He is married and has
an 18-month-old child.

‘Twombly said Canfield “has real
enthusiasm” about the basketball

 

VERNE CANFIELD

job at Washington and Lee. “We
got one crackerjack coach out of
northern Virginia when we brought
Lee McLaughlin here from Episco-
pal High School, and I hope we're
going to do it again,” ‘Twombly
said,

Canfield is heir to a basketball
program at Washington and Lee
that has produced only 27 victories
against 65 losses in six seasons. His
record at Groveton suggests he pos-
sesses remarkable curative powers.
A relatively new school, Groveton
had records of 3-13 and 1-15 before
Canfield took over in 1958. His first
team was 10-8 for the year, the few-
est number of victories any of his
Tiger teams were to produce.

Canfield says he is “looking for-
ward to helping build up the bas-
ketball program at Washington
and Lee University.”

SPRING 1964

The General Reunion of 64

Is Expected ‘To Bring Many

Alumni Back to Lexington

LARGE NUMBER of alumni, their

wives and families, some with
pleasant memories of the 1959 Gen-
eral Reunion, have indicated their
plans to be “back for more in ’64.”
The 1964 General Reunion on
June 11-13 will mark the fourth
time since 1949 that an “all classes”
reunion has been held.

A full program has been plan-
ned. Included will be special ban-
quets for the fiftieth, fortieth, twen-
ty-fifth, and tenth anniversary clas-
ses. These classes normally hold
their class reunions in May, but are
joining with the general reunion to
make it one of the outstanding
events in the Alumni Association’s
history. Many alumni will have
their first occasion to meet and

erect President and Mrs. Cole who
came to the University just follow-
ing the reunion of 1959. On view
will be many changes which have
taken place in the physical growth
of the University, highlighted by
Evans Dining Hall, the new dormi-
tories, new science and journalism
facilities, and the beautifully re-
stored Lee Chapel.

The reunion program is designed
to give time for relaxation; activi-
ties are varied and_ incorporate
events for the young and the “not
so young.” The anniversary class
banquets will be held Thursday.
The principal speaker for the con-
vocation on Friday will be Dr. Har-
ry Philpott, ’38, vice-president of
the University of Florida.

 

 

Annual Alumni Meeting on June 13

mu ANOTHER FEATURE of the General Reunion will be the annual
meeting of the Washington and Lee Alumni Association in Lee
Chapel on Saturday morning, June 13. All alumni are urged to
attend and take part in this meeting. The newly renovated Lee
Chapel is air conditioned and the results of the restoration will
be of added interest to alumni.

The annual meeting is provided for under the Association’s
charter and by-laws and is generally devoted to reports by officers
of the past year’s activities, and some of the special projects on
tap for the near future. Election of three new members to the
Alumni Board of ‘Trustees will be held, as well as the election
of the alumni representative to the University Committee on
Intercollegiate Athletics. ‘The report of the nominating committee
as prescribed by the by-laws is shown on page 19.

Regional Agents Begin
Home Stretch Drive
For the 1963-64 Fund

By WILLIAM C. WASHBURN
Alumni Secretary

HE COMPANION program to the
T class agent plan is getting un-
der way in over eighty regions and
communities. Where the class agent
has contacted the alumni on his
academic or law class roll by mail,
the regional agent, to supplement
this program, will call personally,
almost neighborly, on each alum-
nus within his community who has
not yet responded to the 1963-64
Alumni Fund campaign. The two
plans are designed to aid and sup-
port one another in the success of
the overall Annual Fund.

The names of the regions and
their respective agents are listed on
the inside cover. Each agent will re-
cruit an average of eight to ten
helpers, thus forming a host of
nearly a thousand workers to urge
those former students within their
region who have not yet participat-
ed in the current annual fund to
join this important effort. ‘The re-
cord goal, established by Robert
Kime and his Alumni Fund Coun-
cil, is a challenge to every alumnus.
If you are among those who have
not yet made a gift to Washington
and Lee this fund year, the chances
are that one of these agents or his
helper will be calling on you soon.
He may be a friend or a neighbor—
not necessarily a classmate or even
contemporary in age, but in every
case a dedicated alumnus who has
not only made his gift to the fund

18

but is also giving of his time and
effort in this undertaking which is
so important to you as an alumnus
and to your University.

The goals established by the
Fund Council are the highest in
history. In 1956 the fund reached,
for the first time, the $100,000 level.
Since then, with time out for the
University Development Program,
the annual fund has steadily in-
creased each year, reaching a to-
tal of $142,000 last year.

As the Regional Agents begin
their work, they can be encouraged
by the fact that the dollar volume
is ahead of this same date last year.
However, the number of contribu-
tors is lagging behind, and this is
the most challenging element in
the campaign. Only 26% of the
alumni on the active mailing list
and who receive this magazine have
participated in this year’s fund.
This means that one out of every
four is supporting Washington and
Lee and higher education for the
other three.

The Fund Council, in setting a
contributor goal of 100%, is admit-
tedly ambitious. Yet the members
are convinced that to set an arbi-
trary percentage figure would miss
the point. ‘To receive support from
each alumnus is indeed our goal,
for all Washington and Lee men
share the pride in progress at Wash-
ington and Lee.

As this magazine goes to print
there are 2869 contributors to this
year’s fund. Last year a total of
3,905 participated to establish a
record, and the Fund Council is
hopeful that a significant increase
can be made this year. Many col-
leges and universities—those of the
same size and character as Wash-
ington and Lee and those with
which alumni generally like to
make comparisons—are able to
achieve 50% to 75% participation
in their annual campaigns. And
they define an alumnus in the same
way as does Washington and Lee.
When the regional worker calls on
you he is serving as your agent, for
this is not a job for just a few—it
is a responsibility, even a_privi-
lege, of all Washington and Lee
men.

The central alumni office reports
that much progress has been made
on the publication of a new Alum-
ni Directory. This will be in the
hands of the publishers in May,
and it is hoped that distribution
of the finished copies will be pos-
sible before the close of the fund’s
fiscal year on June goth. To ex-
press appreciation for thoughtful
interest and support, the Council
has authorized that a copy of the
new directory be mailed free of
charge to every man who partici-
pates in the 1963-64 Alumni Fund.
The directory will be a treasured
possession as well as a useful one.
Every Washington and Lee man
should be proud to have one. It
can be a symbol of his membership
in a distinguished body of men
who are the Alumni of Washington
and Lee.

Whether you are in one of the
regional areas or not, if you have
not yet registered your interest in
Washington and Lee, don’t wait.
Make your contribution to the
Alumni Fund now. You will be
proud to participate in something
which is great and which, with
your help, will be forever enduring.

Once Again!

For the Ninth Time in Thirteen
Attempts, the Mock Convention at
Washington and Lee Has Proven
An Authentic Political Barometer.
It Was Goldwater on the Second
Ballot, as W&L’s Students Staged the

Best Mock Convention of All!

Senior law student Puitie D. SHARP, JR., of Richmond,

SUMMER 1964

HE MAN FROM Time Magazine slipped his folded
A notes into his coat pocket as he looked out across
the nearly deserted convention hall sometimes known
as Doremus Gymnasium.

There, two hours earlier, Washington and Lee’s
1,256 students—in convention assembled for the uni-
versity’s thirteenth quadrennial Mock Convention—
had nominated Senator Barry Goldwater as the Re-
publican standard-bearer, come July and November.

The man from Time turned to the Washington
and Lee publicity man and smiled. “Of course you
know you're wrong this time,” he said.

The Washington and Lee man—who had just sur-
vived his fourth Mock Convention—smiled back and
replied: “We'll see. I have a lot of confidence in the
way our boys went about this thing. I think they made
a conscientious effort to pick the right man.”

“Well,” the Time man said as he extended his
hand to bid goodbye, “if you are right this time, it
will really be a feather in your cap.”

The day was May 5, nearly a month before the
crucial California primary, and two and a half months
before the actual head-count of delegates to the Re-
publican Convention in San Francisco’s Cow Palace.
Goldwater was the front-runner in early May, it was
true, but few impartial political observers were will-
ing to predict publicly with any real confidence that
the Arizona senator’s lead in delegate strength would
hold up until mid-July.

But, Washington and Lee’s Mock Convention tra-

3

dition extends back to 1908, over a
half-century of often bold predic-
tions. When it came time for the
1964 student generation to go out
on its political limb, the nomina-
tion went to Goldwater as the man
most likely to succeed in San Fran-
cisco. Behind the student politick-
ing that gave Goldwater a second
ballot victory was a full year of
intensive research and study by
hundreds of convention officials—
the chairman, law senior Philip
D. Sharp of Richmond, his impres-
sively competent steering commit-
tee, the fifty-three state delegation
chairmen, and many others. Nev-
er in the twelve previous Mock
Conventions had so much time,
effort, and money been poured in-
to the attempt to pick accurately
the presidential nominee for the
party out of power.

At stake was the finest record of
accuracy and authenticity of any
of the country’s fifty-odd collegiate
mock conventions. ‘The record
stood at eight correct choices in

twelve tries, and there was an im-
pressive current string of correct
nominations to preserve—Eisenhow-
er in 1952, Stevenson in 1956, Ken-
nedy in ig6o.

Because of this outstanding re-
cord, the 1964 Mock Republican
Convention had attracted more at-
tention from the press and more
attention from the Republican na-
tional organization than in any
other election year. ‘The Washing-
ton and Lee process of picking the
right man was virtually on trial,
and throughout the months leading
up to the convention the Republi-
can prospectus was almost hopeless-
ly confused.

When the students gave Gold-
water a whopping 601 ballots on
the first roll-call, and then went on
to push him over on the second bal-
lot, the consensus among the news-
men and non-Goldwater GOP ob-
servers on hand was that the W&L
boys had missed by a mile.

If the man from Time doubted
the accuracy of the W&L choice, he

was impressed by the way the stu-
dents went about their 1964 Mock
Convention. In his magazine’s next
issue there was an article dealing
with the nationwide mock con-
vention phenomenon, and_ the
Washington and Lee event was fea-
tured in words and photographs.
He called the W&L affair “the
biggest and boomingest” of them
all. He described the organization
and planning of the convention in
detail, underscoring the authentic-
ity sought by the Washington and
Lee students. The article concluded
with a series of paragraph summar-
ies of what happened at some other
mock conventions. At only one—
Brooklyn College—was the choice
the same as Washington and Lee’s
and the next issue of Time carried
an indignant letter from a Brook-
lyn College student, declaring that
they did not nominate Goldwater
as reported.

There was a pattern to the
choices of the other schools. At

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

from 1861, students chose Scran-
ton on the fourth ballott, and the
majority of colleges mentioned by
Time concurred, although one
(Vanderbilt) picked Nixon, and
another (Ohio) chose Lodge. At
Staunton’s Mary Baldwin, the
girls went for Rockefeller in their
convention held in late February.

In addition to the Time article—
a prized companion piece to a simi-
lar story on the 1960 Mock Conven-
tion that appeared in Newsweek—
the 1964 event also drew coverage
from the New York Times, the
Washington Evening Star, both
major wire services, almost every
major daily in Virginia, and a half-
dozen of the smaller dailies. ‘The
Doremus facilities for handling the
press were taxed to the limit.

The 1964 convention was well-
promoted. Beginning in June of
1963, Chairman Sharp and_ his
steering committee worked closely
with the university’s publicity of-
fice to publish a pair of promotion-
al brochures that went to every
member of Congress and to Repub-
lican leaders in every state.

Sharp’s staff called personally on
GOP leaders and on editors to ex-
plain the workings of their con-
vention and to enlist their support.
Their leg work paid handsome re-
sults in terms of funds, materials,
and advice from the Republican
organization, at both national and
state levels, and in the advance
stories on the convention and the
actual coverage by the press.

None of Washington and Lee’s
previous Mock Conventions was as
elaborate in its planning or its
execution. Phil Sharp joined an
outstanding roster of student lead-
ers who have chaired previous
Mock Conventions, but in addi-
tion to Sharp’s personal high quali-
fications for the convention’s top
job, he had available perhaps the
finest array of steering committee-
men and state delegation chairmen
to ever organize a W&L Mock Con-
vention.

SUMMER 1964

 

The 1964 Mock Convention was easier to see and hear. A ballot tally board above the

rostrum recorded the progress of the roll call of states, while delegation chairmen on

the floor announced their votes by hand microphones over the convention hall’s public
address system.

Charles B. Rowe, a senior law
student from Courtland, Va., was
assistant

convention chairman,
while Donald H. Partington, a
enior law student from Spring-
field, Va., was chairman of state
delegations. Edward M. Norton,
Jr., a Butler, Pa., senior, served as
convention secretary, and Wyatt
B. Durrette, Jr., a senior law stu-
dent from Franklin, Va., acted as
the convention’s Republican Na-
tional Chairman. Stephen P. Smith,
Ill, a junior from Jacksonville,
Fla., was publicity chairman, and
law senior Peter ‘T. Straub of St.
Louis was head of pre-convention
activities. A. John Huss, of Evans-
ton, Ill., and Donald W. Huffman

 

of Lexington, both intermediate
lawyers, headed up a finance com-
mittee that somehow marshalled
enough resources to meet the $12,-
000 in expenses incurred by the
convention.

Although not a member of the
steering committee, William  B.
“Buck” Ogilvie, a Shreveport, La.,
senior, was placed in charge of con-
vention hall arrangements, and the
decorations there were unprece-
dented in their profusion and col-
or. From Fort Lee, Va., Ogilvie
borrowed a set of fifty state flags
which ringed the convention floor
from the balcony. Giant banners
and huge photographic likenesses
proclaimed the availability of ev-

Chairman SHARP hangs bunting on the
Convention Hall entrance while—————

ery major candidate and some of
the minor ones. ‘Thousands of smal-
ler signs and thousands of balloons
added to the color, as did huge
quantities of red, white and blue
bunting.

Ogilvie also designed and con-
structed a giant tally board over
the platform by which everyone in
the hall could follow the mount-
ing totals of the various candidates
during the roll call of states. He
arranged for a special public ad-
dress system that permitted every
state chairman to cast his vote by
microphone from his delegation’s
section on the convention floor.
This same PA system also permit-
ted delegates to hear Senator Gold-
water personally accept the Wash-
ington and Lee nomination by tele-
phone, minutes after the conclusion
of the second ballot. Both the tal-

6

 

ly board and the expanded sound
facilities were Mock Convention
“firsts.”

But of all the workers who
helped make the 1964 Mock Con-
vention a success, none labored
more effectively than did senior
John M. Madison, Jr., also of
Shreveport. Madison served as
chairman of the traditional ‘‘kick-
off” parade that preceded the open-
ing keynote session of the conven-
tion. Like the convention itself, the
1964 parade was called the “best
ever” by old Lexington hands like
Art Silver, and many others. But
no other parade chairman ever
faced the problems and challenges
that John Madison did.

If the 1964 convention was on
trial to pick the right candidate,
its leadership also was on trial to
conduct an orderly convention, in-
cluding the parade and the con-
vention hall activities. The 1960
convention had drawn severe criti-
cism from Lexington townspeople
and others for student misbehavior
and rowdiness in the parade and
during the keynote and nominating
sessions. As soon as Chairman
Sharp had organized his steering
committee, the university—through
a special three-man advisory com-
mittee—requested the student plan-
ners to take steps to assure that
the 1964 event would in no way
embarrass the university or offend
spectators.

The steering committee request-
ed time for a special student as-
sembly in April where Sharp and
Madison emphasized the impor-
tance of student responsibility in
all matters relating to the conven-
tion. Madison’s address in particu-
lar struck just the right note of
informality and good humor that
let the meat of his message fall on
receptive ears.

Then Madison turned to the ac-

tual parade planning. Bands were

at a premium because of the co-
incidence of the Mock Convention
with the Apple Blossom Festival in

Winchester and the Azalea Festival
in Norfolk. He came up with five,
including the Staunton Military
Academy band which was accorded
the honor of leading the parade.
‘The VMI band, formerly the tradi-
tional parade leader, declined the
university's official invitation to
participate.

Madison negotiated with the
Lexington Chamber of Commerce
and the Town Council and had the
month of May proclaimed “History
and Education Month” in consider-
ation of the Mock Convention and
the Marshall Research Library
dedication at VMI. He also nego-
tiated with a firm that provided
huge quantities of bunting for dec-
orating streets, store fronts, fra-
ternity houses, and the convention
hall itself.

And there was the GOP symbol,
a live elephant, to be found. ‘The
last Republican convention, in
1952, had boasted a live baby ele-
phant for its parade, and Madison
was determined to have one for his.
He finally located an elephant own-
er who would rent his animal, but
on one condition—Madison would

have to take two elephants (big
ones, not babies) for as the man ex-
plained, “One elephant gets lone-
some.” No one was really sure the
elephants would arrive from their
home in Ohio until they pulled in-
to town aboard their own van on
the Sunday afternoon before Mon-
day’s parade. (See the related ar-
ticle on Page 15 about how an
alumnus figured prominently in
getting Madison his elephants.)

SHARP is all smiles upon the
arrival of two “GOP” ele-
phants on the day before the
convention opened on May 4.
The steering committee, with
alumni help, rented the ele-
phants from a circus in Ohio
to lead the big kickoff parade.

While the Apple Blossom festi-
val caused band problems, it
helped solve many state delega-
tions’ float problems. Some of the
more affluent state delegations con-
tracted with Winchester owners to
rent elaborate floats that had ap-
peared in the preceding Saturday’s
festival parade. ‘The floats were to
come down the Valley on Sunday,
but there was a legal technicality
about moving such vehicles on
Sunday without a permit. There
were a few anxious hours for Madi-
son and his associates before the
people of Winchester agreed to
leave at the crack of dawn on Mon-
day in order to arrive at the parade
assembly area by noon. All made
it, although the New York float
arrived only minutes before the
parade’s start.

The parade staging area was at
the Lexington Recreation Field at
the south end of town. Along the
line of march, Madison stationed

SUMMER 1964

a corps of assistant parade marshals,
some armed with walkie-talkie ra-
dios at strategic intervals to help
facilitate the parade’s smooth move-
ment.

Everything went along with pre-
cision. At 2 p.m. the parade was
ready to roll, except for one prob-
lem. President Cole and keynote
speaker Dr. Walter Judd weren't
there to take their places near the
head of the procession. Dr. Judd

and other dignitaries had been
President Cole’s guests at lunch-
eon, and although virtually every
other detail was attended to, no
one had devised a way to get them
from the President’s house to the
assembly area.

Finally, the frantic calls over the
parade radio network were over-
heard by a Lexington auto dealer
on his Citizens’ Band transceiver,
and he rushed to the Cole home,
picked up the president and Dr.
Judd and sped them, via. Volks-
wagon, to the Recreation Field.

Photographers there promptly
maneuvered Dr. Judd and Virginia
Sixth District Representative Rich-
ard Poff onto the elephants for
news photos. Judd and Poff waved
and smiled, but it was obvious they
wished their party symbol wasn't
so alive or so dirty. An attempt to
get the elephants washed that
morning apparently had failed.

A half hour late, the parade final-

ly started its mile-long march to
the convention hall. ‘There were
sixty-three separate units, includ-
ing floats from virtually every state
delegation and a handful of special
entries. Pretty girls from Hollins,
Sweet Briar, Randolph-Macon,
Mary Baldwin and other cultural
centers were on hand in lovely pro-
fusion, in many respects outshin-
ing the imported beauty queens
which have of late become a Mock

 

tradition in them-

Convention
selves.

Back in 1956 the New Jersey
delegation brought the reigning
Miss America, Sharon Kay Ritch-
ie, to the convention, and duplicat-
ed this feat in 1960 with Lynda
Lee Mead. The 1964 Miss America,
Donna Axum, was unavailable, but
the Ohio delegation invited the
1963 winner, Jackie Mayer, to be
its guest and she accepted. ‘The cur-
rent Miss Virginia, Dorcas Camp-
bell, had only to come from near-
by Fairfield, her home, and there
were four other state beauty
queens imported for the festivi-
ties. ‘These included Miss New
York (Paula Heins), Miss Texas
(Jeanie Amacker), Miss Maine
(Elaine Ouilette), and Miss South
Carolina (Carolyn Lee Gaines).

Later at the convention hall Miss
Virginia sang the National An-
them, Miss Mayer spoke briefly

Floats in the 1964 parade were more elaborate than ever before. Many state delegations
built their own, while others rented commercially-constructed floats from Winchester’s
Apple Blossom Festival. There were plenty of pretty girls to ride on both kinds.

from the podium, and the others
were introduced on the floor, all to
great acclaim.

Dr. and Mrs. Judd joined Presi-
dent and Mrs. Cole and other dis-
tinguished guests in the reviewing
stand on the president’s lawn to
watch the hour-long show. Awards
went to the best band (Staunton
Military), the best home-made float
(Texas’ LBJ barbeque), and the
best rented float (Puerto Rico).

The Puerto Rican delegation was
one of the most colorful of the con-
vention. For several days prior to
the convention its members had
attended class in white Panama
suits and Panama hats, smoking
big cigars, and looking as Latin as
possible. When their float passed
the reviewing stand, they dismount-
ed and presented Dr. Judd (a tee-
totaler) with a gift of Puerto Rican
rum.

- Judd was the keynote speaker
to the real Republican Convention
in 1960, so his choice for the Mock
Convention role was a logical one.

10

When the former Minnesota Con-
gressman finally took the podium
for the keynote address he de-
livered a real rouser of a partisan
call to arms. He accused the John-
son administration of negotiating
with the Communists from ‘a po-
sition of weakness” and he called
for a Republican victory in Novem-
ber to avert a “national disaster.”

‘The keynoter went on for an
hour and ten minutes, and if the
delegates’ response over the long
haul was perhaps a shade less than
might have been expected, it was
because they had been deadened
even before Judd began. Several
other Republican dignitaries had
been introduced to the convention,
and each had seized the opportun-
ity to pitch political hay. The
lengthy and at times inappropriate
remarks at the opening session pro-
vided the only slowdown in the
two-day convention agenda.

That night, Congressman Abner
W. Sibal of New Jersey made mer-
cifully brief remarks before the
delegates got down to the fun-
filled task of nominating the can-

didates and staging the elaborate
demonstrations. In all, fourteen
names were placed in nomination,
including that of Fred Walker, the
Doremus Gym janitor who was en-
dorsed by the Puerto Rican dele-
gation.

Among the others were Gold-
water, Gov. Nelson Rockefeller,
Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge,
Gov. George Romney, Sen. Margar-
et Chase Smith, Sen. Gordon Allot
of Colorado, Sen. Hiram Fong of
Hawaii, Winthrop Rockefeller,
Dr. Judd, Gov. William Scranton,
Richard Nixon, Gov. James
Rhodes of Ohio, and Rep. John W.
Byrnes of Wisconsin. All were ac-
corded demonstrations of varying
length and intensity, with Gold-
water and Rockefeller supporters
staging the most prolonged and
raucous.

Two huge nets filled with bal-
loons were supposed to spill their
contents from high above the con-
vention floor when Goldwater was
nominated, but the release ropes
fouled and one of the nets fell in-

tact with balloons still inside. ‘The

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

Rockefeller demonstration featured
a giant paper-mache “rock” that
delegates paraded through the
convention hall.

The nominating ran over into
Tuesday morning before the roll
call of states began for the actual
balloting. With the clerk’s tradi-
tionally sonorous ‘Al-a-bamm-aah”
the voting began, and except for
the cheers from the various nom-
inees’ camps when support came
their way, a degree of seriousness
now settled over the convention.

A first ballot victory for Gold-
water was not expected, although
his campaign chairman, senior Wil-
liam Burke of Washington, D. C.,
boasted of a certain second ballot
triumph.

paigning by Goldwater, Rockefel-
ler would be the victor there by a
narrow margin.

Sylvester's announcement drew
much attention among the anti-
Goldwater forces and some criti-
cism from the pro-Goldwater dele-
gates. Throughout Monday visiting
newsmen played heavily on the
hopeful premise that California’s
refusal to back Goldwater would
stave off a first or second ballot vic-
tory, long enough to sap the sena-
tor’s delegate strength.

But Goldwater quickly built a
substantial lead, and when the first
roll call was completed, he had
amassed 601 votes, far in front of
Rockefeller’s 232, Lodge's 113, or
Scranton’s 102. The favorite sons

tion’s reputation for accuracy and
authenticity was at stake, sought an
adjournment until afternoon in or-
der to call a special meeting of
state chairmen to reemphasize their
responsibility not to vote personal
preferences.

Goldwater backers pushed for an
immediate second ballot, but in a
roll call vote on adjournment
Sharp got convention approval for
the breathing spell. As soon as dele-
gates had vacated the gym, Sharp
spoke to his chairmen, urging them
to check with their contacts in the
various states, inform them of the
first ballot results, and seek their
advice on how to vote on the next
roll call.

A special telephone room had

 

KEYNOTER JuDD attacked Democrats and Communists in a rousing address that lasted for an hour and ten minutes.

The biggest stumbling block to
a first ballot win for the Arizona
senator was the decision of the
California delegation to give its
eighty-six votes to Governor Rocke-
feller. Chairman Jim Sylvester an-
nounced prior to the convention
that his analysis of the situation in
California and neighboring Ore-
gon indicated that Rockefeller
would run strongly in both states.
The Las Vegas senior reasoned that
Rockefeller strength in Oregon
would be reflected in the California
campaign, and that in the expected
absence of spirited personal cam-

SUMMER 1964

made up the balance of the 1,308
delegates, and many of these were
expected to switch to Goldwater
on the second go-round.

Rumors circulated among the
delegates, observers, and the press
that some of Goldwater’s first-bal-
lot strength and some of his antici-
pated second-ballot support were
being derived not from educated,
well-advised political strategy dic-
tated by GOP leaders in the re-
spective states but by the delegates’
personal preferences for Goldwat-
er conservatism. Chairman Sharp,
acutely aware that the conven-

been installed in the gym, and six
so-called “hot lines” were available
for state chairmen use. The Lexing-
ton ‘Telephone Company estimated
that long distance traffic during
the course of the convention av-
eraged some 50 to 60 calls per hour
above normal. When the second
ballot began shortly after 2 p.m.,
the roll call was interrupted re-
peatedly for announcement of long
distance calls awaiting one state
chairman or another. The delega-
tion leaders apparently had made
the big effort that Sharp had re-
quested,

11

Again Goldwater vaulted into an
early and rapidly growing lead. He
picked up a handful of votes from
Arkansas, a few more from Colo-
rado, three more in Illinois. Cali-
fornia stuck with Rockefeller, but
by two’s and three’s support gath-
ered for Governor Scranton until
it became apparent that any “stop
Goldwater” movement would rally
behind the Pennsylvanian.

Maryland provided the first sig-
nificant change when Goldwater
lost six delegates and Scranton
picked up seven. Then Montana,
which had given the Arizonan four-
teen first ballot votes, switched all
fourteen to Scranton. For a mo-
ment Goldwater supporters looked
anxiously at the tally board as the
chant of “Stop Barry” echoed
through the hall.

But Ohio, after backing Gov-
ernor Brown on the first ballot,
this time gave Goldwater twenty-
five of its fifty-eight votes, and
Scranton salvaged only eight. Lit-
tle by little Goldwater edged clos-
er to the necessary 655 total, and
his count stood at 636 when Wis-
consin was called. The Bagder
State had given all of its 30 votes
to favorite son Congressman Byrnes
on the first roll call, but now it had
the power to put Goldwater over.
Chairman Fred Schaeffer of Swarth-
more, Pa., declared the state’s en-
tire block solidly behind Goldwat-
er and the convention hall erupted
into bedlam. Newsmen shook their
heads, some sadly.

Oregon and Rhode Island, which
had passed, now came in with
Goldwater support, and other states
sought recognition to change their
votes. Not all changed in favor of
the senator. New York, after split-
ting into many fragments on the
second ballot, returned ninety-two
strong for Rockefeller in defiance
of the Goldwater victory. Califor-
nia finally swung to Goldwater,
making the final total, before the
routine formality of a unanimous
motion, 718 for Goldwater, 218 for

12

Rockefeller, 162 for Scranton, 106
for Nixon, and 104 for Lodge.

During the final minutes of the
roll call, Chairman Sharp was on
the telephone at the podium, plac-
ing a call to Senator Goldwater’s
office in Washington. At the other
end, Dean Burch—destined to be-
come the national Republican
chairman—arranged to have the
senator stand by. When the nom-
ination was finally acclaimed,
Sharp announced that Goldwater
would speak to the convention over
the public address system.

Said Senator Goldwater: “I have
great regard for Washington and
Lee and its convention, and I ac-
cept with great humility the hon-
or you've bestowed upon me.” He

 

Aaall-a-bammm-ahhhh!”’

told the convention he was fight-
ing to preserve “constitutional de-
mocracy and the free enterprise
system,’ and he concluded with his
hope that the Washington and Lee
victory would be “‘a good omen for
July and November.”

The nomination of a running
mate, where absolutely no record
of accuracy is preserved at Wash-
ington and Lee, was confused but
quick. here was a rumor that
Goldwater had somehow expressed
favor of Nixon as a vice-presiden-
tial candidate, and many states be-
grudgingly gave the former vice-
president their support. But the
rumor was rapidly discredited, and

popularity contest, contrary to
Mock Convention tradition? Did
the Goldwater professionals exert
a distorting influence upon the bal-
loting? Or was Goldwater, at this
stage early in May, a much strong-
er political force that many were
willing to admit?

The Time magazine man lunch-
ed that Tuesday with Sharp, Wyatt
Durette, and Don Partington, and
came away convinced that, so far
as the convention leadership was
concerned, a conscientious and
faithful effort had been made to
reflect genuine Republican senti-
ment. An unscientific sampling of
student opinion did reflect substan-
tial personal Goldwater backing,
but this seemed coincidence rather
than a determining factor.

The Goldwater _ professionals
were active indeed, but whether
alleged disillusionment apparently
influence their coverage of the
Goldwater triumph. The New York
Times, which had devoted a full
column well up in the first section
to the first day’s activities, rele-
gated the news of the final out-
come, as one pro-Goldwater  col-
umnist put it, “back among the
truss ads.” The Associated Press
representative reported the Gold-
water win with the AP’s character-
istic Objectivity, but he made no
bones about his personal disgust
with the convention’s choice.

What was the truth of the mat-
ter? Had the students voted in a
a contest developed between Nix-
on and Scranton. Scranton was the
final victor by a twenty vote mar-
gin, 664 to 644. |

Even after Goldwater had won,
the debate continued as to whether
the students had reflected their per-
sonal choice or the advice of real
GOP insiders. Newsmen, almost to
a man, felt that the very active
presence of a corps of well-organiz-
ed Goldwater professionals had
helped swing a substantial num-
ber of ballots.

Some of the news media let the

they were successful in swinging
any states away from their intended
courses could not be proven. It zs
possible that their organization and
accumulation of political intelli-
gence may have helped underscore
the accuracy of the information
that had been gleaned from other
sources.

One of the biggest sources of
advice came from the rank and file
GOP county and city chairmen
across the nation. In mid-April, a
questionnaire had gone out from
Mock Convention headquarters to
every GOP local chairman in the
nation, some 3,400 of them. Only
two questions were asked: Which
candidates will your state delega-
tion support on the first ballot? If
after the first ballot, the totals are
Goldwater—425; Nixon—200; Scran-
ton—200; Rockefeller—150; and
Lodge—125, to whom, if to anyone,
would your delegates switch? Lo-
cal chairmen were asked to indicate
splits where appropriate.

The return from the question-
naire was nearly fifty per cent,
much greater than had been expect-
ed. The results reflected clearly, in
the opinion of Sharp and his asso-
clates, that Goldwater did indeed

have sufhcient strength to win in
July.

Now, with the events of mid-
July in San Francisco lending some
clarity of interpretation to the
Washington and Lee scene of early
May, it does seem that the Wash-
ington and Lee students did, in
fact, a truly remarkable job of
political forecasting. Much has
been written since July about the
strength and the vitality of the
Goldwater organization that built
up after the bleak days which fol-
lowed the New Hampshire prim-
ary. A comparison of first ballot
votes at Lexington and San Fran-
cisco suggests that, as far as was hu-
manly possible in April and May,
the Washington and Lee students
had indeed detected this burgeon-
ing Goldwater strength, had noted
the efficiency of its organization,
had interpreted the strategy of
state convention control, and had,
finally, translated this intelligence
into a Goldwater victory at the
Mock Convention.

So now the record stands at nine
correct choices in thirteen conven-

tions, with four bull’s-eyes in a row.
None was an easy selection. ‘Taft
was the front-runner in 1952 when

Washington and Lee and Chair-
man Townsend Oast chose Eisen-
hower and were right. Stevenson,
Symington, and Kefauver were all
possibilities when Carl Swanson’s
tragedy-marked 1956 convention
chose Stevenson and was right.
Kennedy had yet to win the West
Virginia primary or to make his
famous Houston address to Protest-
ant ministers when Charles McCor-
mick’s 1960 convention made him
the nominee and was right. A more
contused situation could not be im-
agined in 1964 when Phil Sharp’s
convention spotted the Goldwater
movement for its true strength.

‘The 1964 convention left an un-
precedented collection of records
and other data to guide the organ1-
zation of future Mock Conventions
at Washington and Lee. Sitting
among the rank and file delegates
in May, 1964, was a young man to
whom responsibility will fall in
1968 of carrying on one of Wash-
ington and Lee’s proudest student
traditions. Whoever he may be, he
already has his work cut out for
him, but his task will be aided by
the exemplary work of the 1964
Mock Convention.

It was the best.

Know Any New
Elephant Fokes, George?

(Alumnus Grorce TZANGAS, ’56L, helped lo-

cate the elephants which led the Mock Con-

vention parade. Here is an account of the

elephants’ departure for Lexington by re-

porter Ep Downe of the Canton, Ohio,
Repository.)

= PEOPLE WONDERED when Canton Atty. George Tzan-
gas began to talk about elephants.

“I'll get your elephants for you,” he assured some-
one over the phone. His secretary and law partner
began to wonder if Mr. T'zangas weren’t ready for the
booby hatch.

Mr. ‘T'zangas had found himself charged with the
responsibility of transporting two elephants, or five
and one-half tons of pachyderms, to Lexington, Va.,
home of Washington and Lee University.

He explained that every four years since 1908 the
university has held a mock political convention, and
every time they have had a Republican convention
they have also had elephants.

Mock Convention chairman Philip Sharp handed
Mr. Tzangas the task of getting two elephants to
Lexington in time for the convention parade.

Mr. ‘Tzangas, a Washington and Lee alumnus, ar-
ranged to have the elephants transported from Diano’s
Ranch southeast of Canton to the university—about
425 miles.

Shortly before departure time Saturday the attor-
ney, this reporter and photographer Jim Brown. ar-
rived at Diano’s Ranch.

We were introduced to handler Henry (Blackie)
McGrothers who seemed a little nervous about trans-
porting the animals in a huge van. In fact he in-
formed us they had trouble starting the truck that
morning.

“Do you think you'll make it all right?” Mr. Tzan-
gas asked.

“IT think I'll be okay,” Blackie said. And then he
added, “As long as the truck doesn’t break down.”

We were led to the barn where two elephants stood
side by side.

“Will they hurt us?” we asked.

“Not as long as I’m with you,” Blackie told us. We
felt better.

Blackie led the elephants out the door. He loaded
one elephant named Betsy into the van, while the
other elephant carefully climbed over a barbed wire
fence and began hot-footing it across the pasture.

Blackie realized he was losing an elephant. He be-

gan running across the pasture shouting things people
shout at elephants when they are trying to catch them.

“Well, there goes your elephant,” we told Mr.
Tzangas.

“Hed be: back? Mr: ‘T’zangas said as the elephant
and Blackie disappeared over a hill.

We waited for five...then ten minutes. Mr.
Tzangas seemed less confident.

“What,” we asked, “if he runs to Canton and be-
gins terrorizing the city?” We had heard of elephants
getting loose in a native village and trampling the in-
habitants.

In the meantime the other elephant began bang-
ing against the side of the van and trumpeting. We
theorized she missed the other elephant, or wanted a
little exercise herself.

“I believe she is going to get out,” Mr. Tzangas
said.

We agreed, and decided to move some distance
away.

Upon the scene came John Bein, who assured us
the elephants often get away. They run until they
get tired of exercising, he said, and then they can
be led back.

Apparently this elephant named Katie had enough
exercise because shortly thereafter she and Blackie
came over the hill together looking like old friends.

Katie was loaded into the truck.

Feeling somewhat like African adventurers, we
walked up to the house to call Mr. Sharp in Lexington
and tell him his elephants were on the way.

The Largest Graduating
Class in the University’s
History Receives Degrees

From President Fred Cole

HE LARGEST JUNE GRADUATING CLASS in the his-
Le of the University received bachelor de-
grees in commencement exercises conducted in
perfect weather on the front campus lawn on
June 5.

President Cole conferred degrees upon 253
seniors, including thirty-six in the School of Law,
eighty-two in the School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration, and 135 in the College.

President Cole delivered the graduating ad-
dress, calling on seniors to expand their concept
of the American free enterprise system to include
the academic world, recognizing, in Jefferson’s
words, “‘the illimitable freedom of the human
mind.”

“Consider these words,” President Cole said.
“The iulimitable freedom of the human mind—
the freedom and courage to follow truth down
new and adventurous paths—protection against
error by reason rather than by repression; here
we have a firm faith, I believe, for all liberty and
hope for the world.”

Washington and Lee conferred honorary de-
grees upon four distinguished persons, three
of them graduates of the University.

Dr. Stuart A. MacCorkle, ’24, director of the
Institute of Public Affairs of the University of
‘Texas, received the Doctor of Laws degree, as
did Dr. Andrew Tod Roy, ’25, vice-president of
Chung Chi College in Hong Kong, and Dr.
Louis B. Wright, director of the Folger Shakes-
peare Library in Washington, D.C. Dr. Samuel
L. Raines, ’21, Memphis physician and president >
of the American Urological Association, received
the Doctor of Science degree.

Lexington’s Biggest Day of All
Brings Thousands to VMI

Presidents Johnson and Eisenhower Spoke
At the Dedication of the Marshall Library;

Alumnus Charlie McDowell, Jr., Wrote a Hometown

Account for His Richmond ‘Times-Dispatch Column

By CHARLES MCDowELL, JR.

LEXINGTON, May 23—For years we had been
meaning to take the children to a parade at Virginia
Military Institute. It was just one of those things that
an old Lexingtonian had not got around to on the
visits to the grandparents.

Saturday it did occur to us to take the children over
to the parade ground to show them what a good show
the Institute can put on to liven things up in a small
town. It was a very nice parade.

The corps of cadets looked as splendid and precise
as it always had in our youthful days as a fairly steady
parade-goer, and the band playing the “Spirit of VMI”
at the end of the review still managed to stir the frosty
heart of a Washington and Lee type.

‘The children enjoyed the marching and also the
subsequent arrival of some famous people for speech-
making on the steps of the new George C. Marshall
Research Library.

i8

 

President Johnson came in one of four helicopters
that landed on the parade ground where we used to
try to learn to hit a two-iron. Former President Eisen-
hower came, too, and Governor Harrison, and Secre-
tary of State Rusk and various members of the cabinet,
and Senators Byrd and Robertson, and General Omar
Bradley, and a variety of congressmen and generals
and Secret Service men in dark glasses.

The children decided that VMI was a very lively
and interesting place, indeed, and wondered why we
had been keeping it from them.

* * * * *

WE TOWNSPEOPLE have held prolonged discus-
sions on the subject of what this was the greatest Lex-
ington event since.

Some contended that there never was anything re-
motely in the same league with this gathering, and

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

others hark back to the dedication of a statue of
Stonewall Jackson in the cemetery.

A few people tried to compare the occasion to foot-
ball games of the dim past in which one or the other of
the local colleges defeated the University of Virginia,
but that sort of historical perspective probably should
not be taken seriously.

One historian said flatly that the dedication of the
Marshall Library, with the attendant assemblage of
dignitaries, was the most awesome event in Lexington
since Hunter’s Raid.

General David Hunter’s Union troops shelled VMI
and set fire to it in 1864 or thereabouts. In fact, there is
still a cannon ball from that occasion embedded in the
outer wall of the barracks.

(At the risk of straying too far from current events,
we might say that there is a school of thought which
holds that the late Col. William Couper put the can-
non ball in the wall as a conversation piece.)

* * * * *

RARELY HAVE SO MANY people in Lexington
had so many house guests. “I am sleeping on the
floor,” one man said, “in my own house.”

For Lexington this was a reunion of three or four
generations of children, in-laws, cousins, alumni of
VMI and W&L, friends and strangers.

JOHNSON, speaking in the senator’s
hometown, failed to mention his
presence among the dignitaries.

SUMMER 1964

Everyone seemed to have a really good time. The
President apparently enjoyed the interlude, his heli-
copter sparing him the traffic jam, and the people en-
joyed having the President. He took several chances to
plunge into the crowd and shake hands. His manner
was friendly and flattering with no overtones of a
visit to poverty-stricken hill people.

* * * * *

SPECULATION on the size of the crowd varied
widely. A state police captain said 10,000, but that
was based on the number of cars in special parking
lots, allowing two and a half people, or some such
figure, to the car.

Reluctant as we are to argue with the state police,
the crowd was much larger than 10,000. The state
police counters missed all the houseguests’ cars crowd-
ed into driveways and parked in ingenious places all
over town. We came five or six to the car, too.

We would say that there were 10,000 townspeople
and houseguests plus the visitors who parked in the
special lots. About 20,000 would seem fair to us, allow-
ing for our hometown pride, and a VMI officer’s esti-
mate of 15,000 strikes us as eminently conservative.

Anyway, there were twice as many people trying to
get Cokes in McCrum’s Drug Store as we ever saw, and
that is an index that means something.

SUMMER 1964

We bR. COLE called me to ask if it might be pos-

sible for me to be present on this occasion I was
tremendously honored and pleased, because it gave me
an opportunity, first of all, to come home again—some-
thing that I’ve found you can do even though changes
take place. ‘There still is so much that is just about the
same as it was when you knew it. It gave me an oppor-
tunity, also, to have the fellowship and renew the
friendship that I enjoyed with so very many of you.

In thinking about something to say, I felt that I
might take the opportunity to do a little correcting
of some errors that I made about 25 years ago here at
the University. I hold in my hand a copy of the
Southern Collegian for December, 1937. Now Cy
Young’s about to burst because he remembers that
this issue resulted in the Southern Collegian being
banned on the campus in 1937. In going back through
this particular copy, I had some trouble finding out
exactly why it was banned. Maybe I come from a much
more liberal part of the country at the present time,
but if I were fortunate enough to get a copy of the
“humor magazine” in my institution which was as
clean as this one I never would complain! At any rate,
it was banned.

I have an article in here. I had some pipelines into
the faculty meetings in those days and I’m informed
when the faculty was discussing the banning of this
particular issue that one member of the faculty who

21

was opposed to the ban got up and said, “Now the
great campus liberal Harry Philpott has an article in
here. You're not going to throw him out, are you?”
The article has a question. “Are we getting an educa-
tion?” It was written when I was a senior here at
Washington and Lee. Unfortunately, in answering the
question, I left some doubt. Or maybe fortunately. I’m
not sure.

Wise Counsel from Dr. Gaines

In those days I had a great crusading desire. I re-
member a year or so later, after I had served here at
Washington and Lee and was about to take a leave of
absence for graduate work, I read the Carnegie report
on graduate education which came out in the spring
of 1940. The report took to task the American gradu-
ate school because of its specialization in graduate
work. It said that we are producing researchers and
not teachers in our graduate programs. I was so impres-
ed by that that I began to think about my own gradu-
ate program. I went in one day to see Dr. Gaines and
said, “I’ve come up with a new program. I want to go
to Yale one year, to Columbia one year and to Chicago
one year. I want to forget all about taking a Ph.D. be-
cause I don’t think that I can get the same kind of
educational experience that I could get if I simply
went to these institutions and took the courses that I
wanted to take.” In his kind fashion he said, ‘“That
sounds wonderful. It’s a marvelous program. But
Harry, if you’re going to stay in college work I’d better
tell you this. A Ph.D. is like a pair of pants. If you’ve
got it you fit in. But if you haven’t got it, you’re just
as noticeable as you can be around the institution.”
I must confess that it was sound and sage advice. At

 

99
om

this later stage, I am delighted that I took it. For-
tunately, I was able to combine some of my crusading
and innovating desires along with the graduate pro-
gram I had.

This particular article made three complaints
about our educational experience at Washington and
Lee. ‘Uhe first of these was that so many of our extra
curricular activities were totally useless. In part, this
was true. A great many of our extra curricular activi-
ties, (here are some of my fraternity brothers sitting
here. If we got together in private, we could document
this.) from the perspective of 25 years later, were quite
useless. And yet, looking back, so many things that ap-
peared to be useless at that time were activities which
contributed tremendously to growth and_ develop-
ment, to the ability later on to handle a variety of ex-
periences. After all, it’s very difficult from within a par-
ticular situation or within a particular activity to give
an objective and true evaluation of the worth of that
situation or activity. In retrospect, as we gather to-
gether as alumni and think back over our experiences
at Washington and Lee, I’m sure that for many of us
the extra curricular activities in which we participated
made almost as much contribution as the course work
that we experienced.

I complained in this article that there was a sepa-
ration between the classroom and the world, that what
we were learning was not related to the reality of life
itself, and that we were too remote from the main-
stream of life. In retrospect, I forgot about Words-
worth’s lines:

“The world is too much with us; late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
Little we see in Nature that is ours.”

From another perspective I would yearn for a time
when the world was not quite so much with us, when
it was possible to be more remote from the mainstream
of life in order that one might see and one might ana-
lyze a little bit better that which was taking place. We
can rejoice that at least for a small period of time in
lite we had an opportunity to pull back but not com-
pletely withdraw, to see things through a little bit
more detached perspective.

A “Thought Map” of the Universe

I complained also about the inadequacy of the
curriculum in this article. The main thing that I
hollered about was the lack of survey courses. Even
in those days I think I wanted someone to produce
my metaphysic for me, someone who would analyze
all of the material and bring it together so that I
might have a thought map of the universe laid out
for me without any kind of cogitation and effort on
my part. When I look back and see the kind of cur-
riculum that we had at Washington and Lee, when I
see the unity that ran through that curriculum in
comparison with other educational institutions, I
didn’t have a great deal to complain about.

I served on an evaluation team recently at a large
southern university and looked through the cata-
logue. (i was looking through it very carefully. I don’t
dare do this in my own institution because of what I
might see, but I am willing to do it for other people.
You can’t make changes in your own situation, but
you feel perfectly free as an expert in another town
to make recommendations.) In this particular institu-
tion I noticed two courses at the graduate level. One
was entitled “The Teaching of Political Science in
Colleges” and the other was entitled “College Teach-
ing of Political Science.’ Each one carried three hours
credit. I had to inquire about this and was told by
the chairman of the department that one was directed
toward the teaching of political science in junior col-
leges and one was directed toward the teaching of
political science in four-year institutions. This was
sufficient rationale for splitting up the course and to
making it two separate courses. Well, that’s an ex-
treme case of fragmentation.

We did, I think, have available to us a great deal
more unity and we had available more survey courses
than existed in those days in most institutions.

The American higher education picture today is
most confusing. The late Chancellor Kirkland of Van-
derbilt used to tell about a Negro janitor in the early
days of Vanderbilt who also doubled as the campus
guide. He would take groups of visitors around the
Vanderbilt campus for viewing purposes and when
he brought them back to the main building at the end

SUMMER 1964

of his tour he always dismissed them with the saying
that “Education am de palladium of our liberties and
de pandemonium of our civilization.”

If it were true of Vanderbilt and other institutions
fifty to sixty years ago, how much more true it is of
higher education in general today! I don’t know how a
contemporary student would answer the question “Are
we getting an education?”

We are faced, for example, with the tremendous
pressure of numbers today. When I entered Washing-
ton and Lee thirty years ago, one of the things said to
us in the orientation program was that already we
were one of an elite group. Only ten per cent of all
the high school graduates were going to be able to go
to college in 1934. In 1964, fifty-five per cent of the
college-age population in the United States is enrolled
in an institution of higher learning. The numbers
have not only increased in recent years but more are
yet to come. In my state, for example, we had twenty
per cent more seniors graduating from high school this
year than we had one year ago. I remind you that
the high school seniors of this year were born in 1946—
most of them. The sheer weight of numbers is pre-
senting tremendously complex problems for American
higher education. We cannot produce the teachers
fast enough to take care of the numbers.

Washington and Lee, in one sense of the word, es-
capes this pressure because of the wisdom of those
who have guided its destiny and chosen to limit its en-
rollment. I hope, personally, that they have limited
its enrollment, not because of the philosophical be-
lief that you can do the best educational job with
only a certain number of students, but because they
have been convinced that the total resources of this
institution are sufficient only to take care of a certain
number. Even so, and I know this from contacts with
alumni, I am certain that those in charge of the in-
stitution at this time are frequently upbraided by
alumni and by friends of the institution who unfortu-
nately may not have succeeded in getting their sons

Into this institution, or by the friend of a friend of

a friend who’s “most important to me in my business,
or in my political life.”

The Importance of Selectivity

Every institution today must be selective. There is
available for any student who wishes a higher educa-
tion a place in American higher education today. It is
not always available in the first institution of his
choice, or at the particular place where he would like
to be, but no American young person is going to be
excluded from an educational experience today if he
truly has the desire and if he has the requisite prepa-
ration which will enable him to take advantage of this.
The pressure of numbers is such that every institution

23

of higher education for the next few foreseeable years
certainly is going to have a tremendous struggle simp-
ly to take care of the demand that is placed upon it.

Because of the numbers, it becomes increasingly
difficult to provide a quality educational experience.
It is very difficult to maintain a curricular program
which provides the highest quality of educational ex-
perience at the same time you're trying to care for the
increase in numbers.

We are also confronted with the explosion of
knowledge that is taking place, not only in our nation
but throughout the world. It is very easy to document
this in many respects. Alfred North Whitehead in
one of his essays made the observation that from the
time of the Roman senator to the time of George
Washington basically life did not change much. True,
there were new insights, there were new developments.
But Washington rode in a four-wheeled horse-drawn
vehicle, as did the Roman senator. He lived in the
same kind of world so far as material things were con-
cerned. ‘The tremendous revolution that has taken
place in our material world in the last century and a
half would be beyond comprehension by anyone who
had not experienced a portion of it. The increase in
scientific knowledge can be documented in our own
experiences. Coming up here, I was thinking about a
course in freshman physics that I took, in which un-
fortunately I didn’t learn too much. One thing that I
learned as an axiom was that the atom was the small-
est particle of matter and was indivisible. Thirty years
ago. Think of all of the tremendous strides that have
come in that period of time. We have developing in
our educational institutions a great pressure for un-
covering new knowledge and the development of new
facts and new materials.

The Need for Teaching Balance

‘The research programs of most of our institutions
provide a kind of threat to the teaching program of
our institutions. One of the hardest jobs of a college
administrator is to maintain some kind of balance
between the research enterprise and the teaching en-
terprise. And it’s a source of great comfort and, at
least, of great encouragement to me as an educator to
know that this institution has continued to emphasize,
primarily, the teaching function. Research, as it con-
tributes to better teaching, as it increases the capacity
of the instructor, is of great importance but it is not
to be a substitute for teaching responsibility.

We find great problems in the financing of higher
education today. As was noted last night by Dean At-
wood, there seems to be a rather general unwilling-
ness on the part of a large segment of the American
population to adequately finance our educational sys-

24

tem. We are confronted by rising costs, tremendously
rising costs. ‘The University of Chicago in the year
1940 was able to devote $100 of expense money to
each biology professor. By 1960 it was necessary to
budget $50,000 per biology professor at that Univer-
sity. The same kind of cost increase can be seen in ev-
ery aspect of American higher education today. When
Michelson in 1887 performed his experiment leading
to the measuring of the speed of light he contributed
significantly to scientific advance. Firty years later it
was decided in observing the anniversary of this event
that the experiment should be repeated. And it was
repeated at a cost of twenty times more than it cost
originally to do the work.

We are confronted by great numbers, we are con-
fronted by a real problem in maintaining quality be-
cause of the shortage in teachers and instructors. We
are confronted by the demands for the extension of
knowledge, and the great explosion of knowledge. We
are confronted by the worries and the concerns of
financing higher education. But these are things that
are of concern to everyone. Largely, in a situation like
this, we come back to personal memories and the desire
for some kind of personal analysis.

“Did We Get an Education?”

‘The main thesis of what I would like to share with
you today is a second question. It is not “Are we get-
ting an education?” but “Did we get an education?”
Did we, who shared together these experiences at
Washington and Lee, come out with what we can truly
call an education? I think we would probably have
difficulty in defining what we meant by “an educa-
tion.” Our answer to this question is impressionistic
at best, with only one or two little points we can draw
together. May I, from the perspective of one who
wrote an article twenty-five years ago and who wishes
to bring it up to date at this moment, share with you
what I feel personally was so helpful to me at Wash-
ington and Lee; and share with you that for which I
shall be eternally thankful.

In terms of my own experience here, I am grateful
particularly for the fact that at Washington and Lee
the individual was important. I recognized that in the
article, because I said we can all be thankful that
Washington and Lee ascribes to the philosophy of
Ralph Waldo Emerson who said: ‘““The secret of edu-
cation lies in respecting the pupil.” It is true of Wash-
ington and Lee throughout its history that it has al-
ways respected the pupil. This is not true of every
educational institution. This is not true of every Am-
erican college today. It is true in some measure, I am
sure, of faculty members in every institution but there
are many in American higher education who are the

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

proponents of knowledge for knowledge’s sake with-
out any reference to the individual.

‘This institution stands in a tradition which exalts
the worth of the human personality, which says that as
a child of God this personality is of infinite worth
and which maintains that the job that we have to do
is a job with individuals. Because of that, all of us, I
am sure, can say together that during our student
days here we didn’t feel that we were just a number.
Oh, it may be true that during the first 10 days we
might have felt lost. It may have been that in the first
few days away from home we were not sure there was
any kind of stability that we could find for oureslves
in this situation. But at least “gg and 44/100’s per
cent” of us very soon found that we were accepted
here by the faculty and by fellow students as individu-
als. We were accepted as persons of worth.

We were given the kind of deep belief and convic-
tion which was held by those with whom we were
associated. I am grateful that this institution was in-
terested in me as a whole person and that it was not
simply concerned with my intellectual goal. I’ve al-
ready commented about the retrospective view of some
of the extra curricular activities. This institution has
never said that man is simply a creature with a brain.
It has recognized that he is a social being, that he is
a moral being, and that he is a spiritual being. And
it has tried to produce, in an educational environ-
ment, a series of experiences which would be beneficial
to the growth and to the development and the highest
attainment in all of these realms.

An “Amalgamated Son of Rest’

I am grateful at this moment that Washington and
Lee demanded of me hard, substantial work. I prob-
ably was not as grateful thirty years ago. I think that
I was probably one of those who sought always to
align himself with the Amalgamated Sons of Rest
while he was enrolled in this institution. Like many of
you, I went through the catalogue and tried to pick
out the “crip” courses in order that I might have a
rather easy educational experience. I am glad now that
I found that there were very few of those. Even those
which were pointed out to me by others as being easy
courses in the final analysis did not turn out to be.

If you look back over your experience here, as I
have been looking back over mine the last couple of
weeks, you do honor to those men who required hard
work of you, who made you sweat, who made you run
scared, and who, therefore, enriched your lives to a
degree that could never have been possible if you had
simply been allowed to coast. In a day and in an age
when such an overwhelming number of people are try-
ing to find ways and means to get by with as little ex-
penditure of energy as possible, I celebrate the fact

SUMMER 1964

that this institution has stood for the requirement of
hard and diligent work. And I am grateful to it for
having demanded that of me.

I am grateful for the fact that this institution has
always had a high concern for the values of life. One il-
lustration will suffice—to call to your mind the em-
phasis which was placed here on honor and the honor
system. I know other institutions where honor in class-
room work is almost non-existent. Indeed, I fear the
tendency which seems to be increasing in higher edu-
cation today for young people to find the ways and the
means by which they can somehow get around doing
something; the willingness to lie and cheat, simply
to get a grade. There is abroad a kind of moral rela-
tivism which I think personally stems in large measure
from Marxist philosophy and the influence it’s had on
American thought, subtly; a belief that there is no
such thing as right or wrong, the belief that this is
simply a matter for the individual and whatever the
individual may decide is right for himself.

The Discipline of Honor

Although there may have been situations in which
the honor system seemed to be tough or even unjust,
I celebrate the fact that I participated in a tradition
and in a heritage that demanded rigorous standards
of honor and which would brook no compromise when
it came to honesty. I feel that the stand which was
taken in behalf of the value of honesty by this institu-
tion is one of the greatest needs of contemporary so-
ciety today, opposing the belief that nothing is right or
wrong but thinking makes it so. I subscribe to the
philosophy stated in one of the essays of Heywood
Broun when he said: “It is better I believe to be wrong
on occasion than to be forever an inquiring neutral.
There can be such a thing as constructive fanaticism.”
We live in an age which is crying desperately for peo-
ple who are not inquiring neutrals but who are will-
ing to be constructively fanatical in their adherence
to certain standards and certain values. I am grateful
that Washington and Lee permitted me to have an ex-
perience of this type here and to formulate a convic-
tion which I trust will live with me forever.

More particularly, I am grateful for the fact that
here at Washington and Lee I encountered a dedicated
faculty of teachers. ‘There are so many present this
morning that I’m going to avoid naming anyone be-
cause I am sure to overlook someone. I wrote in the
little article something that I’d like to take back at
this time. I put in here that “at Washington and Lee
among the faculty members we have many strenuous
minds but few rich ones.” I retract that statement to-
day. I retract it because I had no basis really for mak-
ing the observation at that time. I had not been to a
number of institutions and I had not really formu-

2)

lated a definition of what constituted a rich mind. It
was a good sounding phrase to a college senior and per-
haps I was overwhelmed by the sound of the phrase
itself rather than the content.

In retrospect, I knew many rich minds here at
Washington and Lee, many dedicated teachers. Car-
lyle said that “the true university is a collection of
books” but in my own experience I qualify that by
adding that the true university is also a collection of
great people. For the books have to be interpreted and
the books have to be given to the student with a cer-
tain amount of guidance. I have often said that edu-
cation is something that you catch from other people,
even more than it is something that you are able to
dig out of a book. I celebrate the professor here who
opened the Old Testament for me and made some ob-
scure phrases and some obscure figures of speech live.
I celebrate the professor who opened Shakespeare’s
work for me and who made the plays of Shakespeare
live because the characters paraded across the front of
the classroom. I owned a copy of the Old Testament
and I owned a copy of Shakespeare but I would never
have received what I have from these books if it had
not been for the magnificent interpretation and the
spirit which was conveyed by faculty members and
those who guided me in this institution.

As I survey the teaching profession today I am
concerned by the fact that there seem to be more and
more individuals who are viewing it as a profession
rather than a vocation, who look upon it as a means
of earning a living, much more than they do a com-
mitment to the future. When you analyze educational
achievement in terms of the student semester hours
produced by the individual faculty member, when
you equate quantity of work with guality, when you
recruit men whose interest is purely in research and
whose concern is not the human being, you begin to
do a great disservice to higher education. Arthur
Guiterman wrote a little verse about Mark Hopkins.
He said:

‘Mark Hopkins sat on one end of the log,

And a school boy sat on the other;

Mark Hopkins came as a pedagogue

But he taught as an older brother.

I don’t care what Mark Hopkins taught,

If his Latin was small or his Greek was naught,

I only know that the schoolboy, thought,
thought he,

All through the lecture time and quiz,

The kind of a man I'd like to be

Is the kind of a man Mark Hopkins is.”

I celebrate the fact that I encountered here great
spirits. Great spirits who not only broadened my in-
tellectual and social horizon but individuals, the qual-
ity of whose life I could emulate. The kind of a man
I'd like to be is the kind of a man so many of those
were. And so I retract my statement and I express my
gratitude for the fact that I did have an encounter
with so very many rich minds.

Finally, I am grateful for the fact that Washing-
ton and Lee has always placed an emphasis on the
place of great faith and the necessity of belief in God
Almighty. Outside this Chapel, just over here, is the
white tomb of William Graham. “He was distinguished
for his strength and the originality of his genius, and
the successful tenor of his exertions in behalf of solid
literature and evangelical piety.” I had to memorize
that when I was being initiated in my fraternity. So
William Graham, the first president of Liberty Hall
Academy, distinguished for solid literary achievement
and evangelical piety, for his great belief in the worth
of human beings, belief in the divinity of this universe,
and belief in the guiding hand of God Almighty in the
direction of the affairs of men, has been characteris-
tic of this institution.

The great spirit who rests in this Chapel under-
took the building of this edifice for the worship of
Almighty God as the first and most important contri-
bution that he could make to Washington College.
You and I inherited a tradition but we inherited
more—an example—and it is because of this that our
lives have been stamped indelibly with the imprint
of this faith.

Our Obligation to the Future

‘There is a final word. It has been said that that
which we have received from our fathers we must pass
on to others before we can truly call it our own. You
and I who have received so much cannot be satisfied
with having been the recipients of the gift. Ours is
an obligation to see that future generations also have
this. It is descriptive of alumni of the past and it is
descriptive of those who have served Washington and
Lee that in the words of Cicero “They care more for
the long age which is to come than for their own small
share of time.” If there is one resolve that might
come out of our fellowship and our association, in ad-
dition to the expression of our word of gratitude for
what we have received, it is the resolve that those who
come after will also enjoy the kind of blessing which
has been ours.

A Memorable Event

1964 General Reunion—the
fourth such big affair held since the
practice was started in 1949—was
not much of a success. Aside from
the several dozen local alumni who
took part, there were just some 175
other former students on hand for
the three-day program June 11-13.

But in terms of the good time
that was enjoyed by those who did
come, the reunion was every bit a
success that its planning committee
had intended.

The 1914 reunion was unusually
well-attended, with 30 of 61 living
members present under the organi-
zational leadership of Roger J.
Bear.

The “senior” alumnus present
was Dr. Samuel B. McPheeters, of
Goldsboro, N. C., a member of the
Class of 1900. He and his wife set
a lively pace that many of the
younger men couldn’t hold.

In addition to the Class banquets
for the anniversary classes, there
were general receptions in Evans

Hall and at the President’s House,
and there was a luncheon in Evans
Hall where the reunion heard from
President Cole.

Said President Cole:

“We have been privileged to be a
part of the spirit, the enduring
glory of Washington and Lee. The
long line of great men who have
served this University are respon-
sible for is glorious past and _ its

Dr. KENNETH P. STEVENS

Dr. HENRY S. ROBERTS

Dr. Stevens Retires

As Biology Professor

R. KENNETH P. STEVENS retired
D this June as head of the De-
partment of Biology after eighteen
years on the Washington and Lee
faculty.

He will continue to teach a sec-
ond semester advanced course in
biology, but the direction of the
department has been turnd over
to his successor, Dr. Henry S.
Roberts.

Dr. Stevens is best known to the
many Washington and Lee men
who undertook pre-medical studies
under his guidance and counsel. He
joined the faculty in 1946, at a
time when many veterans were
among Washington and Lee’s stu-
dent body. Reflecting on the eight-
een years he has been at the Uni-
versity, Dr. Stevens noted that the
students of 1946 were not as well
prepared academically as_ today’s
students, but he said that they had
a greater seriousness of purpose.

Dr. Stevens has worked actively
with many phases of University life.

30

Committee work has involved him
with fraternities, musical and dra-
matic organizations, lectures, erad-
uate fellowships, and the courses
and degrees program of the Univer-
sity.

When senior Art Broadus was
selected as the Gilliam Award win-
ner this year, he designated that
the cash stipend be used to pur-
chase books for the Biology Library
in honor of Dr. Stevens.

A native of Danbury, Conn., Dr.
Stevens received both A.B. and
M.A. degrees from Wesleyan Uni-
versity, and earned his Ph.D. degree
at Princeton.

Before coming to Washington
and Lee, he taught at New York
Military Academy, Princeton, and
Central College. He is a member
of Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Chi,
and Alpha Epsilon Delta, honor-
ary pre-medical fraternity which he
has served as a national vice-presi-
dent.

 

 

g@ A NEW HEAD of the Department of
Biology was announced in May by
Dean of the College William W.
Pusey, III, along with the names of
ten other men who will join the
University faculty in September.

Dr. Henry S. Roberts, 51, now
associate professor of zoology and
acting director of graduate study in
zoology at Duke University, will be-
come professor of biology, succeed-
ing Dr. Kenneth P. Stevens as head
of Washington and Lee’s biology
program. Dr. Stevens retired in
June after eighteen years on the
University faculty.

Also named by Dean Pusey were
two new assistant professors and
eight new instructors, including
one who will hold the title of
“artist in residence.”

Appointments as assistant profes-
sors include Sterling M. Boyd, 30,
in fine arts, and George W. Ray, 32,
in English.

Appointed instructor in fine
arts was Ray Prohaska, 63, noted
New York painter and illustrator
who will become “artist in resi-
dence” at Washington and Lee
next year.

Other new instructors for 1964-
65 include:

John M. Evans, 28, English; John
P. Freeman, 27, chemistry; William
E. Hannum, 24, English; Irving M.
Lynn, Jr., 24, German; Larry A.
Schmucker, 30, philosophy; Sydney
J. Willams, Jr., 26, Romance
languages; and Anthony Wood, 25,
history.

Dean Pusey said the new faculty
members include replacements for
professors on leave as well as new
additions to the University’s teach-
ing staff.

Wood, who is working toward a
Ph.D. degree at Duke, and Wil-
liams, engaged in similar graduate
study at the University of North
Carolina, are replacements for Dr.
Leon F. Sensabaugh, professor of

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

 

history, and Dr. C. Westbrook Bar-
ritt, professor of Romance lan-
guages. Dr. Sensabaugh and Dr.
Barritt will engage in post-doctor-
al research and study at Duke and
North Carolina next year under a
special cooperative fellowship pro-
gram sponsored by the Ford Foun-
dation. Freeman will replace Dr.
George S. Whitney, assistant profes-
sor of chemistry, who will spend
next year in Switzerland engaged in
research.

a TWO WASHINGTON AND LEE profes-
sors have been named fellows in a
Cooperative Program in the Hu-
manities sponsored jointly by Duke
University and the University of
North Carolina.

Dr. C. Westbrook Barritt, profes-
sor of romance languages, and Dr.
Leon F. Sensabaugh, professor of
history, will participate in the pro-
eram during the 1964-65 academic
year.

Made possible by a five year
grant from the Humanities and
Arts Program of the Ford Founda-
tion to Duke University and the
University of North Carolina, the
program will allow Dr. Barritt and
Dr. Sensabaugh to do research in
their fields of interest at either in-
stitution.

‘The program, operating for the
first time this fall, is planned to
give distinguished faculty members
in the humanities a year to study
and do research in their particular
fields of interest.

‘Two advanced graduate students
from Duke or North Carolina will
be appointed to the Washington
and Lee faculty for the academic
year as replacements for Dr. Barritt
and Dr. Sensabaugh.

® ROBERT STEWART, professor of
Fine Arts, has been selected for
membership in the American Com-
posers Alliance.

Professor Stewart, whose compo-
sitions have been played for New
York audiences four times during

SUMMER 1964

the past academic year, becomes
one of only 130 professional com-
posers of concert music who hold
membership in the ACA. Purposes
of the organization include the pro-
tection of the rights of member
composers and the promotion of
the use and understanding of their
music.

Professor Stewart’s current com-
positions are “serial music,’’ con-
sisting of variations and departures
from the twelve-tone technique
which was first introduced and de-
veloped by Arnold Schoenberg.

Professor Stewart joined the
Washington and Lee faculty in
1954. In addition to his teaching
duties, he also directs the Univer-
sity’s 60-voice Glee Club and its
John Graham Brass Choir. He is
an accomplished violinist and a
graduate of the American Conser-
vatory of Music in Chicago.

mer—once for professional achieve-
ment and again for civic contribu-
tions.

‘The International Graphics Arts
Education Association presented
Mr. Lauck with a certificate of ap-
preciation for his contributions to
the professional association. ‘The
inscription said, in part:

“Recognizing the multitude of

Association for the 264 degree can-
diates.

Broadus was recognized for out-
standing service to the school and
specifically for. his work as_presi-
dent of the Interfraternity Coun-
cil during the past year. During his

ArT Broapus accepts the Gilliam Award
at the Alumni Senior Banquet.

Alpha; was a member of the Dance
Board and the Liberty Hall (liter-
ary) Society; and was a Dean’s List
and Honor Roll student as a pre-
med major.

Established in February, 1963,
the Gilliam Award includes a per-
manent plaque in the University’s
Student Union building for win-
ners’ names. ‘The award is financed
by the Student Body Fund which
is supported by the University’s stu-
dent activities fees.

The award carries a $100 stipend
plus the privilege of designating
another $150 for use by an organi-
zation or academic department of
the University. Broadus designated
that the $150 be used to purchase
books for the biology department
library in honor of Dr. Kenneth
P. Stevens, who retired in June.

mw THE QUALITY of undergraduate
scientific research at Washington
and Lee was underscored when
thirteen students read papers be-
fore the annual meeting of the Vir-
ginia Academy of Science in May.

More undergraduates from Wash-
ington and Lee than from any
other Virginia institution reported
the findings of their research to the
academy. Generally only graduate
students, professors and profession-
al researchers report to sessions of
the academy.

Research for the papers read by
Washington and Lee undergradu-
ates was done under grants from
the National Science Foundation
and the university's own Robert
FE. Lee Research Program which
was established in 1960 to encour-
age well qualified students to be-
come familiar with research tools,
techniques and methods.

Students who helped prepare
papers read to the astronomy,
mathematics, and physics section
of the Academy were James S. Lege,
Jr.. junior from Webster Groves,
Mo.; Alonzo Atkins, Jr... senior
irom Gadsden, Ala.; and Robert
A. Paddock, senior from Redding,
Conn. Directing their research was
Dr. ‘Thomas Ratchford, assistant
professor of physics.

The chemistry section heard pa-
pers by G. Ashley Allen, junior
from Chester, S.C.; Thomas W.
Fauntleroy, Jr., sophomore from
Coraopolis, Pa.; Cary J. Hansel,
freshman from Falls Church, Va.;
Kenneth G. Everett, senior from
Bastrop, La.; Robert L. Cafferata,
senior from Forest Hills, N. Y.; F.
Scott Kennedy, sophomore from
Shreveport, La.; and David L. My-
ers, Junior from Roanoke. Profes-
sors directing their research were
Dr. John H. Wise, Dr. W. J. Watt,
Dr. James K. Shillington, Dr. E. S.
Gilreath and Dr. George S. Whit-
ney.

Students reading papers to the
psychology section of the academy
were Robert E. Lee, ITI, junior
from Glendale, Calif.; Rodney L.
Stump, senior from Pulaski, Va.;
and Kenneth A. Marion, junior
from Blountville, Tenn. Profes-
sors directing their research were
Dr. William M. Hinton and Dr. L.
FE. Jarrard.

& WASHINGTON AND LEE’S fraternity
rush system this fall will reflect
what many students consider a ma-
jor revamping.

By action of the Interfraternity

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

 

 

Council, 1964 freshmen will be
asked to designate fraternities they
wish to see at “open house” during
the first two days of rush. This will
replace the traditional ‘rush’ into
the dormitories to persuade fresh-
men to visit fraternity houses.

After the first two days, a sub-
dued form of the old rushing for-
mat will be followed. The fraterni-
ties will rush in dormitories but
only four members of each frater-
nity will be allowed in the fresh-
man quardrangle. Freshmen will
then sign up to visit fraternities at
formal rush dates.

During the first two days of rush-
ing, there will be six open houses
each night, from 7 to 11, lasting
for forty minutes each. During
these first two days, no rushee will
be allowed to see any house more
than once, and he must see a mini-
mum of ten houses. ‘There may be
no more than thirty rushees present
at a chapter during any open house.
Each fraternity will be given a list
of the freshmen who will be present
in advance of its open house.

Rush Week will begin on Thurs-
day, September 10, and end on
Wednesday, September 16, the day
classes begin.

Fraternities are expected to de-
vote considerable summer work to
contacting prospective rushees_ to
insure that they sign up for a cer-
tain house during the “open rush”
dates.

General rush rules concerning
fraternity etiquette, contact with
freshmen, etc., remain the same.
‘The freshman rushing fee has been
raised from $3.00 to $5.00 and there
is a $7.50 fee for late payment.

A new Interfraternity Council
constitution was approved by the
Faculty Committee on Fraternities
and ratified by the IFC itself last
February. he new constitution
gave increased disciplinary power to
the IFC, but made no changes in
Rush Week. Changes in the rushing
system were passed by the IFC in
April.

SUMMER 1964

 

New Rush Week regulations could put an end to this familiar scene of annual mayhem
and bloodshed.

 

& WASHINGTON AND LEE’S School of
Law conducted an eight-week sum-
mer session with go students en-
rolled.

A summer curriculum of four

courses was available to students in
two four-week terms, beginning
June 22. Participating professors
included Dr. Wilfred J. Ritz, Pro-
fessor Charles R. McDowell, Pro-
fessor J. William Stewart, and
Professor Robert E. R. Huntley,
all of the school’s regular faculty.

‘The Law School session is the
only summer work offered at Wash-

w A GRANT Of $5,000 to Washington
and Lee by the Merck Company
Foundation of Rahway, N. J., was
announced in June by President
Fret: C., Gole.

President Cole said the Founda-
tion made its grant in support of
the University’s Robert E. Lee Re-
search Program for Undergradu-
ates, now in its fourth year.

The grant will help support

faculty and student research pro-
jects which bring professors and
students together in research rela-
tionships seldom encountered at
the undergraduate level.

Referring to the program’s broad
application in the humanities and
social sciences, as well as the sci-
ences, a foundation official wrote
President Cole: “This is indeed an
interesting departure in an era
when the primary emphasis in re-
search seems to be in fields of sci-
ences’

In acknowledging the grant,
President -Cole. wrote’ ‘to-: Merck
Company Foundation officials: “I
am particularly gratified also to
know that you and your associates
are concerned, as we are, with the
attempt to bring appropriate bal-
ance into research programs in the
colleges and universities. Your sup-
port will allow us to bring an even
better emphasis in all disciplines
here than we have been able to ac-
complish. before.”

President Cole said the grant
“comes at a very timely moment
when we are making plans for some
of our students to carry on re-
search and study projects with their
professors in the course of the sum-

summer camp.

Football Generals Face Slim
Prospects For 1964 Season

HEN Washington and _ Lee’s

ve unusually optimistic Coach

Lee McLaughlin takes a rather dim

view of the prospects for the com-

ing season, chances are that the

Generals are in for a struggle in
1964.

Despite the return of some
twenty-nine lettermen, McLaughlin
says the Generals will be plagued
with a lack of experience in many
key positions. He points to the loss
of the entire starting offensive unit
from last year’s team which won
five, lost three.

“We can’t expect to do as well
this year in the won-lost column,”
the Washington and Lee coach
sums up, “but I hope we're going
to be able to play some interesting
ball just the same.”

McLaughlin says he expects
the Generals to pass more in 1964,
relying on the aerial attack as an
integral part of the overall offense.
In recent years, Washington and
Lee has tended to run to the pass
only for the long gainer or scoring
thrust.

“We hope to keep the opponents’
defenses a little more honest than

34

 

we have been doing,” he points out.

Among the top returning players
are Co-captains Bill David and
‘Tom Crenshaw, both senior right
half-backs. David is a pass-catching
and defensive specialist who may
see most action as a split-end, while
Crenshaw is a powerful runner.
Both figure heavily in McLaugh-
lin’s hopes for a rebuilt General at-
tack.

In other sports news, top athletic
awards were handed out to Wash-
ington and Lee students at the an-
nual Sports Barbecue held at the
summer camp of Coach McLaugh-
lin.

Brice Gamber, a senior from
Baltimore, received the ‘Wink’
Glasgow ‘Trophy as the student
displaying the qualities of Wash-
ington and Lee spirit best. Gam-
ber played both football and base-
ball.

John McDaniel, outstanding
quarterback in football and lacrosse
midfielder, was selected as the Uni-
versity’s outstanding varsity athlete.
McDaniel was chosen to play in the
annual national lacrosse All-Star
game this year.

Report of the Annual Meeting

 

Alumni Hear First Report of Plan
To Establish an Alumni House

NNOUNCEMENT OF PLANS for a

Washington and Lee alumni
house and a plea for loyalty to the
University from its former Rector
were highlights of the annual gen-
cral meeting of the Alumni Asso-
clation.

Held Saturday, June 13, in Lee
Chapel as one of the closing events
of the fourth General Alumni Re-
union, the association meeting was
attended by some one hundred
former students, as well as current
officers and members of the Alum-
ni Board of ‘Trustees.

In addition to the annual report
by Executive Secretary William C.
Washburn (see page 41), alumni
heard remarks by outgoing Asso-
ciation President Dr. John D. Bat-
tle, °34; the report of treasurer Wil-
lam B. Wisdom, ’21, of another
banner Alumni Fund year (see
page 38); and a report from the
nominating committee on new
members for the Alumni Board and
the University athletic committee.

Alton B. Sartor, ’38, of Shreve-
port, La., was introduced as the
new association president, along
with Vice-President E. Stewart Ep-
ley, ’49, of New York City and
‘Treasurer E. Marshall Nuckols, Jr.,
33, of Camden, N. J.

Ki Williams, ’15, of Waynesboro,
Va., spoke from the floor, remind-
ing fellow alumni of “social and
political changes” taking place in
the nation that may affect the fu-
ture of Washington and Lee.

It was in response to Mr. Wil-

SUMMER 1964

 

T. B. BRYANT, ’28, left, new President E. ALTON SARTOR, ]R., ’98, and E. Stewart EPLEY
3 a 3
"49, discuss plans for the new alumni center.

liams’ remarks that James R. Cas-
kie, ’o6, of Lynchburg, former
Rector and current member of the
University Board of Trustees, called
on alumni for renewed devotion to
their University.

Both Mr. Williams and Mr. Cas-
kie, who spoke near the close of the
hour-long meeting, drew long ap-
plause from the alumni present.

Biggest news of the meeting in-
volved the first steps to provide
Washington and Lee alumni with
a headquarters house to serve as
the association’s offices and_ its
alumni activities center. President
Battle announced the plans in his
informal summary of his year in
office.

President Battle said the Univer-
sity had offered to the Association
the former home of the late Dr.
Fitzgerald Flournoy, ’21, who died

in January. The home, a_ large
brick structure, is located on the
extreme north side of the Wash-
ington and Lee campus, adjoining
property of Virginia Military In-
stitute on Letcher Avenue.

Battle said a special committee
of the Alumni Board had met in
Lexington in April to consider the
proposal, visited the property and
evaluated the various uses the as-
sociation might make of the build-
ing. He said a new committee, ap-
pointed by President Sartor, would
continue to work on the alumni
house project in close harmony
with members of the University
administration. ‘Che committee will
help determine what functions the
house will serve, the needs it will
meet, and what alterations and re-
modeling will be necessary to adapt
the home for these purposes. It al-

35

so will determine costs and explore
ways the project can be financed, he
said.

President Battle assured the
meeting that members of the Alum-
ni Board were convinced that finan-
cial arrangements should be made
without compromising in any ma-
jor way the annual support of the
University by alumni through the
annual Fund. He promised a full
report to alumni on subsequent
developments in alumni house
planning through future issues of
the Alumni Magazine.

Also in his remarks, President
Battle paid special tribute to the
service to the association by Vice-
President IT. B. Bryant, ’28L, of
Orangeburg, S.C., and ‘Treasurer
Wisdom, ‘21, of New Orleans, both
of whom join Battle in completing
four-year terms on the Alumni
Board.

President Battle read to the
meeting a special resolution pre-
pared by Mr. Wisdom concerning
the death in December of the late

Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines. ‘The
resolution was adopted unanimous-
ly.

In the absence of Nominating
Committee Chairman Barton W.
Morris, ’43, of Roanoke, Dr. Wil-
liam M. Hinton, ’29, of the Uni-
versity faculty, offered the report
of the group. Nominated and sub-
sequently unanimously elected to
four-year terms on the Board were
Francis W. Plowman, 721, of
Swarthmore, Pa.; ‘Thomas C. Frost,
Jr., 50, of San Antonio, ‘Texas; and
James W. Priest, °43, of Dayton,
Ohio. Nominated and elected with-
out opposition to a two-year term
on the University committee on in-
tercollegiate athletics was Norman
L. Dobyns, °54, of Springfield, Va.
(See Page 4o for additional infor-
mation about the new alumni ofh-

cials.)

Mr. Williams urged all alumni
and officers of the association to
keep informed of “social change”
in the nation and to make their
feelings known in a proper manner

 

to the University’s authorities. He
said he felt these problems were a
“family” affair that should be of
concern to all members of the
Washington and Lee family.

In remarks given with great feel-
ing, Mr. Caskie told the audience
that, as a member of the Univer-
sity’s Board, he felt he knew the
sentiments of many alumni. He re-
ferred to General Lee after Ap-
pomattox and how Lee had called
on his soldiers and fellow country-
men to give their loyalty to the re-
stored Union. Mr. Caskie appealed
to alumni to bestow on Washing-
ton and Lee the kind of loyalty Lee
demonstrated himself.

He assured his listeners that the
‘Trustees, in his opinion, were de-
voted to Washington and Lee and
would make no decisions except
those dictated by the best interests
of the University.

“With God’s help to direct and
lead us, Washington and Lee will
continue to be an outstanding in-
fluence on our nation,” he said.

The Alumni Fund
Goes Over the Top!

Alumni Fund Council Chairman Kime
Reports That the Goal of $165,000
Was Reached, Despite a Sight Drop
In the Number of Contributors in 1964

T Is A pleasure for me, on behalf
I of the Alumni Fund Council,
to announce the completion of a
successful and record-breaking AI-
umni Fund Campaign for 1963-
1964.

Nearly a year ago, the Alumni
Fund Council established the rath-
er ambitious goal of $165,000 for
the 1963-1964 drive. Frankly, some
of us had reservations about in-
creasing the goal by $25,000 over
the previous year’s successful ach-
levement. But we felt that the re-
sponsibilities of our membership
on the council dictated that we set
our sights high and that we work
toward this goal with enthusiasm
and diligent effort.

When the books were closed on
June 30, contributions to the Al-
umni Fund for the year totaled
$165,272.42. Never before in the
history of our University had _ al-
umni so generously supported the

38

By Ropert E. Kime, ’51

Chairman,
The Alumni Fund Council

annual fund. Every alumnus, even
those who, for one reason or an-
other, were not among the contrib-
utors this year, can take great
pride in this measure of financial
encouragement which we, the Uni-
versity’s former students, have been
able to offer to our Alma Mater.
When we consider the remark-
able growth of the Alumni Fund
over the past decade, the results of
the past year take on even greater
significance. In 1954-1955, contri-
butions totaled $62,508.27, and
even this reflected a dramatic in-
crease over previous years. In 1957-
1958, the last full year before the
University—with alumni _leader-
ship—undertook the University
Development Program, the Fund
had grown to $113,681.79. Upon
completion of the development
campaign, the Fund was resumed
on a modest but annually growing
scale. ‘Today we can look back on

a growth of over $100,000 above the
1955 level of support.

Who or what is responsible for
this progress? In a word—you.
Whatever may be the contribution
of the Alumni Fund Council mem-
bership, it is littke compared to the
outstanding support which you
have seen fit to give. Special ac-
claim and recognition must go,
certainly, to the hundreds of class
and regional agents who have la-
bored so well and so faithfully to
enlist the help and inspire the in-
terest of thousands of others. I
know my associates on the council
appreciate their efforts more than
words can express, and I know that
everyone who shares our interest
in Washington and Lee joins us in
our heartfelt gratitude.

While there is reason for satis-
faction in the results of the 1963-
64 Fund drive, there is a sober-
ing statistic that causes us concern

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

 

 

and will be a matter of important
concern to the next Alumni Fund
Council. I refer, of course, to the
number of contributors who _par-
ticipated in the recent campaign.

Fewer alumni gave to the 1963-
1964 Fund than the previous year’s
fund drive: only 3,735 this year
as compared with 3,905 last year.
It is most apparent that those who
did give gave generously indeed
for the Fund to achieve such a lofty
new level.

The sobering aspect of these fig-
ures concerns the number who did
not respond to our appeal for sup-
port. Of the 10,924 alumni who
were contacted, 7,189 persons chose
not to participate, or neglected, or

 

forgot the opportunity to assist the
University in an important way.

When the drive began last au-
tumn, you will recall that we re-
flected on some of the reasons why
alumni do support the Alumni
Fund. ‘Today, I’m inclined to think
about some of the reasons why such
a large number have not given.

(It should be pointed out that
the participation totals for Wash-
ington and Lee, when compared
with most colleges and universities,
are very good. Not the best, but
very good. But because so many of
us think of what happened to us
at Washington and Lee as some-
thing special in our lives, we also

SUMMER 1964

like to think that Washington and
Lee alumni are capable of reacting
to the needs of their growing Uni-
versity in a special way.)

Perhaps some who do not give
feel that their gift must, of neces-
sity, be small, and hence, not real-
ly important. Nothing could be
less true. What is important is that
the alumnus has cared enough to
give something.

Perhaps some feel that Wash-
ington and Lee is doing all right
without their help, that whatever
their gift might be, it won’t be real-
ly useful. Again, this is not true.
No college or university—not even
giants like Harvard or the Univer-
sity of California—has — sufficient

funds to achieve as much signifi-
cant progress in higher education
as its trustees, administration, fac-
ulty, and alumni hope for. Wash-
ington and Lee can put to vital
use every penny for additional fi-
nancial aid for’ students, for
strengthening the faculty, for im-
proving the instructional facilities.
Your gift 7s needed.

Perhaps some believe that high-
er education as a whole can take
care of itself, drawing substantial
support from the giant foundations
and from the government. I hope
any who feel this way might consid-
er the role of the privately-sup-
ported institutions, the traditional

 

balance they have given to our
system of diversified higher educa-
tion, and to the traditional sources
of their strength. Their strength
has come and _ still comes from
those who know these schools most
intimately, men who have known
first hand the value of the educa-
tional opportunity which these
schools can give. If these men lose
faith in their Alma Maters, or show
apparent loss of faith through in-
difference or neglect, then the fu-
ture of the privately-supported col-
lege will be in grave danger.
Soon, we shall face the renewed
challenge of a new Alumni Fund.
Those of us who accept the respon-
sibility of membership on the AI-

“If these men lose faith

in their Alma Maters, or show
an apparent loss of faith
through indifference or neglect,
then the future of the privately-
supported college will be in

grave danger.”

—Chairman Rosert E. Kime, ’51

umni Fund Council can look ahead
with confidence. We can draw in-
spiration from the past year, from
the past decade, and from 216 years
of our University’s history. The
challenge and opportunity for con-
tinued growth are undiminished.
We need only to find the words and
action that will bring others to rec-
ognize the opportunity and neces-
sity for building an ever-stronger
Washington and Lee University.

Again, I want to thank every-
one—I wish I could do it personal-
ly—who helped make this past year
one of the most personally satisfy-
ing efforts I have ever made on
behalf of our University.

SUMMER 1964

Secretary Wm. Washburn’s

Report Reflects Important

Growth of the Association

By WiLLIAM C. WASHBURN

Executive Secretary

T IS ALWAYS a pleasure for me to
I report on the activities of the
Alumni Association which, in my
opinion, shows steady progress, and
it is particularly gratifying when
I can report another successful year.

Last year, you will remember, I

reported a record for the Alumni

Fund, both in terms of money re-
ceived and contributors participat-
ing. This year I am happy to say
that we have already set another
record for the total, and it is indeed
possible that we will reach a new
level of participation. As of this
morning the fund has _ reached
$147,488. (Last year on July 1 it was
$140,000.) Now the goal for this
year was $165,000, so we have some
climbing to do yet before the end
of the fiscal year on June goth. But
we can all take pride, I think, in
the fact that the total fund has set
a new record.

Let me pause to pay special
thanks to all who have worked, and
who are still working, so hard to
make this success. What levels we
reach are due to the splendid co-
operation of so many—from Presi-
dent Cole and the entire adminis-
tration, the Alumni Board of Trus-
tees, the Alumni Fund Council
(and a special thanks to Bob Kime
who headed this Council), from the
faculty, and especially from the
ninety-three class agents and the
literary hundreds of regional ag-
ents and workers who even this
very day are working for Washing-

ton and Lee. I cannot overempha-
size the importance of each and
every one of these groups, nor can
I possibly express all the thanks
that are in my heart and, I know,
in yours also.

A word of caution might be en-
tered here. We have noted it in
past years. While we seem to have
success in the total amount of funds
raised, we need very badly to in-
crease the number of alumni who
participate. As of right now, we
have about thirty-two per cent of
those who are solicited actually
participating. Just think what
could be done if we could raise
this percentage—not only in terms
of financial support, but more es-
pecially in terms of overall interest
and dedication to Washington and
Lee.

Let me say to those who wonder
about our statistics that to the best
of my knowledge we define an al-
umnus in the very same way that
every other college does. Some col-
leges and universities, the ones with
which we alumni normally like to
compare ourselves, are getting par-
ticipation percentages much higher
than ours. Now I realize this is
more my problem and the Fund
Council’s—but it is also yours! You
should be aware of this and go back
to your home community with re-
newed effort and determination to
pass the word—to do what you can
individually to help encourage
more participation.

41

 

I wonder if I might inject a sad
but maybe pertinent note right
here: Last ‘Tuesday Washington
and Lee’s oldest alumnus passed
away. Dr. Leslie Lyle Compbell,
class of 1887 and born in Septem-
ber, 1863, died here in Lexington.
He would have been 101 years old
this coming September. He was a
perfectly wonderful old gentleman
and a distinguished alumnus. I
have called on him several times
recently in his home, and it was al-
ways an inspiration to me. Ihe
spirit, love, and devotion he held
for Washington and Lee were truly
wonderful. It is his type of devo-
tion—his type of active interest—
that we must awaken in all who
share in Washington and Lee.

There are many other parts of
alumni association work. Those of
you who are here today can look
around your campus and see the

tremendous growth of the physical
plant. Let me assure you that simi-
lar progress can be found in the
academic program, in student ac-
tivities, and in all other phases of
college life. Through the Alumni
Magazine we have tried to keep the
alumni advised of this growth. The
magazine is now being mailed quar-
terly to 11,200 alumni. This year
we had even larger issues than last
year—two 48-page issues, one large
56-page issue (the largest since I’ve
been here), and a 32-page issue. We
find that there is more and more
to tell about your University; we
are using more pictures to help tell
the University’s story. ‘The maga-
zine continues to be our main chan-
nel of communication. We hope
you enjoy it.

The association has, I am happy
to report, added two new chapters
this year and there are two more in
the planning stage. I personally

have traveled to a great many of
these chapters this year, and on
quite a few trips I have accompan-
ied Dean Gilliam. Members of the
faculty and other representatives of
the University have visited many
chapters. I honestly feel that we are
doing well on this score. I assure
you that all on the faculty and staff
at the University are willing and
eager to visit the field chapters-—
of course, within the limits of their
academic load. What I am trying
to say here is that, in my opinion,
we can be quite happy about our
chapter organization. I feel as
though there is new vigor and
interest manifested throughout the
chapters.

Your association continues in its
traditional activities. All are very,
very important, but I shall just
mention them. The Association
takes an active part in Freshman
Camp; with the help of IBM we

 

Sons of alumni graduating in 1964 included these seniors: standing, l-r, W. H. Kipp, III; R. M. Roperts, Jr. T. C. Lewis; F. W.
Wricut; P. D. SHARP, JR.; G. B. SPAULDING; W. J. SmitH; J. H. Harpwick, JRr.; and A. E. BroApus. Proud fathers, l-r, are R. M. Ros-
ERTS, 43; C. I. Lewis, ’g0; ‘IT. P. Wricut, ’29; P. D. SHARP, ’31; G. M. SPAULDING, "34; J. C. Smirn, ’91; J. H. HArpwick, ’31; and T. H.
BROADUS, ’25.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

 

 

continue to service fraternities
faster with better records. Home-
coming was a big success this year,
as was the Mock Convention in
which your Association helped to
some degree. The Randolph ‘Tuck-
er Law Lectures was another oc-
casion for the gathering of alumni
for intellectual inspiration as well
as good fellowship. ‘The Senior
Banquet was held again this year
and, of course, this very Reunion
is now in progress.

Perhaps our biggest project this
year is the Directory. This turned
out to be a much larger undertak-
ing than we figured. We have been
working very hard and devoting
every spare minute to it. Here let
me pause to mention the Alumni
Office staff. We’ve attempted to do
this Directory without too much
outside clerical help. It has meant
a large extra load for everyone in
my office, and I know you will join
me in publicly expressing every

thanks. ‘The Directory is ninety-

been for the Mock Convention and

ed it. Our target date now is July
15th, when we will crate it all up
and ship it to the publishers. ‘They
have estimated early September as
a time when they can start sending
us the completed Directory. I'll not
stop to describe the contents. I'll
just say that it will be a paper-
bound book of approximately 392
pages, containing an alphabetical
section, a class section, and a geo-
graphic section.

These are just a few of the phases
in which your Association has op-
erated this year. For the future, the
horizons hold great promise and
excitement. One of these exciting
plans is the prospect of our long-
awaited Alumni House. In the
president’s report I am sure he will
want to tell you of those plans. It
is enough for me to report here that

 

we are finally on the road to doing
something definite toward the es-
tablishment of a very nice Alum-
ni House. I am sure that you will
be interested in what President Bat-
tle reports and in the future reports
which will be coming forth from
the Alumni Board of Trustees.

In closing, let me say how much
I have enjoyed this year. As I look
back, I see definite progress. There
is much yet to be done, and I look
forward to this with excitement.
Washington and Lee is steadily
going forward. Our Alumni Asso-
ciation must keep up the pace.

I want to express my _ thanks
again to President Cole and all
Universtiy officials and faculty; to
the Alumni Board of ‘Trustees; to
Bob Kime and the Alumni Fund
Council; the absolute army of

chapter officials, class and regional
agents; and to all who have given
so unselfishly of their time and
talents to make this a great year.

Indians of the Confederacy. On “Law Day”
held on May 1, 1964, in Little Rock, the
Hon. Richard C. Butler paid tribute to
Judge Lemley. He described him, in the
words of Sir ‘Thomas More, as ‘“‘a man for
all seasons.” Judge Lemley was en-
gaged in the active practice of law at
Hope from 1912 to 1939 when he was

ered one of the country’s outstanding au-
thorities on the history of the Civil War

WILLIAM A. HYMAN, an _ internationally

collaboration with the Sloan-Kettering
Institute, have been conducting cancer
experiments without the patients’ “‘in-
formed consent in writing.” Hyman, a di-
rector of the Chronic Disease Hospital
since 1925, insists he favors hospital re-
search, but only if the patients have full
understanding and are capable of giving
meaningful consent. ‘The experiments
came to Hyman’s attention when three
doctors resigned. Mr. Hvyman’s_§accusa-
tions triggered a state investigation re-
sulting in an order by the State Supreme
Court that the Chronic Disease Hospital

IsAAc M. ScHer has been working as a
newspaperman for fourteen years since

Roger Mudd, °50, Newsman in the News

# ROGER MUDD, 50, for several years
one of CBS News’ hardest working
correspondents, apparently has
come into his own as something of
a ‘I'V personality.

Folks who watched the CBS cov-
erage of the long civil rights debate
in the senate saw enough of Mudd
to establish life-long attachments
to the pleasant, knowledgeable
former Washington and Lee _ his-
tory student.

Newsweek took note of Mudd’s
long exposure—both to the viewing
public and the elements—in_ this
way in its June 22 issue with an ar-
ticle tagged ‘“‘Mudd Into Gold:”

“When historians record the saga
of the civil-rights bill of 1964, a
CBS newsman named Roger Mudd
will certainly merit at least a rich
footnote. Since March 30, Mudd,
whose basic salary is only $75 a
week, has been actually earning
$2,100 weekly bringing spot coy-
erage of the debate to CBS radio
and ‘TV audiences.

40

EDITOR’S NOTE: After this article was
prepared, even greater national recogni-
tion came to Roger Mudd when he was
chosen by CBS news to serve with Robert
Trout as “anchor men” for the network’s
TV coverage of the Democratic National
Convention in Atlantic City.

 

RoGER Muppb, ’50

“The idea that spawned this flow
of wealth to Mudd belonged to
Fred W. Friendly, head of CBS
News. Friendly decided that he
would assign one reporter to cover
the filibuster until it ended. “As
the idea was first explained to me,
it sounded like a flagpole-sitting
stunt, said Mudd last week.

“What makes Mudd’s patrol so
lucrative is television’s ‘fee system.’
Under it, T'V and radio newsmen
are paid for each appearance,
usually $17.50 for radio spots and
$38.50 for ‘I'V spots, and by his
own count Mudd has been averag-
ing at least six television and sev-
en radio appearances a day, five
days a week, for almost eleven
weeks.

“On a typical day last week the
36-year-old Mudd arrived at the
Capitol at about 9:30 a.m. to pre-
pare for the one-minute spot at 10.
After that and an 11 a.m. spot, he
joined the Cloture Club, a group
of reporters who interview the
senate leaders. At noon, he did an

many hazards. At left he is

updater for CBS’s local station,
WTOP-TV, for which he worked
from 1956 until 1961. After lunch,
he wandered around the Senate cor-
ridors gathering information and
then did four or five more spots.
When cloture came last Wednes-
day, Mudd stood outside the Sen-
ate wing and announced the vote
with what a friend described as
‘the happiest face I’ve ever seen.’
Whether his joy was due to the
outcome of the debate or the end
of a long assignment remains in
Mudd’s mind. A scrupulously im-
partial reporter, he has never re-
vealed his personal views on the
issue.

“Mudd, a native Washingtonian,
has been in broadcast news for
more than ten years. After gradu-
ation from Washington and Lee
University in 1950, he studied at
the University of North Carolina
and taught English in Rome, Ga.
He then joined WRNL radio in
Richmond, Va., moved to WTOP-
TV in 1956, and to the network in
1961.

“His soft Southern accent, along

SUMMER 1964

with an affable personality, has
attracted millions of viewers. Sev-
eral ladies, in fact, have written
CBS to express concern about his
health, since he has broadcast out-
doors in every weather imaginable.

“For Mudd, the end of the fili-
buster may mean a return to his
former $400-a-week average pay-
checks. But until the bill has been
voted upon later this month, he has
another few days of being a willing
part of one of the worst puns of
all time. ‘‘Friendly,” said a CBS
official recently, “is an alchemist.
After all, he turned Mudd into
gold.”

Mudd went on to report from
the floor of the 1964 Republican
National Convention in San Fran-
cisco, where even more. viewers
came to know and appreciate his
news-gathering skill.

Mudd joined CBS News, Wash-
ington, in July 1961 after serving
since 1956 as a member of the news
and Public Affairs Department of
WTOP, CBS afhliate in the na-
tion’s capital.

On Election Night in 196g,

 

 

Mudd analyzed the gubernatorial
and congressional results from the
South at CBS News Election Head-

quarters in New York City.

While a member of the WTOP
staff, Mudd accompanied Soviet
Premier Nikita Khrushchev during
his 1959 tour of the United States
and also attended the 1960 Repub-
lican and Democratic National
Conventions. He provided the com-
mentary on the televised Senate
Select Committee hearings on rack-
eteering in labor and management.

Before joining WTOP, Mudd
was News Director for station
WRNL, Richmond, Va.

In the fall and winter of 1952-53,
Mudd worked as a reseach assist-
ant for the Committee on Tax-
Exempt Foundations of the House
of Representatives. In June 1953,
he joined the staff of the Richmond
News Leader as a reporter and
four months later was appointed
the first full-time News Director
for WRNL, the radio station Op-
erated by that newspaper. Mudd is
married and the father of four
children.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

 

# EARLY IN 1964, considerable na-
tional attention came to be focused
on a relatively small (346 seats) rela-
tively obscure (a former Milwau-
kee movie house) repertory theater
known by the rather prosaic name
of the Fred Miller Theater.

The New York Times devoted a
lengthy article to the ups, downs,
and re-ups of the Fred Miller Thea-
ter, and in an article dealing with
repertory theater in America, Time
magazine cited the Fred Miller
Theater as one of the best of the
“reps.” A long piece in the Chris-
tian Science Monitor told of the
difficulties of bringing quality thea-
ter to a city that apparently didn’t
really want quality theater.

In every account of the heroics
of the Milwaukee players, the name
of John Alexander McQuiggan
jumped out, identifying him as the
prime mover behind the theater’s
current efforts, the young man re-
sponsible for much of its success
and the praise it has drawn.

Jack McQuiggan, °56, is at age
29 the producer of the Fred Mil-
ler ‘Theater, a job he has held
since the spring of 1963. He came
to the Fred Miller Theater in
1961 as a producer with the Asso-
ciation of Producing Artists of
which he was a founder. He became
general manager of the Miller
‘Theater in 1962.

Now, as producer, he selects the
eight plays which make up the Oc-
tober-April season, chooses the di-
rector of each play and the mem-
bers of the ten-member resident
company, and supervises the ad-
ministrative staff.

The current season was the Fred
Miller ‘Theater’s tenth, but only
its second under a policy that Mc-
Quiggan helped establish, a policy
that for a time seemed destined to
fail.

Through eight seasons, the thea-
ter had drawn good support for a
bill of fare based on the star sys-
tem, the kind of casting and play
selection that makes the ‘“Tonight”’

SUMMER 1964

 

 

JoHN A. McQuicGaAn, ’56

Alumnus Gives
Repertory Group
New Impetus

show’s announcer, Ed McMahon,
a smash in Paramus, N .J., or “Pass-
word's” Allen Ludden a wow in
Skowhegan, Me. The Fred Miller
management decided to inject qual-
ity into its drama by establishing
a repertory company of talent and
versatility.

The results were discouraging
during the first season of the new
plan. Only forty-nine per cent of
the seats were filled on the average,
and the resident director resigned
after disagreement with McQuig-
gan and others. ‘The Ford Founda-
tion, which had supported the ven-
ture to the tune of $50,000 for the
1962-63 season, pulled back a simi-
lar grant promised for 1963-64, part-
ly because, the Christian Science
Monitor suggested, foundation of-
ficials wanted to know if Milwau-
kee residents had enough “spunk
and interest to deserve the theater.”

McQuiggan, a veteran Trouba-
dour actor at Washington and Lee
and a big factor in two successful

student minstrels, became producer
in the spring of 1963, and fortune
seemed to change. Under his lea-
dership, a fund drive was launched,
ticket prices were cut for students,
a system of a new director for each
play was introduced, and_ things
generally began to hum. Attend-
ance filled up 71.5 per cent of the
seats on a given night, and the
plays McQuiggan produced were
hits. Said Time:

“Milwaukee’s Fred Miller Thea-
ter is battling odds and winning.
The odds are Milwaukee itself,
where the highest praise the drama
critics know how to give is to com-
pare the Miller’s actors with the
Green Bay Packers. But the Mil-
ler ‘Theater is winning because of
the extraordinary energy of its 20-
year-old producer, John Alexander
McQuigegan.” 7

Said the New York Times:

“After years of behind-the-scenes
problems that sometimes rivaled
what was happening on the arena
stage, the Fred Miller Theater has
found in the middle of its 10th sea-
son new stability, confidence, and,
astonishing even to theater officials,
genuine public response.

“More Milwaukeeans are attend-
ing the Miller, named for the late
brewery executive, than at any time
since its change two years ago to a
policy of presenting quality thea-
ber.

McQuiggan, who came to Wash-
ington and Lee from Xenia, Ohio,
and then went on to theatrical
study at the famed Neighborhood
Playhouse in New York, is hopeful
that the recent successes of the Fred
Miller Theater are only the begin-
ning. A $75,000 fund drive is vir-
tually complete, and a season ticket
sale of 4,000 for 1964-65 is antici-
pated, as compared with only 1,488
last year.

Says the young producer, “Mil-
waukee is not an easy town to put
something across. It is just begin-
ning to become aware of what we
have to offer.”

Dr. Leslie Lyle Campbell, ’87

@ DR. LESLIE LYLE CAMPBELL, '87, died on June 9
at his home on Washington Street in Lexington.
He was the oldest of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity alumni, for on September 17 he would
have celebrated his 101st birthday.

A distinguished scholar and teacher, Dr.
Campbell remained throughout his lifetime a
devoted friend to his Alma Mater, vitally inter-
ested in its growth and progress.

He was himself a contributor to that progress,
for he established a memorial scholarship in
honor of his late wife, Catherine Houston Camp-
bell, to be awarded to a student of English lit-
erature whose home was in Rockbridge County
or in the Valley of Virginia. His will provides
for the establishment of another memorial
scholarship through a bequest of $25,000.

Dr. Campbell also gave to the University the
Westminster Chimes and clock in the Lee Chap-
el, honoring the memory of a classmate and
friend, Livingston Waddell Houston, who
drowned in the North River in 1886. Installed in
the Chapel in 1948, the chimes can toll the pas-
sage of every quarter hour.

A native of Campo Bello in Powhatan Coun-
ty, Dr. Campbell received the M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees at Washington and Lee, ranking him
among the very few persons ever to receive a
Ph.D. degree from the University. He was a
charter member of the University’s Phi Beta

Kappa Chapter, and he served as an assistant
professor of mathematics in 1889-91.

He later headed the department of physics at
Westminster College in Missouri, and for twenty-
six years he held a similar post at Simmons Col-
lege in Massachusetts.

In 1903 he was awarded the Austin Fellow-
ship at Harvard University, and as a physics in-
structor there he conducted extensive research,
publishing his findings in the proceedings of
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He
also conducted research under Sir J. J. ‘Thomas
at Cambridge University in England and for the
United States Navy in World War I.

He held the rank of professor emeritus at
Simmons College, and until his death he still
considered himself an active research scientist,
studying the “Hall Effect” in metal crystals.

In failing health for many years, Dr. Camp-
bell was confined to his home, and despite a
great interest in the recent restoration of Lee
Chapel, he was never able to see the completed
project there.

President Cole and others of the University
staff were frequent callers at Dr. Campbell’s
home. He had no family and left no descendants.

For Washington and Lee, Dr. Campbell’s
death at 100 was the loss of another link from
the shortening chain that still connects today’s
University with its students of another century.

was not interested because of his age.

m THOMAS H. CARTER, 754 died on November 21, In sum, their words recounted his distin-

54

1963, in Martinsville, Virginia, where he was
born and grew up and where he returned after
college to teach and inspire.

Because of events many hundreds of miles
away the next day in Dallas, ‘Tom Carter’s pass-
ing was overshadowed by the assassination of
John F. Kennedy. His friends remarked on the
coincidence of the two deaths—the untimely end
of two relatively youthful men, each with
achievement behind them and promise before
them, and each in their special way a “‘profile in
courage.”

In June of 1964 Martinsville High School
published a magazine called Tribute, and the
focus of this tribute was Thomas H. Carter. The
purpose of the new magazine was twofold, its
preface stated: to honor the memory of ‘Tom
Carter as a writer, critic, and teacher, and to
serve as model for a future literary publication
that would be a continuing acknowledgment
of his special contributions to the literary influ-
ence upon Martinsville High School students.

Literary friends of ‘T'om Carter’s wrote mov-
ing tributes to the young man who had dis-
tinguished himself as an editor, an author, and
a scholar. ‘The roster of those who paid tribute
to him is impressive: James G. Leyburn, Mar-
shall Fishwick, Carol Johnson, Hugh Kenner,
Ashley Brown, Brainard Cheney, Robie Mc-
Cauley, James Boatwright, Caroline Gordon,
Andrew Foley, Andrew Lytle, and Louis Rubin.

guished career as an undergraduate at Washing-
ton and Lee, how he helped by great persona]
eficiency and _ persuasiveness to establish the
University’s literary magazine, Shenandoah, as
one of the best of all “little magazines’ orig-
inating on American campuses. Hugh Kenner
wrote, ““Tom Carter was, quite simply, a man
with a gift, amounting to genius, for editing lit-
erary magazines...’ The tributes told of his per-
sonal charm, his talent for persuasive letter writ-
ing, that brought original contributions to Shen-
andoah from writers of unquestioned stature
such as Wyndham Lewis, Ezra Pound, Wallace
Stevens, William Faulkner, e. e. cummings, and
others. ‘They told of his own quick mind, his
gift of poetic expression and critical insight.
They told of a young man beset with disabling
physical afflictions who, despite failing health,
still managed to bring knowledge and under-
standing to his students in Martinsville, chal-
lenge and inspiration to his many literary asso-
clates.

A recent Kenyon Review Fellow in Criticism,
‘Tom Carter was at the time of his death compil-
ing a collection of material pertaining to the
poet Ezra Pound, and in addition to his duties at
Martinsville High School, he taught also at the
Patrick Henry Branch of the University of Vir-
ginia in Martinsville.

His death at 32 left a vacuum in literary ed-
ucation and in American letters.
