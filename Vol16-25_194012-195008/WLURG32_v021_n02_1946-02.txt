A Report to the Alumni

(The President's Page)

GIFTS

The fall months enriched the University with some notable
bequests and contributions. Our distinguished alumnus, Mr.
William R. Perkins of Lynchburg and New York, left us by
will $150,000 to be added to the general endowment. Mrs.
Martha S. Menkemeller of Wheeling, mother of Charles A.
Menkemeller, who graduated here in 1915 and died in 1918,
left the bulk of her estate to Washington and Lee, the income
to be used for law scholarships. We have not yet received
this fund, but preliminary estimates indicate that it will ap-
proximate $200,000. At the year’s end, we received various
gifts totalling about $30,000, including one gift of $25,000 from
a corporation headed by a devoted alumnus.

We are constantly and gratefully mindful of the magnif-
icent achievement of the 1945 class-agent program; 1821 con-
tributors gave us more than $23,000.

THE STATUS

As we open the second semester of the current year, our
prospects are brighter than we expected them to be. We
should have about half a student body; and if anything like a
green light flashes across the path of aspiration for the
18-year old boys, we should have a full student body by Sep-
tember. Most of the faculty who have been on leave have al-
ready returned; all of them, save three or four who have re-
signed, should be on duty by the fall.

The School for Personnel Services, which had rented many
of our buildings, closed its work on January 5. We had no
relation to this cause other than that of landlord, but we fol-
lowed with interest the career of this important venture. More
than 25,000 officers and enlisted men were trained by this
agency.

Our veterans are coming back in gratifying numbers, and
these veterans so far are doing superb academic work. We
are admitting students three time a year, in September, in
February, and in June; but we encourage the veterans to
come at any time and to become auditors, without cost,
of any strategic courses which they may have had before
they went away, and thus “refresh themselves.” Like most of
the colleges, we are having trouble finding living quarters for
the married veterans, and probably half of these boys are
married. The Federal Housing Administration under the Lan-
ham act (one of our patrons, by the way) has allocated to

us twenty of these houses as a first installment. We hope to
get 100.

Since I am writing to alumni, may I offer a word of as-
surance—and it is valid for the next session of this report. We
have in America a condition without precedent, and all of us
are grateful for it; by virtue of the “G.I. Bill of Rights,” a
million boys and girls, roughly speaking, find themselves with
enough money to attend virtually any school in the country
which will admit them. We are getting rafts of applications
or at least of preliminary requests; but we are admitting only
those students who in our judgment can be served effective-
ly by us and can live happily and influentially under the tra-
ditions and conventions which we all cherish.

ATHLETICS

All activities, including athletics, are slowly getting under
Way again. For example, we have this year an intercollegiate
basketball schedule. The team, which Mr. Young is coaching
voluntarily and without conpensation, includes three boys who
are sons of our teachers; it has not won all of its games, but
we think we can safely challenge any team in the country that
contains a corresponding number of “faculty children.”

Those of us on the campus were astonished by the num-
ber of alumni who responded to the recent poll concerning
our policy as to intercollegiate football. We received approx-
imately 3000 replies; or, in other words, just about one third
of all living alumni took the trouble to give us the benefit
of their judgment. Of those replies, about three per cent
voted to abolish intercollegiate football; slightly more than
20 per cent voted to enter a small league that would admit
colleges on a purely amateur basis; and about 70 per cent
voted to maintain competition with our “traditional rivals”
and to extend aid to those students who demonstrate good
athletic ability and stand in need of such aid.

Guided largely by the opinion thus registered, we shall
resume football under the general provision of this plan. Mr.
Arthur Lewis, who was on our staff before the war, has been
engaged as coach, and Mr. Carl Wise, a King College grad-
uate who was formerly on the staff of the University of
Pennsylvania, is assistant coach of football and head coach
of basketball. To the department of physical education we
have added Mr. Ted Hesmer, formerly of the V.M.I. staff
and more recently with the Louisville Male High School,
who will also coach wrestling and track.

In connection with the football program, I may be per-
mitted to give to the alumni these confirmations of previous
promises: 1. We shall not sacrifice a well rounded course in
general physical education for any athletic sport; 2. We shall
not modify our entrance or general academic standards in be-
half of any boy, regardless of his athletic excellence; 3. We
shall not pay any student a salary to attend Washington and

Lee.
THE BICENTENNIAL

Foremost in my own thinking, and perhaps in the think-
ing of many who love your Alma Mater, is planning for the
Bicentennial of 1949. There are not many schools in the
United States, after all, that celebrate two hundred years of
service. The occasion is both an opportunity and an obliga-
tion of unique significance.

We are thinking of three phases. There will be, of course,
the program of observance for that memorable year. We want
to have “truly big doings” in our own right. We hope to in-
vite several national learned societies to meet during that
year on our campus.

We expect, too, to bring the records up to date. We hope
to have a new and accurate alumni register, and we shall
have by that time a history of the University. Our Dr. Olling-
er Crenshaw has been given leave of absence to write this
study. He will have the assisting counsel of four alumni

Army School Leaves Campus

By Public Relations Office, School for Personnel Services

FTER more than three years of outstanding training

achievements on the campus of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, the School for Personnel Services closed on 31 Jan-
uary 1946. The final classes were completed on 5 January
with graduation exercises held in Lee Chapel.

Few Army service schools have performed a greater ser-
vice or maintained higher standards than the one which was
established at Washington
and Lee on 1 December 1942.
And it is the belief of officials
of the School for Personnel
Services that few civilian in-
stitutions have cooperated
more successfully with the
war effort through the pro-
vision of instructional facil-
ities than has Washington
and Lee University. Signifi-
cant in any examination of
either the Army school or the
civilian University is the mag:
nificent relationship which ex-
isted between the Army per-
sonnel and the _ faculty
Washington and Lee—a rela-
tionship which contributed in
large measure to the success
of the military training pro-
gram.

Prior to its arrival on
Washington and Lee campus,
the School had been located
at Fort George C. Meade. Be-
cause of the inadequacy of
facilities for further expan-
sion, arrangements were made
to move the School to Wash-
ington and Lee. As the weeks
passed in the new location, an
ever-expanding program of
training came into existence,
with an increasing use of the
exceptionally fine facilities of
the University and the town
of Lexington, Virginia.

At the beginning of the
School’s occupation of the University’s buildings, Colonel
Leon T. David was Commandant. On 17 March 1943, Colonel
William H. Quarterman assumed command and guided the
School to the present time of its closing.

Following the de-activation of the School and the cessa-
tion of training at Washington and Lee, some divisions will
move to permanent Army posts where they can resume the
instruction which proved to be so well worth-while and
so necessary for the soldier, whether stationed overseas or
at home.

In order to determine what it was in the course of instruc-
tion that made the School for Personnel Services so impor-
tant to the war effort, it is necessary to examine briefly the
mission and scope of the different instructional divisions. It

Major General Joe Dalton awarding the “Meritorious Ser-
vice Unit Plaque” to Colonel William H. Quarterman.

becomes apparent at once that much favorable similarity can
be found between the Army School and civilian institutions
of higher learning. This is a comparison which few, if any,
other Army School could make, because of the nature of
their subjects.

Special Services Course

Mission: To provide training for duty in the field of Spec-
ial Services for officers of the
Army, Marines and Navy and
enlisted personnel of the
Army and Marines.

letic Field, in two large port-
able buildings erected by the
Army behind the Gymnas-
ium, and in_ classrooms
through the W&L Univer-

Scope: Program covers instruction in essential subjects
from WD courses in Information-Education, Personal Af-
fairs, and Special Services, selected on the basis of antici-
pated needs. The offices of the Transport Services Instruction-
al Division were set up in the basement of the W&L Li-
brary, and classes held in the rooms used by I & E, Personal
Affairs and Special Services.

Physical Training and Athletic Directors Course

Mission and Scope: To provide leadership training for
qualified officers and enlisted personnel for duty as instruc-
tors in physical training and athletics in Army Ground Forces
and Army Service Forces installations; to train administra-
tors, organizers, and instructors to carry on the emphasized
athletic and physical training phase of the redeployment pro-
gram. The Physical Training and Athletic Directors Course
used the VMI facilities, later moving to the W & L, Univer-
sity Gym and using the W & L athletic field and facilities.

On 11 April 1945, Major General Joe Dalton, Director of
Personnel, ASF, presented the School for Personnel Ser-
vices with the “Meritorious Service Unit Plaque.” This award
is one of the highest awards that can be made by the War
Department to a military school, and was awarded this school
for superior performance and outstanding devotion to duty
of all personnel. Again on 11 October 1945, a star was added
to the plaque in lieu of a second award. It is felt that the
fine cooperation and excellent facilities of the University con-
tributed greatly to the winning of these awards.

Many other advantages were offered the 25,000 students
who graduated from the Army School. A Post Exchange, sim-
ilar in many ways to the W &L, school store, was located in
the Dormitory building, as was the Military Department
Headquarters and the Post Engineers. An Army Book Store
was located in room 2 of Payne Hall, and a fully-equipped
dispensary was established in the basement of the Student
Union Building. Ex-Servicemen attending the Washington
and Lee University were given free medical and dental care
at this dispensary for a period not to exceed three months
from the date of their discharge.

The Kappa Alpha fraternity house was in part redec-
orated and used as an officers club, with an outdoor garden
and dance floor. The enlisted men held their dances in the
Student Union Building, which was redecorated as their
Cadre Club. They too enjoyed the use of an outdoor garden
and dance floor. There was also a lounge located on the first
floor of Reid hall. In addition to these buildings, most of
the fraternity buildings were used to house the soldiers,
Naval officers, marines, WACs, Marine Corps women, and
WAVEs who attended the school. The school’s Quartermas-
ter was located in a store building on Nelson Street in the
town of Lexington. The Finance Department paid the mili-
tary personnel in Newcomb Hall, where they had their office.
The School’s Visual Aids Department prepared visual and
training aids on the second floor of the University Gym,
while a film library and projection room were located in the
basement of Tucker.

Entertainment was provided for the students by the School
for Personnel Services in the form of dances, movies, sports,
soldier shows, etc., much of which was made possible through
many of the facilities provided by Washington and Lee. The
Lexingtonians for the most part divided their homes into
small housekeeping rooms or apartments and rented them
to the students and their families. This procedure helped the
housing shortage created by the influx of so many officers
and enlisted men, and at the same time provided a fine in-
come for the town. There were also historical tours of Lex-
ington for those who attended the school and were interested
in the historic buildings and the places of interest that are
so much a part of the tradition of Lexington and the history
of the South. Then there were the churches which always
welcomed the service men and women.

In addition, members of the Washington and Lee staff
served the Army school in many capacities. Dr. Francis P.
Gaines was guest speaker at many classes and events and
was in effect a member of the faculty of the I. & E. Division;
Mr. E. S. Mattingly, Treasurer of the University, was always
most closely associated with the Commandant, and assisted
greatly in all, matters concerning the two schools, proving
himself most sympathetic and invaluable in administrative
problems; Dr. Allen W. Moger functioned as Chief of the
Tests and Measurements Department, School for Personnel
Services; Mr. C. Harold Lauck aided the school through the
use of his printing service; Mr. Frank J. Gilliam was for a
while assigned to the School for Personnel Services with the
rank of Major and acted as Student Personnel Officer. All
Washington and Lee faculty members were helpful and co-
operative.

These were the elements and factors that made the
School for Personnel Services so successful. These were the
accomplishments of a group of Americans in uniform sup-
ported by Americans in civilian garb. The Washington and
Lee University will never be forgotten by those who at-
tended the School for Personnel Services, and Washington
and Lee University will never forget the Army School.

1945 Alumni Fund Breaks All Records

T IS A GREAT source of satisfaction to be able to pre-
ES a report in which the element of success is as much
in evidence as in this one on the 1945 Alumni Fund.

Once more the Fund hit new highs for both number

of contributors and the amount of money contributed.

-

Our objective was to raise $20,000. The result—$23,855
from 1821 alumni—is tangible evidence of the continued

and ever increasing loyalty of Washington and Lee men

everywhere. The total of your gifts represents the income

on an endowment of approximately $800,000. Expressed

in these terms, their value to the University is self-evi-
dent. The number of contributors increased 15% and the

amount contributed 34% over the previous year. In ever
larger numbers alumni are annually expressing their loy-
alty and affection for the University in the most tangible
way. The real strength of the Alumni Fund lies in this

fact. The size of your gift is relatively unimportant, but
the fact of your making this annual contribution is of tre-
mendous importance both to the success of the Alumni
Fund and to the spirit that is Washington and Lee.

Our goal for 1946 is $25,000 and within a few weeks
you will receive your annual letter from your Class
Agent. He is performing an unselfish service and your
prompt reply will be appreciated.

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

Football Returns to Washington and Lee

RT LEWIS, former Washington and Lee line coach, has
been appointed head football coach at the University and

will lead the Generals next fall in a seven-game schedule

against traditional rivals. Lewis’
appointment marks the return of
the University to intercollegiate
football after a lapse of four years
as necessitated by the war.

The University’s football pro-
gram, which was determined by a
polling of the alumni, will be con-
ducted on the basis of subsidiza-
tion as it had been before the war,
and it is expected that the sched-
ules will include the same colleges
that they used to. President Fran-
cis P. Gaines has emphasized that
the scholastic standards of the
University will not be lowered and
that there will be no dual standard
for athletes.

At the time of his appointment
on December 12, Lewis started
the revival of football from scratch
and with no prospects. “If we
have to,” he said, “we'll play
Cap’n Dick Smith at fullback. But
I hope some big, fast boys will
enroll by next fall.” By all media
of communication, Art has been
renewing acquaintances made in
the navy preflight school at St.
Mary’s where, as a_ lieutenant
commander, he was head of foot-
ball instruction, chief scout, and
assistant coach. It is likely though
that if there are any Blanchards
lying hidden to football fame and
fortune, Art would be grateful to
all alumni who will uncover them.

The handsome, six-foot-three, thirty-four-year-old Art
came to the University on January 1, 1942, as line coach and
served through the spring training period as line coach under
Riley Smith. Along with Smith, who is not returning to
football, Art was commissioned by the Navy in June, 1942,

 

Art Lewis, Head Football Coach

and was discharged in November, 1945, after duty at Pen-
sacola, New Orleans, and St. Mary’s.

He is a native of Carolton, Ohio, and began his football
career at Ohio University in 1932
where he was one of six all-Am-
erican tackles named in 1935. He
played in the 1935 East-West
game. Twice he was all-Ohio and
little all-American tackle.

In 1936 Lewis began a profes-
sional career with the New York
Giants. Then after coaching the
line at Ohio Wesleyan University
in 1937, he was playing head
coach of the Cleveland Rams in
1938 when they won seven of their
eleven games. In 1939 he played
and coached the Bams’ line and
in the next two years he was their
line coach and chief scout.

At St. Mary’s he served under
Head Coach Jim Lawson of Stam-
ford and worked with Bernie
Masterson of Nebraska, Gormer
Jones of Ohio State, and George
Sauer of New Hampshire. News-
paper rumor had it that Notre
Dame Coach Frank Leahy of-
fered him an assistant’s post at
South Bend.

Art will not cross his seven
bridges until he comes to them
next fall, but he is diligently at
work along their approaches.

Carl Wise, King College foot-
ball and basketball player for three
years, was appointed on February
l as Lewis’s assistant and as head
basketball coach. Last year Wise
was an assistant football coach
and scout at the University of Pennsylvania. Before his dis-
charge from the Navy in the fall, he coached two Navy teams,
and previous to that he coached football and basketball at
the Newland, North Carolina, and Gate City and Covington,
Virginia, high schools.

the capacity of Assistant Regional Officer of the U. S. Mari-
time Commission and War Shipping Administration for the
Midwestern district. He entered the U. S. Maritime Service
as an Apprentice Seaman and after “boot” training at Sheeps-
head Bay, New York, was assigned to administrative duty as
Yeoman to the Public Relations Officer of that station. In
September, 1944, he was called to Washington, elevated to
the rank of Warrant Officer and designated as Assistant
Regional Public Relations Officer in Chicago. However, this
tour of duty was short-lived for, in January, 1945, he took
over the post of Public Relations Officer at the Catalina
Island, U. S. Maritime Service Training Station, where his
principal concern was the coast-to-coast USMS-CBS pro-
eram, We Deliver the Goods, which originated at Avalon for
well over a year. In addition he had charge of the station’s
newspaper and photo laboratory. In May came the rank of
Ensign and in August, Faulkner was returned to Chicago
to serve in his present capacity. He has been married for nine
years and his wife, the former Georgia Orwig, is well known
in Pittsburgh and Chicago musical circles.

Chinese General Praises Alumnus

The following translation of a letter, received by the
mother of Dan Pinck, ’46, from a Chinese General, was re-
cently published in The Record, Bethesda, Maryland.

20th July 1945
Dear Madam:

At the beginning of our resistance against the Japanese
aggression, we have had America’s gracious help, and now we
are fighting arm in arm for the same aim of developing the
everlasting peace of mankind. We appreciate that Americans
are true and kind towards us.

Recently your son Dan has been sent to China and is now
working in my war area. | have made acquaintance of him
and also acknowledge that he is young and smart and has
more dignity than any American I have met. There is no
limit in his future.

In our conversations we know you sympathize with our
country. At the departure of your son you have well informed
him to help China and to make friends with Chinese. Thus we
know this is the result of your teaching to your son, as to
make him know China thoroughly.

Your son has become my good friend and I made him a
Major of mine. I hope American and Chinese could join
their hands as tightly as we have. May I express my hearty
admiration to you.

Dan is healthy and strong, we'll do what we can to help
him with his work and have good cooperation.

My letter will travel a long distance before reaching you
and I end my letter with best regards to your health.

proper time, we shall announce a campaign for funds. The
exact amount and the time of the campaign have not been

“pressure” movement; we shall not have solicitation at
“whoop-em-up” meetings, and we shall not have the long-
time embarrassing pledge cards. Quietly we shall invite those
who believe in our ideals and our purposes to give us help,

We shall seek to serve three ends; we want to increase
the general endowment, partly to offset the swift decline in
earning power of the funds we already have; when I joined
the staff in 1930, our endowment earned six per cent but last
year it earned less than four per cent. We shall want to in-
crease greatly the number of scholarships, so that we may
welcome those admirable boys who have every quality for
great careers except the mony to pay our fees. We shall
plan to add several buildings to make complete the adequacy
of our facilities. We shall be glad to have your comment
concerning any phase of the plans; and we shall particularly
be grateful if every alumnus who reads these words will be-
gin now to think of potential donors—in his community or
among his business associates—who may at the proper time
be interested in our hopes.
