On Valentine’s eve, when I write these notes, we seem
to be midway between two high spots of this memorable
year, December 31 when the first phase of our Bicenten-
nial Campaign closed and April when the culminating
cycle of Bicentennial celebrations begins. Of many topics
I should fervently wish to present, I choose only two or
three.

ee ee

The dominant emotion in my heart is gratitude, a
humble gratitude with rich corollaries of inspiration and
dedication, for all who made possible the achievement
of that first phase of the Bicentennial Campaign. Dr.
Desha’s report, printed elsewhere in this issue, gives
interesting details of the response from donors which
enabled us to claim the generous participating sum pro-
posed by the General Education Board.

* * kK KX *

My thanks, stirring within my heart as representative
of a great institution and as an individual who loves it
devotedly, are everlasting to all who made possible that
result—to the contributors, nearly four thousand of
them, to the committees who assumed the burden in a
hundred communities, to all friends whe spoke an in-
fluential word in our behalf, to the class-agents who gave
their energies of the past year to emphasizing the oppor-
tunity.

kk KOK OX

Speaking of class-agents reminds me of this fact; I
hope all alumni understand the program for the cur-
rent year. The Bicentennial goal has not, of course,
been fully attained. The class-agent plan will be re-
sumed but with this important provision, that alumni
who wish to make further or new contribution to the
permanent assets (the Bicentennial Fund) may do so
through the class-agent plan. May many alumni add to
the substantial donations of last year!

bi

 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
    

It would be easy and it would be engaging for m
to write this whole sketch upon the service of thos
permanent funds. For example, the generosity of oy
friends has guaranteed for us that approximately 1@
fine boys can attend the University every year from t
time forever without paying tuition fees; this happy cor
sequence follows the building up of scholarship funds, a
this consequence is the first factor we considered in rais
ing tuition, an inevitable step in the period of sky-rocke
ing cost.

x * kK * *

But the enlargement of permanent funds means mor¢
I suspect, than any one of us can now understand. T
security of the independent institution of higher learr
ing now promises to be one of our major safeguards &
freedom. In a society that seems to move with terribl
constancy in the direction of collectivism, with agencié
and institutions and organizations clamoring for goverr
mental sustaining and thereby surrendering at least 1
posse control to government authorities, the independen
institution for training leadership, devoted to public we
fare but free of political domination, may prove one ¢
the final citadels of the liberty Americans must alwa
cherish. The point would stand vast elaboration heré
but I think its pertinence is self-evident to all thoughtf
friends of higher education.

* kK Kk kK *

Returning to the local program, I repeat our wa
invitation to all alumni to return for the great alumn
reunion, June 16-18. Mr. Young has delighted me b
telling me that paid reservations have come in alread
for about 400 people. This occasion promises to bring te
the campus the greatest group of alumni that ever as:
sembled in Lexington. With every sincerity of the heart
we plead that all alumni who can possibly arrange th
trip should be with us at that time.

Reunion in Lexington

You will see more of your friends than ever before

Circle these dates on your calendar: June 16, 17 and 18.

They are the dates of the National Bicentennial Celebra-
tion and Alumni Reunion. They are the days when Wash-
ington and Lee will welcome more of her returning sons
than have ever gathered on the campus at one time in the
200-year history of the institution.

A program you will enjoy is being arranged with the col-
laboration of an Alumni Advisory Committee. But consider-
ably more important than any program is the dead certainty
that, no matter what class you belong to, you will see more of
your classmates here at that time than you ever have since you
were a student or may ever see again. An advance survey
indicates that at least a thousand alumni are already plan-
ning to attend; this is the year when every class can hold a re-
union, and the program—at the demand of the Advisory Com-
mittee—is leaving you plenty of opportunity to foregather
with your classmates and friends.

Now for the details:

Registration will be held in a big tent that is going to be
set up in front of Doremus Gymnasium. There you will sign
in, and there the committee will assign you to your quarters,
and tell you where you can get in touch with your classmates.
Every class will have a headquarters somewhere on the cam-
pus.

Thursday night at 8 o’clock there will be an informal get-
together for those who have arrived; music will be provided,
registration will continue, and you can look over the crowd
and see who’s here. This is when your wife is bound to run
across somebody she knew at Sweet Briar, St. Agatha’s, or
Stonewall Jackson High School.

Registration will start again at 7 a.m. Friday morning and
will continue until 10.

There will be a religious service in. Lee Chapel at 10:30
a.m.—thanksgiving for the work that Washington and Lee
has been permitted to do for two centuries, prayer that she
may keep true to her ideals in the Third Century.

At 11 a.m. there will be a general alumni meeting in the
Gymnasium to get through the business of the Alumni As-
sociation, elect officers, and plan the program for the coming
year. Business will be over at 12 noon and the fun begins.

Then we will inaugurate something that is new to W.
and L. reunions—a “parade” (W. and L.—not V.M.I.—style)
past a “reviewing stand” to the Memorial Gateway. Each
class, marshalled by its chairman, will march in a body, and
you'll have a chance to see who got here fustest with the
mostest.

At the gateway there will be an old-fashioned barbecue
pit. Your class will assemble around its banner, and you will
eat in the shade of the trees on the lower campus. Alumni
and wives will be the guests of the University at this meal,
and it will be the only one where everybody will eat together.
Phat’s because we're going to have so many people back
that there’s no one eating place in Lexington that will accom-
modate all of them.

Your other meals, incidentally, will be taken with your
Classmates and their wives. We can’t tell you which group
will eat where until the advance registration is over, and we
Set an idea of just how many there will be in each group.

|

Finals, 1948

 

Some groups will eat in the dining hall, some in several fra-
ternity houses that will be kept open, and others in various
Lexington eating places. That’s the way the alumni poll in-
dicated it should be.

At 5 that afternoon there will be a tea at the home of
President and Mrs. Gaines, to which all returning alumni
and their wives are invited.

Then, at 9 p.m. there will be a dance at the gymnasium.
This will be the Alumni Ball, but it will not be just a side-
show of the Final Dance Set. Finals and commencement will
be over. The entire reason for having the Reunion late this
year is because if school were still in session we wouldn't
have room in Lexington for everyone who is planning to
come. This Alumni Ball will be informal, so you don’t have
to bother about packing your tux. Tell your wife she won't
need an evening dress, but she will probably want an after-
noon formal for that tea at the President’s home.

The dance will go on until 1 a.m., but you can sleep late
Saturday morning.

The Convocation which marks the National Celebration of
Washington and Lee’s 200th anniversary starts at 11 o’clock
sharp Saturday. There will be a speaker of national promi-
nence (maybe The President), the 200th session of Washing-
ton and Lee will officially close, and the University will be
embarked on its Third Century.

After that we’re leaving you on your own. You can get to-
gether with your fraternity brothers, or the Kentucky Club
you used to belong to can stage its first get-together in “too
many years.” Here’s a chance for the Sigmas to join forces,
or the ex-editors of The Ring-tum Phi, or the Southern Con-
ference championship teams, or the old-timers from the AIl-
bert Sidney and Harry Lee boat clubs, or the law alumni,
or the Gauley Bridge Hunt Club.

That afternoon those of you who wish to can taper off with
a quiet expedition to Goshen Pass or Cave Mountain Lake,

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

 

or play golf, or drop by to settle that unpaid bill with your
old landlady, or run down to Natural Bridge, or climb House
Mountain, if you think you're still young. Our part of the
show is definitely over, but we'd like to have you stay around
and frolic freely.

Now, if you’ll glance back over that schedule, you'll notice
that we've left you plenty of time to develop your own recrea-
tion, to visit friends in the vicinity or to chat with your old
friends—Thursday evening, from two to five and from six
to nine Friday, and after the convocation on Saturday. If the
ladies want to stage a bridge tournament, we'll provide the
tables in the Student Union, if somebody wants to organize
a ball game between classes, Cap’n Dick Smith will scare up
some equipment, and all of Wilson Field and the Alumni
Intramural Field are at your disposal. You may want to use
the rowing shells for a crew race on the James.

Here’s some important information about accommoda-
tions:

Information about accommodations was sent out January
20 with reply cards and envelopes (if you didn’t get one, write
Cy Young immediately), and reservations will be made in
order of the receipt of these cards.

This is the general plan of accommodations:

Older alumni and their wives will be housed in Lexington
and Natural Bridge hotels, which have already been reserved
by the University. No hotels are booking accommodations di-
rect, since we have contracted for all the rooms available dur-
ing the three-day reunion.

The younger alumni will be accommodated in the re-
modelled dormitories (if you’re thinking of Lees Dorm as
it looked when you bade it goodbye in 1937, you’re in for a
pleasant surprise) and in some of the fraternity houses.

The best quarters will be reserved for those alumni who
are bringing their wives, but the accommodations are being
arranged so that you will room and eat in the same building
with the fellows you were in school with. There is a place on
the card for you to indicate your class preference in case
you are one of those whose stay here was interrupted by a
war, or if for some other reasons you are better acquainted
with the members of another class.

A number of the fraternities are being kept open to pro-
vide meals, and you can eat with your classmates either there
or at some other eating place in Lexington. House mothers
will remain in town to welcome you, and you will be invited
to use the lounge and facilities (ice cubes and mint included)
of the house to which you are assigned.

If you want to assure yourself of the best possible ac-

    
   
  
   
   
   
   
  
   
   
  
  
   
   
    
  
  
   
  
   
  

commodations, be sure to get your card in by the deadline
March 15. And don’t forget to enclose the reservation fee ¢
$5 per person. This will be returned to you May 15 if some
thing occurs before that time to keep you from coming. Other
wise, the fee will go toward paying for your room.

The rates at the hotel will be the ones they usually charg
for the room you occupy. Rates in the dormitories and fr;
ternities will be slightly lower. The only other charges yo
will have to pay will be the cost of your meals.

The University is appropriating a sum to cover the bar
becue, the dance and all the other expenses in connection wi
your entertainment.

The cost of keeping the dormitory and fraternity house
open for an extra week will be pro-rated, and a flat per pe
son charge will be made for your stay.

If you wait until after March 15 to send in your reservg

If you have been in the habit of staying at the home o
friends in Lexington or near-by, make your own arrange

arrange for this, since we know that accommodations will
at a premium, and you will do better to allow yourself tin
to book a room through the Reunion Committee in cas
friends can’t accommodate you.

Bicentennial Academic Convocation

The academic exercises which mark the Bicentennial of
Washington and Lee University will be held in Lee Chapel
on Washington-Cincinnati Day—April 12—before a gather-
ing of prominent American educators.

President Harold W. Dodds of Princeton University, the
institution from which Washington and Lee inherited its phil-
osophy of independence and individualism and the core of
its liberal arts curriculum, will make the principal address.

His audience will be the presidents of the colleges in the
Southern University Conference, presidents and faculty rep-
resentatives of other institutions of higher learning and foun-

[ 6 ]

  
   
   
    
    

dations, eminent American scholars, and representatives 0
the students and alumni of Washington and Lee.

About two hundred other institutions will send delegate
to the celebration. The invitations are being limited to thos
colleges with a historical organization, geographical or fune
tional relation to Washington and Lee.

“We profoundly regret that the limited capacity of Le
Chapel—and a ceremony of this importance could not 2
held elsewhere—does not permit us to invite delegates fron
many other institutions for which we have high respect.” Df
Gaines said.

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

 

He explained that
the academic ceremo-
nies will not be open
to the public, for that
reason and also be-
cause of the lack of ac-
commodations in Lex-
ington for out-of-town
guests while the stu-
dent bodies of W. and
L. and V.M.I. are in
residence.

“We feel that these
ceremonies, while they
have the greatest sig-
nificance to us as one
of the oldest academic
groups in the nation,
will not be of sufficient
interest to alumni to
warrant a trip to Lex-
ington just two
months before the Na-
tional Celebration and
Bicentennial Reunion
in their honor, which
will draw the largest crowd ever to gather on the campus.”

The committee of National Sponsors of the Bicentennial,
the board of trustees and the faculty of the University will be
present. The alumni will be represented by the president and
hoard of trustees of Alumni, Incorporated, and the students
by the president of the Student Body and a delegation of un-
dergraduates. The remaining students and others interested
may hear the address and exercises by public address system.

After the academic procession into the Chapel, the cere-
monies will begin with a recognition of the delegates of other
institutions. Then honorary degrees will be awarded to men
of letters who have attained prominence in the educational
and literary life of America.

President Dodds is expected to discuss liberal education
in America and the future of the liberal arts college.

Following the ceremonies, the delegates will gather for
luncheon at the Natural Bridge Hotel, at which time several
representatives of other groups will make short speeches of
congratulations.

During the afternoon, delegates and their wives will be
the guests of President and Mrs. Gaines at a tea at the Presi-
dent’s home.

The day’s program will conclude with a complimentary
tull-dress review by the cadets of Virginia Military Institute.

The date of the celebration—April 12—is that of the an-
nual Washington-Cincinnati Convocation which commemo-
rates George Washington’s gift of endowment and the gift
of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati which enabled Au-
gusta Academy to become Washington College.

_ On the following two days, the Southern University Con-
ference will honor Washington and Lee by holding its annual
conference in Lexington as the guest of the University.

Law School Centennial
Celebration

The Centennial of
the Washington and
Lee University
School of Law will
be observed May 10
and 11, when the
Honorable John W.
Davis will inaugurate
the John Randolph
Tucker Memorial
Lectures in Law. The
second lecture will be
delivered at a Convo-
cation on May l1I,
commemorating the
founding of the Law

School in 1849.
Founded by Judge
John White Brock-

enbrough in 1866 as
the Lexington Law
School, this was af-
filiated with Wash-
ington College at
General Lee’s invita-
tion in 1866 and in 1870 became one of the regular Schools of
the institution.

The Tucker Memorial Lectures—which will be delivered
annually and published by the University—-commemorate the
distinguished contribution to legal education of Dean John
Randolph Tucker.

Mr. Davis will deliver two lectures on the subject: John
Randolph Tucker—The Man and His Work. The first lecture
will deal with Mr. Tucker’s life and personality, the second
with his principles of constitutional law as viewed in the
light of the present day situation.

Mr. Davis received his academic degree from Washington
and Lee in 1892 and his law degree in 1895, taught in the
School of Law in 1896 and 1897, and was awarded an honor-
ary LL.D. degree by the University in 1915. A former So-
licitor General of the United States, and a leading member
of the Bar of the Supreme Court, Mr. Davis is an Honorary
Bencher of the Middle Temple (England) and in 1922 was
president of the American Bar Association. In 1924, he was
Democratic nominee for President of the United States, and
was Ambassador to Great Britain from 1918 to 1921.

Mr. Davis is general chairman of the University’s Bicen-
tennial Celebration, and is a member of the University Board
of Trustees.

Dean Clayton E. Williams of the School of Law has an-
nounced that all alumni of Washington and Lee are cordial-
ly invited to the lectures and Convocation. Plans are being
made to invite the faculties of other law schools in Virginia
and neighboring states, and the members of the Virginia
State Bar Association.

ODK ‘Taps’ Alumni

In the annual “tapping” exercises of Omicron Delta Kap-
id in the Washington and Lee Gymnasium on Decem-
her 10, 21 undergraduates and 18 honorary memberships were

More Scholarships Balance
Tuition Increase

The Washington and Lee board of trustees has voted an
increase of $100 in tuition fees, effective at the beginning of
the 201st session next September.

Announcement that tuition would be raised to an average
$450 a year was made by President Francis P. Gaines in his
annual “State of the University” address delivered at Found-
er’s Day exercises January 19. Dr. Gaines said the raise was
necessary “to meet greatly increased costs of operation.”

Dr. Gaines told the assembled student body and faculty
that “a fundamental problem of every institution today is
the increase in basic operational expenses. Our auditor’s re-
port shows that the cost of coal has more than doubled since
1940-41, costs of building supplies and labor for upkeep and
maintenance have tripled, wages have more than doubled,
scientific equipment costs have gone up 50 to 150 per cent, and
we expect 85 teachers in the next term as compared with
69 before the war.”

In addition to rising operational costs, President Gaines
cited the University’s obligation to raise faculty salaries to
meet universally increased living expenses. Figures com-
piled by the University’s department of accounting and sta-
tistics reveal that instructional cost per student, based en-
tirely on teacher salaries, has risen from $212 in the 1940-41
session to $293 this year.

In the academic divisions the tuition, computed on the
basis of semester hours work carried by the student, will
average $180 a semester. Law school tuition will be a fixed
$180 a semester. The University Fee, allotted for causes for
which the University merely serves as agent, such as medical,
hospital, library, recreation and similar elements, will be raised
from $25 to $45 a semester.

While the Washington and Lee tuition is generally higher
than other southern institutions, the present $350 tuition is
far out of line with comparable colleges and universities over
the country. For example, Swarthmore, Haverford, Dart-
mouth, Williams, Colgate and Oberlin all have appreciably
higher tuition rates than Washington and Lee.

Counter-balancing the possible adverse effect imposed by
the tuition raise upon some students and prospective stu-
dents is a proportionate increase in the number of new scholar-

Bicentennial Progress Report

The Bicentennial Office is happy to report excellent pro-
gress for 1948. During that year the total cash fund increased
$737,000 to a total of $1,643,000; the number of alumni sub-
scribers grew from 500 to 3225; and alumni contributions
showed a gain of $308,000. Thanks to the heavy flow of sub-
scriptions late in December we were able to claim, and have
banked, the last of the $300,000 conditionally pledged by the
General Education Board.

The figures in the tables which follow are based on cash
receipts from the beginning of the campaign through Decem-
ber 31, 1948. The tables are self explanatory and further com-
ment seems unnecessary.

After careful consideration, we decided against our original
plan of publishing the names of contributors at this time, as
was done a year ago. To do so would swell this issue of the

The Race with the G. E. B.

The Story of the Last Few Days of 1948

If you’re an average alumnus, the chances are you sat
down to your desk one late day in December, opened the
drawer that was bulging with the publications Washington
and Lee has been sending you for two years, looked sadly at
a checkbook that had more stubs in it than blanks, cut short
wishful thinking about how you wanted to give to the Bicen-
tennial, settled for whatever you could give that day, and put
it in the mail before December 31 so the General Education
Board would add 25 per cent to it.

That’s what more than a thousand average alumni did
during December, and so we say:

“Thank God for the average alumnus!”

The spate of letters that started early in December reached
its crest the week after Christmas, when gifts came in from
all over, from chairmen, from committeemen, from class
agents and from individuals—in business reply envelopes, by
regular mail and special delivery, by telegraph and by hand.
No checks came in by telephone, but one chairman did phone
from west of the Mississippi to say that he had been sick and
unable to mail in some gifts. He asked Cy Young to deposit
cash to cover them so Washington and Lee would get the
Rockefeller money.

Everybody in Washington College got in on the act, as
alumni, parents and friends addressed letters to whoever
popped into their minds. Dr. Gaines got scores of checks, as
did Treasurer Earl Mattingly and Alumni Secretary Cy
Young. Some were addressed to Deans Gilliam and Leyburn,
and some to the Registrar. Even the Editor of the Bicenten-
nial Alumni Directory got a few.

On December Ist, the Bicentennial was $192,000 short of
the amount needed to claim every dollar of the GEB’s pro-
visional offer, and this had to be raised by the end of the
month. When the students left for the holidays, we were
$98,000 short, and when the Bicentennial staff went home on
Christmas Eve, we were still $23,000 from the goal. At the
close of business on Wednesday, December 29, we thought we
would go over, and when the Post Office called Thursday
morning to say there were more letters than the P.O. box
would hold, we knew it.

The G.E.B.’s final check was deposited, and when the
dust had cleared and the 1948 receipts were added up, the
grand total came to $1,642,937.85, including the $300,000 from
the G.E.B.—every cent of it. We actually made it with a
margin of some $50,000 to spare.

It was mid-January before all the gifts received in De-
cember—1747 of them—were totalled and put through the
complicated accounting system that insures each gift will be
credited to the donor’s class, and earmarked for the particu-
lar fund for which he designated it. It was even later than

that before President Gaines—who insisted on seeing and

acknowledging every contribution—waded through the pile
of gift records on his desk.

So, if your contribution was not receipted immediately,
blame the delay on dimensions of a job that overwhelmed
our officials and staff. More gifts were received in December
than in the entire preceding eight-month period.

Perhaps the most influential appeals, to judge from the
letters and notes which accompanied many of the checks,
were the series of letters written early in December by Chris-

[12]

  
  
 
    
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
   
   
  
   
   
    
    
  
  
   
 
   
   
   
   
  

topher T. Chenery, 09, executive chairman of the Bicente
nial, and the letters which many Class Agents wrote to th
classmates during the fall. .

Mr. Chenery’s letters stated that only 17 per cent of
alumni had contributed. Within three weeks after the lette
had been received, the number of alumni contributors
almost doubled. Coincidental with the flood of corresponde
here in Lexington there was a backwash of replies and che
in Mr. Chenery’s office in New York that demanded all
resourcefulness of his secretary. (She even got one letter ¢
dressed to Christopher Wrenn.)

The current total of alumni contributors (the number
gifts is larger, because many of these alumni have given se
eral times) is 3190—the largest group, both numerically a
percentagewise, ever to contribute at one time to Washin
ton and Lee.

 

W. and L. Montgomerys of Montgomery, West Virginiz

Beginning with Laurence Montgomery, who. enter
Washington and Lee in 1923, a member of this family h
been in attendance here consecutively, with the exception
the war period, for 26 years. The mothers of the Vickers a
Carsons were Montgomerys, all of them from Montgomer
West Virginia. They are: Laurence Montgomery, ’23-2
LL.B.; Arnold Wickers, ’26-’31, LL.B.; Howard Carson, ’2
33, B.A., LL.B.; Carl Vickers, ’28-’34, B.A., LL.B.; A. @
Vickers, ’33-’37, B.S.; Laurence Carson, ’36-’40, B.S.; Willi
Carson, °39-’43, B.S.; Earl Vickers, °41-’43, °46-’49, LL.B
and George Vickers, ’46-'47. |

 

Dr. Charles W. Turner of the Washington and Lee histo
department has just published his tenth in the series of artich
on the history of Virginia railroads. These articles, coverif
phases of railroad history, have been published in vario
historical publications.

The latest article, “Virginia Railroads’ Service to Farr
ers 1829 to 1860,” appeared in the fall issue of Agricultur
History Magazine, publication of the history section of
U.S. Department of Agriculture. It compares the servi
rendered farmers by the railroads with other means of tram
portation, dealing specifically with 17 railroad lines. The i
crease in land values and population and the part the rz
roads played in this is dealt with.

 

An opportunity has come to Washington and Lee to pu
chase for the museum of the biology department a mounte
specimen of the extinct passenger pigeon. These nati
American birds, depicted by Audubon in his ornithologi¢
studies have been extinct along with the Carolina Paroque
since the early part of this century. Both birds were nati
to Virginia in the early days.

At the present time no specimens are available exce
as a private collection of birds becomes broken up for sal
Another specimen may not be available for many years af
then only at a higher price than the present price of $200.
It is hoped that some alumnus of Washington and Lee,
group of alumni, or friend of the University who reads th
note may desire to purchase this passenger pigeon for
University.

Tuition Increase

(Continued from page 9)

ships available to young men possessing every qualificatie
for satisfactory college work and future usefulness excep
financial resources.

Through the generosity of donors to the Bicentenni
Fund, the University was able to announce almost simul
taneously with the tuition increase that new “Third Centu
Scholarships” worth more than $50,000 to recipients are be
ing offered to young men desiring to enroll as freshmen fe
the 201st session.

When added to the present program of grants-in-aid noy
available through permanently endowed and departmen
scholarships, more than 100 men may attend Washingto
and Lee with financial assistance. The 30 new scholarship
already created in the Bicentennial program range in valu
from a top of $3,500 down to $900 each. Other scholarship
may possibly be added before the beginning of the Septembe
term.

Applications are now being received by the committee 0
scholarships. Candidates will be required to take the aptitud
test of the College Entrance Examination Board.

An announcement of the new scholarships distributed t
preparatory and high schools says aid will be awarded “o
the basis of academic record, character, need, and promis
of future usefulness.”

Dean Frank J. Gilliam, chairman of the faculty committe
on scholarships, said that “In awarding these scholarships th
committee in charge will make every effort to select thos
candidates who have the greatest promise for future useful
ness. The distribution of awards will be on as wide a geé
graphical basis as possible, consistent with the stipulations ¢
donors.”

Dean Gilliam added that alumni throughout the natio
can support the scholarship program by encouraging promis
ing young men who meet the qualifications to apply direct
ly to the scholarship committee.

George Barclay, New Football Coach

By Bill Bien

George Barclay eased his substantial frame back in the
revolving chair and flexed his fingers; he’d just finished shak-
ing the hands of assorted football players, students, faculty
members, and well-wishers and his hand was getting tired.
Outside, two workmen were busy tacking a new sign on
the door: “George Barclay—Football Head Coach.’

Washington and Lee’s new coach succeeds Art (Pappy)
Lewis, who resigned his position as head coach in December
to follow former VMI head coach Arthur (Slick) Morton to
Mississippi State. Lewis gave up his W. and L. contract,
which had two more years to run, for a line-coaching job.

It’s going to be a tough job molding a football team out
of what’s left of last year’s material and Barclay knows it.

fut, he told his new charges at a football banquet early
in February, “The first thing you have to do is to hit the
hooks hard this semester.’”’ Washington and Lee is no athletic
club, he realizes, and he knows the value of football men who
are also good students.

Tipping the scales at 200 pounds, Barclay has edged past
the 180-pound playing weight he carried at North Carolina
in 1934 when he made all-American guard under Carl Snave-
ly. Graduated in 1935, after three varsity seasons at UNC,
Barclay played four games with the Brooklyn Dodgers pro-
fessional football team, but retired with a smashed knee.

In 1936 he served as line coach at V.M.I. under Bill Raf-
tery, and moved on to North Carolina as freshman football
coach in 1937. Barclay left Carolina in 1940 for the job of
football line coach and basketball head coach at Oberlin, and
then went into the service.

During his three years in the Navy, the former all-Ameri-
can coached football at Georgia Preflight and Jacksonville
Naval Air Station.

Following the war, Barclay moved to Dartmouth for one
season as line coach, and then joined Jim Tatum at the Uni-
versity of Maryland as line coach. Barclay and Tatum had
played together for three seasons at Carolina, and the new
W. and L. grid pilot was Tatum’s first choice when he was
awarded the Maryland coaching position.

Barclay has a Bachelor of Arts Degree from North Caro-
lina and has completed work for his master’s degree except
for a thesis.

“But I doubt if I’ll get much time to finish it next year,”
Says Barclay with a wry smile.

The W. and L. mentor has a. wife and two daughters who
are still living in College Park, Maryland. Reason: They have
no place to drop their gear in Lexington.

“I'm still looking for a place to live all right,” Barclay said.
“Sure would like to meet an interested alumnus with a place
for rent in Lexington.”

“But, speaking of alumni,” Barclay continued more seri-
ously, “IT wish you’d put in your story that whenever any
Washington and Lee alumni are in town, I’d like very much
to meet them. After all, the alumni are the ones who can in-

uence good students who can also play football to come to
School here.”

Barclay is a young man with plans.

One of his plans is a four-day practice week next fall,
and he warned the W. and L. gridmen recently: “You can
make up your minds that some of you are not going to be

 

eZ

Barclay and Jerry Jack, 275 Pound Guard

 

playing the same positions next fall. We’re going to be very
weak through the line and some of you backfield men will be
learning tackle plays before September.”

“This pass-happy technique is out,” says Barclay flatly.
Next fall, if Washington and Lee is nothing else, it will be
a team that knows its fundamentals. With a split-T forma-
tion that I’m planning to use, we'll have to do a lot of running;
that means plenty of blocking.

So it looks as if the “aerial circus” has gone out of busi-
ness. “It’s out—this passing where half the time you catch
the ball and the other half your opponent gets it.”

The tackle slot is Barclay’s chief pre-season worry. Two
lettermen—Bob Smith and Don Fergusson—are doubtful
starters because of crippling injuries, and another regular,
John Tulloh, has left Washington and Lee because of scholas-
tic difficulties.

But, meanwhile, spring practice will get underway about
the end of February—weather permitting—and will run for
five weeks. Then, says Barclay, he will have a better idea of
just what he has in the way of material.

Regular practice sessions will open next September 1, no
earlier because of conference regulations, which forbid open-
ing workouts before that date. If, and that’s a big one, all
the players make grades all right this spring, Barclay will
probably have 45 men on his varsity roster to open the season.

“The first four games next fall are the ones that worry
me,” he states. “If we can get by West Virginia, Georgia
Tech, and those big outfits without too many injuries, we
should roll along in good style.”

No matter what happens next fall, you get the impression
when talking with George Barclay, that he has confidence in
himself, and that he’ll turn out a fighting ball club—win,
lose, or draw.

A Resume of Winter Sports

By Bill Bien

With towering Bob Spessard at the helm, Washington
and Lee’s basketball squad is beginning to sizzle again this
winter in a way reminiscent of old-time Blue Comet quintets.

As usual there is little tall timber around Doremus Gym-
nasium, but the Generals are still being mentioned prominent-
ly for a playoff spot in the annual Southern Conference
Tournament at Durham, North Carolina.

GI Freshman Jay Handlan has grabbed many of the
headlines this winter, through his high scoring accuracy,
but several veteran squadmen are also playing major roles in
the 1949 version of the Spessard court epic.

Joe Auer, a °47 transfer from West Virginia University,
has sparked the Blue five in early contests. It was Auer who
slated away a recent 64-58 victory over Roanoke College by
dumping three quick baskets in the final minute of play.

Bob Goldsmith, playing his second year at center for the
Generals, has been facing double-thick defenses all season but
has still connected for an average 14 points per game. No-
toriously near-sighted, Goldsmith recently received new shat-
ter-proof glasses. His first comment: “So that’s what the
basket looks like!”

Auer and Handlan have been playing the forward po-
sitions, and Goldsmith at center. In addition, coach Spessard
has a capable pair of starting guards.

Fred Vinson, Captain of the team, is playing out his last
year of eligibility. As in past seasons, he’s the man who keeps
his teammates steady under fire.

Although Steve Ulaki labors under the handicap of a
“trick” knee, he handles the other guard post in an efficient,
aggressive manner. Most valuable as a floor-player, Ulaki
makes few points but is always a crowd-pleaser with his
fake-pass antics.

Behind these five stand a group of seasoned and depen-
dable reserves, including forwards George Pierson and Chris
Compton; and guards Ed Thomas and Jim Fahey.

Washington and Lee dropped a sleeper to East Tennessee
State 50-44 in the season’s opener, but came right back,
to defeat George Washington 59-53. On the holiday road
trip W. and L. lost to Western Kentucky 89-43, and to Mor-
ris-Harvey 68-67. They dropped one more to Duke at Lynch-
burg, 58-45, before smacking University of Virginia, 75-66, on
the Cavaliers’ home court.

Following the Virginia victory Spessard’s quintet lost two
more—to William and Mary 42-39 and North Carolina 69-
52—and then evened accounts by winning two important ones
from Virginia Tech, 66-58, and Roanoke College, 64-58. For
good measure, the Generals rolled up a 73-48 count against
Fort Meade just before examinations.

Wrestling Coach Harry Broadbent’s major problem this
season seems to be attempting to keep his matmen at Wash-
ington and Lee. Southern Conference 175-pound titleholder
Bob Mahoney left the university last spring, and following
latest exams 121l-pound SC champion Cal Guest has with-
drawn. Guest had been out of action part of this season, re-
turning several weeks ago to pin his opponent when the Gen-
erals met and defeated Auburn, Southeast Conference cham-
pions last winter.

However, W. and L,. still looks like the team to win the

Southern Conference mat crown again this year. Such gs
wart veterans as Ted Lonergan (128-pound class), Joe Sco
(136), Ken Finley (145), Irv Wicknick (155), Ken Lind
(165), Bill Metzel (175) and Jerry Jack (Heavyweight). —

In five matches this winter the Generals have registe
victories over Virginia, Hofstra, Auburn, and Newport Ney
while dropping a single match to Lehigh. Meanwhile
freshman squad has won two straight, from Virginia Sche
for Blind, and Jefferson of Roanoke.

Freshman basketball coach Carl Wise is also pretty ha
py about his corps of first-year cagers, who haven't yet los
game, and look like a lead-pipe cinch to race off with t
state frosh title.

Boys like Talbot Trammell, Harry Deweese, Chuck Groy
Gil Bocetti, and Dave Hedge have been the sparks in th
Brigadiers’ victory drive.

WAR CRIMES

An amazing turn in the investigation of war crimes
Germany recently made public is revealed in what Tim
magazine terms an “incredible report” submitted to the U.
Supreme Court and the U.S. Army on the notorious Msg
medy massacre of American soldiers captured by the Germart
in the Battle of the Bulge late in 1944. Handling the invest
gation and subsequent report which transformed what ha
originally appeared as an open-and-shut case in the Germa
war crimes trials into something far more sinister was
lanta lawyer Willis Meade Everett, Jr., class of 1920.

Everett, president of the Washington and Lee alumft
chapter in the Georgia capitol, had been appointed by th
United States to serve as defense counsel for 73 Germar
brought to trial for the Malmedy massacre. After all the Ge
mans had been found guilty of atrocities at Malmedy, 43 ¢
them sentenced to death, Everett spent two years, at his o
expense, pleading the case. As Time reveals, “Everett wa
no longer defending the Germans, most of whom he believe
guilty; he was defending justice.”

An Army commission set up to review Everett's finding
finally corroborated the Everett report that U. S. prosect
tion teams had confessions from the Germans through
series of brutalities not unlike the misery to which the Ge
mans had exposed their American prisoners at Malmedy.
a result of Everett’s sensational disclosure, a U.S. commis
sion has commuted the death sentences of 31 of the 43 cor
demned Germans and recommended clemency for the r
maining twelve.
