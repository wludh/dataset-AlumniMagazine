cA MESSAGE TO CALL cALUMNI
The success of the Class Agent Alumni Fund
Campaign for 1945 is now in your hands.

The Alumni Board of Trustees is endeavor-
ing to make 1945 an outstanding year.

We invite the careful consideration of your
Class Agent’s letter.

KI WILLIAMS, President

The cAlumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

The President's Page

HIS PAGE is a special word to the alumi, one of the
Vea sincere and most urgent words | have ever ven-
tured to speak. It is a comment I recently made to the
Trustees: I have unlimited faith in the large future of
Washington and Lee but we face, almost certainly, a
period—possibly two years—of as great difficulty as
anything since the days of Lee.

* * *

1. Our student enrollment may touch 100 during
the session, but there will not be that many boys on the
campus at any one time. A considerable element of these
students is made up of the pre-eighteen group who snatch
a semester or two before reporting for military duty.
We are not lowering standards of selection; and the
boys of even the small student body are sustaining our
best traditions and customs.

* * *

2. The Selective Service Act, requiring these boys to
give themselves to the cause of the country, will probably
continue in effect for the duration of the whole war and
possibly for any immediate military consequences.

* * *

3. The return of the “college material” veterans will
be slow. According to present plans demobilization will
be in stages; the men first released will be the casualties,
then the older men, probably the married men; it 1s con-
ceivable, though there is no such assurance, that men
may be released for important tasks in critical industry.

i ee
4. If the proposed manpower legislation, or any com-

parable act, is passed, it will greatly disturb the attend-
ance of the 4-F boys, now about half of our enrollment.

* * *

5. The armed forces are withdrawing most of the
military units of regular students; we lost ours in May,

1944. We still rent certain facilities to the Army School
for Personnel Services, an utterly different arrangement
from that with the ASTP unit which we instructed ; but
there is no guarantee that our rental contract will be
maintained for any given length of time.

2K * *

If thus boldly I lay before the alumni facts that
threaten to make the next two or three years bleak, I
shall ask permission to urge certain conclusions. Ob-
viously the sympathy and the help of alumni are not
only important but essential.

* x *

We need the assistance represented in the class-agent
plan more than we have ever needed it, the money of
course but also the enlistment of continuing interest.
The encouragement brought to us in this way is a value
that cannot be estimated.

* * K

Alumni who may be able will, we pray, consider the
matter of special gifts, either from themselves as indi-
viduals or from corporations in which they exercise the
legal influence that would authorize such generosity. Cer-
tain alumni are already helping in this way.

* k *

Alumni may encourage and even inform the veterans
as to their return for additional training when circum-
stances permit. We are anxious for the return of our
own students whose careers were interrupted, and for
the coming of the other boys who in normal times would,
or might, have chosen Washington and Lee.

* *x *

Concerning any of these points, hurriedly suggested
here, I should welcome correspondence from any alum-
nus or friend.

A History of the W&L Alumni Fund

oO HIsToRY of the Alumni Fund can be separated
from the name of Walter McDonald. While serving

as President of the Alumni Association in 1931-1934,
after a trip covering practically all of the Eastern and
Southern states with the Alumni Secretary, he estab-
lished the Class Agent Plan at
Washington and Lee, under
the direction of John Darnall,
who worked out the details for
three months in Mr. McDon-
ald’s office in Cincinnati, and
then came to Lexington to in-
stall it in the Alumni Office.

The Alumni Board of ‘Trus-
tees, as well as the Alumni
Secretary, were not at that
time wholeheartedly in favor
of the establishment of the
plan at Washington and Lee,
but their reluctance was over-
come by Mr. McDonald's en-
thusiasm for it, and it was
agreed to put it on trial.

Mr. Darnall remained in
lexington for three years, su-
pervising the setting up of the
Class Agents Plan, and at the
same time reorganizing the
work of the Alumni Office,
with suggestions and coopera-
tion from Mr. McDonald.

Starting in the spring of
1933, the returns, in both num-
ber and amount of contribu-
tions have shown a steady increase, except for the year
1936, when there was a slight falling off due to the fact
that alumni were also solicited during that year for funds
to be used in rebuilding the Law Building, which had
been destroyed by fire during the previous winter.

Contributions to the fund have been used in building
the much-needed Alumni Intramural Field, to furnish the
Annie Jo White Memorial Browsing Room in the McCor-
mick Library, having a portrait painted of Dr. James
Lewis Howe, and toward the construction of an addi-
tional room in the Chemistry Building, assistance in fi-
nancing the Law Review, besides making the Almni Of-

 

Walter McDonald, ’10

fice self-supporting, and turning over all “Unrestricted”
gifts directly to the University treasury.

The Washington and Lee Alumni Fund is the most
effective avenue through which the alumni may give ex-
pression to their feeling of gratitude and loyalty to Alma
Mater. Aside from the finan-
cial returns, the revival of in-
terest in the University among
the alumni has been almost
startling. The exchange of let-
ters each year between the
Class Agents and their class-
mates, instead of becoming
hackneyed on account of the
annual repetition, have in-
creased in warmth and enthus-
lasm, as well as in more con-
crete evidence of these senti-
ments in money returns. Every
line of news in the public press,
as well as in the dlimni Mag-
azine and the News Letters
and Bulletins from the Uni-
versity, are eagerly read and
commented upon, displaying
an intelligent and constructive
interest in University affairs.

The Alumni Board of ‘Trus-
tees and the Alumni Secretary
are now unanimous in their
approval of the Class Agent
Plan and feel that its adoption
has been the greatest forward
step taken by the Association,
and that the entire credit for its inauguration should go
to Walter McDonald. The record is as follows:

 

Year Contributions Amount
1933 505 $3,741.00
1934 660 4,524.00
1935 645 3,440.00
1936 612 3,708.00
1937 618 4,559.00

Contributors to the Alumni Fund in 1944.

E TAKE PRIDE in listing below the names of those
Wi. contributed to the 1944 Alumni Fund. Our
objective was to raise $15,000 from 1500 individuals.
The result—$15,811.72 from 1542 alumni is tangible
evidence of the continued interest and ever increasing
loyalty of Washington and Lee men to their Alma Mater.
This list does not include the names of many alumni
who replied to their Class Agent’s letter without send-
ing a contribution although their response is greatly ap-
preciated. The results of the 1944 Fund are most en-
couraging and lead us to believe that its potentialities
are far greater than anyone had anticipated.

We acknowledge a debt of gratitude to all alumni
who responded and to the Agents themselves who have
supplied the medium by which all alumni can have a
material part in the support of the University.

Within a short time the Class Agents for 1945 will
be mailing their letters. This service is a labor of love
for the University. The job they have undertaken is a
big one, accepted at personal sacrifice, with the confidence
that their classmates will cooperate.

Our goal for 1945 is $20,000 from 2,000 alumni.
Help us reach it by replying promptly to your Class

Agents’s letter.

“Last fall I had a very pleasant visit with Edward Mc-
Dowell Moore, whom we had known as Stiffy Moore, when
I was in Lexington. You will recall him as a guard and tackle
on the football team. He has been in the Southwest and over
the country pretty generally, during a number of years past,
engaged in engineering work on various Government projects.
The other day he was in town again and I had another very
pleasant visit with him, going over old times. He left with
me a book written by his father, ‘A Cannoneer of the Rock-
bridge Artillery,’ which I have read with very considerable
interest. I spent about six weeks prior to entering Washing-
ton and Lee, in September, 1898, at Rockbridge Baths with
Captain Tom Williamson, who was coaching me in Latin
and one or two other subjects preparatory to entering Wash-
ington and Lee. Captain Williamson and I had a very pleasant
stay together at Mrs. Horn’s, just across North River from
the covered bridge above Rockbridge Baths, and he often
told me of incidents which happened when he was a member
of the Rockbridge Artillery in the Civil War. Reading this
book has recalled to my mind some of my conversations with
Captain Williamson.”

Stuart Chevalier, not content with a law business that
reaches from Los Angeles to Washington, D. C., has rein-
forced his bid for posthumous fame with a second book,

Was up there last fall. I love to go back. It affects me some-
thing like going to Church. I may not understand what I am
absorbing or why, but after I have been there I feel better,
and just to visit the place makes me feel that I have been in
touch with and in the presence of something much greater
and far higher than I am. I wish I could have known that
when I was there, for that realization does us all good.”

United States Chamber of Commerce:

“Discussions of an exploratory nature have just been con-
cluded in London with a view to negotiating a treaty between
the United States and Great Britain for the avoidance of
double taxation. Announcement was made that the first
phase of the conversations dealing with double taxation on
incomes and death duties have been ‘satisfactorily concluded.’
The conversations are to be resumed shortly in Washington.

One of the war’s strangest sights, believes 2nd Lt. William
M. Sterrett, is an artillery-rocked battlefield from 20,000 feet
altitude—such as the battlefield during the initial stages of
the German thrust through Belgium which Lt. Sterrett wit-
nessed as he flew to participate in an attack on the Wehr-
macht’s rear communications. The Virginian is pictured on
page 29 in flying clothes following a mission in his B-17 Fly-
ing Fortress, “Bette-la-Belle.” Lt. Sterrett and other bom-
bardiers of the 100th group got heart-warming results on their
mission—literally wrecking marshalling yards at Kaisers-
lautern, as reconnaisance “strike” photos later proved. An
ammunition train, undoubtedly headed for the Wehrmacht,
was blown up, and trains wrecked. Lt. Sterrett was recently
awarded the Air Medal in recognition of “exceptionally meri-
