Opportunity Unique

Embarrassed as I am in thus offering one more state-
ment on that “loaves and fishes’ theme, I must yield to a
sincere desire to tell the alumni how much promise the
annual alumni fund holds. It is the opportunity unique. It
can do for us some things, some most important things,
that cannot otherwise be realized.

RO aes ee

Every year many needs or chances for improvement
become obvious to us. Some of them are comparatively
small, some of them of almost major significance. To
meet these needs is a problem of first magnitude, not only
because our funds are limited but also because—and not
everybody understands this fact—our funds must be
sacredly devoted to the purposes for which the funds are
given or allocated.

as ge te

For example, we have at this moment a need for im-
proving the instructional facilities of one or two of our
best divisions. The cost will be between five and ten
thousand dollars. It is an urgent need, so urgent that it
gives me distress for the high standards of this Univer-
sity. I could demonstrate that need, I am sure, in five
minutes to any fair-minded person.

ee ee

But the stubborn question before us is this: Where
shall we get that particular—let us say—eight thousand
dollars? Against what item in our accounting could we
charge this expenditure ?

 

* * * *K X

No ethical institution would take endowment money
and use it for this type of facility ; such a procedure would

be almost the height of academic immorality. Nor can we
justifiably take money out of the operating income for
permanent improvement, as distinct from current repairs.
Any school that used much of its operating income for
these permanent improvements would lay itself open to
one or both of two indictments: paying the teachers too
little or charging the students too much. The operating
fund is just what it says—for operation of the current

educational effort.
ie Ogee ee ae

If we had ten million dollars of endowment and a mil-
lion dollars of this operating fund, the facts would be ap-
proximately as I have implied. The capital funds, the
money earned from them, and the fees must be faithfully
used for the purposes indicated.

* * *K KX X

Nothing could possibly help Washington and Lee more
than a flexible fund, to be expended for those miscellane-
ous causes which merit the approval of all of us who love
the University. If we had such a fund of, let us be bold
in aspiration, fifty thousand dollars, the possibilities would
be beautiful. Such a fund, incidentally, would be the
equivalent of income on more than a million dollars, an
income set entirely free to achieve the ever-fresh oppor-

tunity.
i Me ee ee

If enough of our alumni will consider thoughtfully this
type of need, we shall have a fund that will enormously
stimulate and strengthen our purposes. And we shall
have a testimonial of faith that will give courage to our
hearts.

The School of Commerce

 

Accounting Lab—Newcomb Hall

 

Size alone is a matter of no importance in an evaluation of
the Washington and Lee School of Commerce and Adminis-
tration. And yet its manageable size has given rise to a dec-
orous pride in the quality and personalized nature of the
class-room instruction. Among other criteria are nation-wide
recognition of present academic standards and attainments,
and the soundness of future objectives and policies.

Housed entirely in 68-year-old Newcomb Hall, renovated
and remodeled in 1936, the physical facilities consist of six
class rooms, a seminar room, a modern laboratory for ac-
counting and statistics, and a well-stocked Commerce library
and reading room.

44 Years Old

Authorized by action of the Board of Trustees in 1905 and
founded the following year, the School of Commerce owes
much to two men. For three of the four decades since his ar-
rival on the Washington and Lee campus, Dr. Glover D. Han-
cock served as dean of the School. He was joined in 1915 by a
friend and graduate school classmate, Dr. Robert H. Tucker,
who served subsequently as Dean of the University for fifteen
years and as Acting President for a year. Both men are now
lecturers in economics.

One of the first policies inaugurated by Dean Hancock, a
policy which has stuck, was limiting class sections to twenty-
five men. Somewhat larger sections were necessary immediate-
ly after the war, but enrollment is now near normal.

Faculty

At the conclusion of Washington and Lee’s 200th year, in
1949, Dean Hancock resigned the position he had held for 30
years. His successor is Professor Lewis Whitaker Adams
whose first connection with the School was from 1926 through
1929, a period in which the School was fighting for recognition.
Dean Adams returned to the faculty in 1940.

Known to hundreds of W. and L. alumni are the chairmen

of the four departments which make up the School of Go,
merce: Rupert N. Latture, Political Science; M. Ogden py
lips, Economics; Almand R. Coleman, Accounting; and Le,
K. Johnson, Commerce. The appointment of Dr. Phillips
Dr. Johnson as department heads was effective with
opening of the current session. Instruction is given by a fac
ulty of fifteen.

Impressive Record

Characterized by a leading educator and business man q
one of the three best undergraduate schools of business
the nation, the School is proud of the alumni who have broyg}
it this distinction—accountants, bankers, business men, edu
cators, farmers, lawyers and statesmen alike.

An increasing number of its students are continuing the
work in the best graduate schools, and their records have beg
enviable. Only this year, one of them won a top scholarshj
at M.I.T. Others are doing well at schools such as Harve
and Penn.

Formal Recognition

National recognition came in 1927 at which time the Schog
of Commerce was admitted to membership in the America
Association of Collegiate Schools of Business. This Associa
tion was founded in 1916 by such schools as Harvard, Colun
bia, and Chicago for the purpose of promoting and improy
ing higher business education in North America. As of 194
only 59 schools had been admitted to membership in the 4
sociation, and, of these, Washington and Lee had the smalle
student body by a margin of about 2000.

In order to belong to the Association, member sch
must require not less than 48 semester hours and not mor
than 72 semester hours in business and economic subjects. 4
a division of a liberal arts college, the School of Commere
lays stress on a balanced education and on sound trainin
in the principles of business and public administration. If
requirement of a 48 semester hour interdepartmental maje
gives relative freedom of individual choice in the selection ¢
courses both in commerce and in the arts and sciences.

Proud of Library

No librarian is on duty in the Commerce library; no supé
vision is the rule. It operates entirely under the Honor Sys
tem. Stacks filled with a half-century collection are open t
Juniors and Seniors by day and by night. The atmosphere ¢
this two-story room is conducive to study and research, an
the equipment was built for the purpose.

More to Come

Under the leadership of Dean Adams, plans for improve
scholarship and teaching are in prospect.

Keeping abreast of changing trends is consistent with tf
fundamental principle that a student’s education should be
broad as possible. Washington and Lee was among the fi
to include in its curricula work in Foreign Service and 1?
Public Administration. The fact that the government is t
day the largest employer of college-trained men has led toi
creased interest in these fields of study. Moreover, the maf
complexities of national and international economic and pé
litical life have led to a growing interest on the part of §
dents who want to assume the role of informed and use
citizens. |

——_

Basic training in business administration in combination
ath chen istry, engineering, geology, or physics is gaining
4 r appeal. Here, too, breadth not specialization is the ob-
wi a and cooperation on the part of the science depart-
- ‘has been excellent. The aim is to provide training for

ments teow : :
mployment in industrial enterprises.
4 ¢ . . “ . . . . . . .
In addition to the Foreign Service, Public Administration,

and Industrial Management groups, the School of Com-
merce Pi vides opportunity for study and understanding of
other bran hes ot business. The Accounting group offers the
subjects and technical training necessary for professional
accountants. The Banking and Finance group is intended for
those students who wish to specialize in commercial or in-
yvestment banking or in corporation finance. The Business
jdministration group emphasizes the fundamental principles
of business policy and administration.

Commenting on future objectives, Dean Adams said: “The
School of Commerce cannot train individuals for the mani-
fold and intricate specialties of business life. It can, however,
give them a general education, a trained mind, and an appre-
ciation of knowledge, which, it is hoped, will lead to graduate
study and to reading and study in later years. To this end,
continuous stress on outstanding teaching is essential.”

 

TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF FOREIGN SERVICE

James Somerville, Foreign Service Officer, has been trans-
ferred to the Department of State from Teheran where he
was First Secretary. He has been stationed at Teheran dur-
ing the past five years. Before going to Teheran, he was as-
signed to London for eighteen years, as a member of the
foreign service of the Department of Commerce from June,
1926, until commissioned in the Foreign Service in July, 1939,

and as a Foreign Service Officer from July, 1939, until early *

in 1944. Mr. Somerville was born at Vaiden, Mississippi, was
graduated from the public schools there, received his A.B.
and M.A. degrees from Washington and Lee in 1912 and 1913
respectively, and did further graduate work at Washington
and Lee in 1913-1914, and at Johns Hopkins University in
1919-1920. While doing graduate work here he taught history,
and history and English at Marion, Alabama, Military In-
stitute in 1914-1915, and in 1915-1917 was headmaster of
Chamberlain-Hunt Military Academy at Fort Gibson, Mis-
Sissippi. During and after World War I, he did war work
with the American Y.M.C.A. in Russia.

EXCERPT FROM A BICENTENNIAL LETTER

“Each of us can tell of the little things that made our
college careers so meaningful, and stamped us for life with
the spirit of Washington and Lee. I recall the friendliness
among students, the training corps of World War I, the paint-
ing of the columns with VMI colors, eating at table with
daughter of General R. E. Lee, the victory over Georgia Tech,
the graciousness of Major W. A. Anderson, the sincere in-
terest of instructors, The Honor System Canteen, writing
copy for The Ring-tum Phi, the Fancy Dress Ball, Bill Tuck
and other embryo statesmen, Mel Trotter’s services, the
Swing, term papers and items without number.

“My confidence is surer, my mind is keener, my under-
standing is broader, my determination to serve others is more
positive, and among other things, my faith is deeper. Indeed,
thou art my lovely mother, Washington and Lee, and never
will I forget thy love and watchful care over me.”

 

WILLIAM M. McELWEE, ’79

William M. McElwee, ’79, celebrated his 90th birthday on
January 5, 1950. While a student at Washington and Lee,
Mr. McElwee was catcher on the famous baseball team which
saw the first curved ball pitched in the South by his class-
mate, George A. Sykes. Portraits of Mr. McElwee and Mr.
Sykes are hanging in the Alumni Offices at the University.
Mr. McElwee has been president of the Peoples National
Bank in Lexington from 1925 until his resignation from this
office a few weeks ago and was made honorary chairman
of the board by the bank’s board of directors. He has for many
years been an elder in the Lexington Presbyterian church.

Robert E. Lee, Superintendent of U. S. Military Academy,
1852-1855

 

Valued at a figure of around a half a million dollars, the
collection of paintings which hang in Lee and Washington
Chapels on the Washington and Lee campus present an im-
pressive picture of both history and art to the observer.

The paintings of famous personages connected in the past
with the University by one means or another have mainly been
presented by alumni and friends. Some, such as the first pic-
ture ever painted of Washington, have a large monetary
value; while others gain their importance from the stories be-
hind them.

Hanging in a position of prominence in Lee Chapel, is
found the soft-touched painting of George Washington in the
uniform of a Colonel in the British Colonials. The picture
is insured for a value of $200,000, but being the first picture
of Washington ever painted, many have valued it at sums
greater than this. It was done by Peale for Washington, and
since that time has passed through the Washington and Lee

families at Mt. Vernon and Arlington to its present Plac
rest.
At the same time Peale did Washington, which he name
the “Virginia Colonel,” he also painted the first reproductic
of Lafayette, which hangs with the former as a sister Paintin
The two have been together since that time, and as ar
their value is greatly increased. :
Another famous Washington painting hanging jn 4
Chapel is one of the 68 original Stuart Washingtons, painte
on a piece of wood. Because of this surface, some h:
doubted the authenticity of the work, but many experts hay
positively identified it as one of the originals. 3
One picture with an interesting story behind it as we
as being valued for its artistic attributes is the one of Thom:
A. Scott, Assistant Secretary of War under Lincoln. A pe
thumous portrait, it was done in London by V. A. Vinte
Following the War Between the States, Scott gave Gener
Lee a donation for the school amounting to $70,000,
since that time his picture has hung at the University to shoy
how he attempted to rebuild relations with the South throug
Washington and Lee.
Another interesting portrait, which has been known
shock the observer at first notice, is that of a young, ¢
haired Lee in the Blue uniform of the North. The origin
of this painting, done in 1931 by Ernest L. Ipsen, hangs
West Point, where Lee was superintendent in 1852—the tir

e

commands a position of importance in the main lobby
Washington Chapel.

One of the most famous pictures of Lee is the one painte
in 1904 by Theodore Pine, from memory and in admiration fe
the Southern General. It is recognized as a valuable piece
art, although many have been heard to comment that it make
the General look “too pretty,” taking much of his stalwé
character from him.

Also hanging on the wall of the Chapel named after am
dedicated to him is the last picture ever painted of Lee. Al
though there is some question as to the actual time, it is be
lieved he sat for the work about a year before his death. Dom
by a Frenchman, John Dabour, it is one of the few reprodut
tions of Lee which show him in civilian clothes. It presem
a final tribute to the General, then President of the Universit}
depicting the lined face, yet still maintaining the glowing eye

One of the finest paintings of the famous Supreme Cow
Justice John Marshall also hangs in the Chapel, beside a pe
trait of his brother, Louis, who was President of W. and 1
from 1830 to 1834. The picture of John was done by Cheste
Harding and recently presented to the University; while
artist who did Louis is to this day unknown.

One of the most valued pieces of art belonging to W. a
L. is the actual artist’s model of an equestrian statue ‘
Robert E. Lee, presented to the University by the sculpte
E. P. Proctor, because of its symbolic importance. Shov
Lee on horseback leading a young man, it depicts the
spirit of his association with the school which bears his nau
The full-size statue was unveiled in Dallas, Texas, in 1936
President Roosevelt.

Two other valuable paintings which adorn the walls |
the Chapel are the originals of Harding’s Jefferson and Healy

a |

\ifadison. These two pieces have been valued at over a hundred
¢housand dollars, and have been the property of the school
for many years.

From Mt. Vernon have come three famous pictures by
Wallaston which depict much of the history of George Wash-
ington’s family and life. These paintings are of Washington’s
wife, the then Mrs. Custis, and her family. Their waxy fea-
tures with smooth-drawn lines give them a prefabricated ap-
earance, although they are recognized among aartistic cir-

cles for this novel effect.

Perhaps most interesting of all the paintings, despite the
fact that it has little actual value, is the one which has been
claimed to be Robert E. Lee’s mother. Bought in Rome many
years ago, it was presented to Washington and Lee as Lee’s
mother. Upon her breast hangs a medallion of Washington,
which in the minds of many substantiated the theory of who
it was. However, when it was given, a servant who had worked
in the Lee home while he was President announced it couldn't
be her because she had had brown eyes, and those in the pic-
ture were blue. When cleaned, though, the eyes turned brown,
and hopes were again aroused. They were short-lived, how-
ever, when the professional cleaner announced that the me-
dallion had also been a job of re-touching—he could also
remove it if desired. The medallion still remains—and the
story with it!

And so the impressive collection hangs, in silent memory
of the persons and stories for which it stands. Every day,
countless sightseers stop on the Washington and Lee cam-
pus and view the startling assortment of personages familiar
to them all—and those who have time may even stop and
learn a little of the anecdotes which lie behind each of the
reproductions.

 

New Literary Publication

Washington and Lee has taken another step forward.
To fulfill the need of an outlet for serious literary expression,
the University has established a new magazine, Shenandoah,
which will be published as a quarterly containing fiction,
verse, and various types of criticism.

Students, faculty, alumni, and outside contributors will fill
its forty-eight pages with what the editors hope will be the
best obtainable exhibition of literary and artistic endeavor.
The publication will fill a long felt lack at Washington and
Lee, and should be a credit to the reputation of the Univer-
sity in the eyes of its family and friends.

_ The impetus for Shenandoah was given late in 1949 by two
interested groups simultaneously. A small faculty group had
been discussing with the Dean of the University the possi-
bilities of such a venture at the same time that the faculty
received a petition from one of the newly revitalized campus
literary societies, the Washington Literary Society, request-
mg such a publication. This showed that there was great
imterest in the idea on the part of both students and faculty.

he Graham-Lee Society added its hearty endorsement to
the project, and Shenandoah shortly began to take shape. The
Name was chosen by the editorial board with the feeling that
tt would have strong local associations, and would give the
Magazine a geographical focus.

Shenandoah will operate outside the sphere of the student
Publications board, as it has joint student and faculty support,
and is not in direct competition with any of the other campus
Publications. No local advertising will be solicited, and the
New magazine will not be included in the regular “Campus

ax,” as its primary aim is to encourage creative writing

 

Peale’s George Washington

 

rather than to be conducted as a money-making venture. Its
main support, consequently, will come from subscriptions.

Student Staffed

The staff of Shenandoah consists of three student editors
and their assistants, a business manager, and a faculty board
of review, composed of four outstanding men from the de-
partments of English and American Studies. Two of the
student editors were chosen by the campus literary societies,
and the third from the student body at large. The Washington
Literary Society elected Dave Kerr, and the Graham-Lee So-
ciety chose Jerry Donovan. The third editor is T. K. Wolfe.
Mr. B. $. Ford has been appointed chairman of the faculty
committee, whose other members are Professors Ashley
Brown, G. H. Foster, and Marshall Fishwick.

The editorial functions have been divided into three de-
partments—fiction, verse, and criticism—with one of the
student editors in charge of each. All material submitted is
judged by the whole editorial staff, but the final decision rests
with each department editor and his assistants. The faculty
board functions largely in an advisory capacity, furnishing
a more mature judgment in matters of policy and selection.

Contributions Desired

The staff is eager to obtain literary contributions from
alumni, as Shenandoah is designed for Washington and Lee
men of the past and the present. In accordance with this pol-
icy, the magazine has been fortunate in obtaining from
Thomas Sugrue,’’29, a hitherto unpublished preface to his

Doctor James L. Howe Owns
Life Company's Oldest
Premium-Paying Policy

A new and interesting distinction
has come to Dr. James Lewis Howe,
Professor Emeritus, Washington and
Lee University, as revealed by Philip F.
Howerton, class of 1925, General Agent
of the Connecticut Mutual Life Insur-
ance Company at Charlotte. Mr. How-
erton learned that Dr. Howe was the
owner of a policy in his company
bought many years ago and asked his
Home Office to look into its relative
age. It was determined that Dr. Howe
is the owner of the oldest premium-
paying policy in force in that Company.

It was in 1877 that young eighteen-
year-old Jimmy Howe paid the first
premium on his Connecticut Mutual
Life insurance policy. During the en-
suing years, he has paid the premiums
as they became du: and today at 91
has the distinction o- being the owner
of the oldest premium-paying policy
on the books of that 104-year-old Com-
pany, in which there are over 480,000
life insurance policies in force.

There are interesting sidelights in
connection with Dr. Howe’s policy.
His father, also a policyowner of The
Connecticut Mutual, was a medical ex-
aminer for the Company and recom-
mended his son for the insurance. As
his son’s physician, the elder Dr. Howe

 

Doctor Howe about 1878 when he pur-

chased his Connecticut Mutual life

insurance policy

Permit issued to Doctor Howe

side any place in the temperate
zone

reported to the Company that young
James “has never been sick excepting
for scarletina when he was nine years
old and for a fractured leg at 12.” In
answer to the question as to his son’s
temperament, height and general ap-
pearance, he reported, “nervous tem-
perament, height, 5’9”, appearance,
healthy.” His opinion as to his son’s
prospects for longevity, “good like
his father and mother.” The tests of
insurability in 1877 were considerably
less exacting than they are _ today.
However, Dr. Howe’s long life indi-

Front page of Doctor Howe’s po
issued on September 29, 1877

cates that the mortality experience c
policyowners of these older days f
been very satisfactory.

Although relatively lenient as ft
required medical examinations for it
policies, the Company, like all others
at that time, had incorporated in th
same policies rather definite trave
restrictions. Dr. Howe’s policy o
nally limited his traveling or place ¢
residence even within the temperatt
zone! Southern Georgia and practically
the entire state of Florida, for example
were “out of bounds” during the perioe
from July 1 to November 1, and
during that time the insured so mu

States lying south of the 32nd paralle

consent of the Company, his poli¢)
would have become “null and voide
In 1895, however, the Company issue
a permit to Dr. Howe which’ allows
him to travel or reside any place
in the temperate zone. During the i
tervening years all such restriction!

Two New Trustees

John Randolph Tucker, Richmond attorney, and Chris-
topher T. Chenery, New York utilities executive, have been
appointed to the Washington and Lee University board of
trustees.

The appointments were made at a trustees’ mid-winter
meeting, held January 20 in Washington, to replace vacancies
created by the deaths of Dr. George Bolling Lee, 93, of New
York, in 1948, and Harry St. George Tucker Carmichael, ’99,
of Bowling Green, Kentucky, last September.

Two additional vacancies in its membership remain to be
flled by the Washington and Lee board. New members will
be named later to succeed two of the university’s veteran
trustees, John W. Davis, 92, New York attorney, and Wil-
liam McChesney Martin, ’95, St. Louis banker, who were
made trustees emeriti last fall.

Mr. Davis, 1924 Democratic presidential nominee and for-
mer American Ambassador to Great Britain, has served the
university since 1921, part of the time as rector of the board.
Mr. Martin, former governor and later president of the Feder-
al Reserve Bank of St. Louis, was appointed a trustee in 1928.

 

J. Randolph Tucker, ’00

 

C. T. Chenery, ’09

Mr. Tucker holds Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws
degrees from Washington and Lee and has practiced law in
Richmond since 1903. He is a former president of the Vir-
ginia State Bar Association. Both his father and grandfather
served terms as dean of the Washington and Lee School of
Law, and his son, John Randolph Tucker, Jr., was graduated
in law at Washington and Lee in 1948.

Mr. Chenery is also an alumnus of the university, having
received an engineering degree in 1909. He is president of
the Federal Water and Gas Corporation, and chairman of
the board of Southern Natural Gas Company and of a number
of other utilities corporations. During the university’s 200th
anniversary celebration, 1948-1949, Mr. Chenery served as
executive chairman of the national bicentennial committee.

Prominent in Virginia as a sportsman, Mr. Chenery main-
tains a farm as Doswell, Virginia, “The Meadows,” head-
quarters for a string of thoroughbred horses well known at
leading tracks throughout the nation. He is a member of
the Deep Run Hunt and the Country Club of Virginia in
Richmond.

Report of the 1949 Alumni Fund

The statistical report on the preceding page of the 1949
Alumni Fund records the largest amount of money received
in any one year through the Fund. Of the total amount of
money, $20,459.48, forty-seven percent, or $12,481.50, was re-
ceived through the Alumni Fund, but designated for the Bi-
centennial, in addition to the $37,697.76 contributed by alumni
direct to the Bicentennial office.

In 1949, 1178 alumni contributed to the Alumni Fund. The
falling off in the number of contributors of approximately 700
from our high in 1946 is due to the fact that a large number of

you will find the names of Class Agents for the Alumni Fund
for 1950. You will soon be receiving a personal letter from
your agent, who has, as an expression of his loyalty to the
University and his classmates, accepted this service. You are
urged to give him an immediate response and assist him in
any way possible in making the 1950 Alumni Fund again the
best in its history.

The “Stephens Plan”

In an effort to assure financial success and at the same
time more enjoyable dance sets on the Washington and Lee
campus, word came in October of the brand new “Stephens
Plan.”

Through this new idea, students can buy tickets for all
four dance sets for the nominal price of $21—paid at the first
of the year. This allows the Dance Board Business Manager
(who this year is Gerry Stephens, father of the plan) to budget
for bigger dances with assurance of financial success.

Results were better than had been envisioned—more than
600 men signed up under the new system.

Speaking in an over-crowded Lee Chapel, Shirer told his
audience that his observation had shown him Germany was
still “the same old Germany.” The next day he was inter-

WREL.

To develop greater class spirit, they inaugurated the con-

Taxes—NO!

personal property taxes against all students at the rate of
$2.65 per $100 value.

After no small amount of disagreeable student sentiment
was shown, however, both governing bodies decided a week
later to table the idea “indefinitely.”

Fancy Dress of 1950

 

Reigning over the 44th Fancy Dress was King Arthur (Ar-
thur Wood, Jr.) and Queen Guinevere (Margaret Fritsche)

 

A long list of “firsts” and the largest crowd in many years
of Washington and Lee Dance Sets highlighted the 1950
Fancy Dress Ball held in Doremus Gymnasium on Friday
night, February 3. With President Art Wood of Chevy Chase,
Maryland, leading the figure, the students and their dates
danced for five hours on into the morning to the music of
Tex Beneke and his 24-piece orchestra.

The setting for the Ball of 1950 was a Castle of Camelot
in the period of 525 A.D., backing up the theme of King Ar-
thur and the Court of the Round Table. The scene was built
in three dimensions—one of the “firsts” the Set takes credit
for—and was as authentic as the history books it was copied
from.

Besides the three-dimensional scene, the Fancy Dress Ball
of 1950 resulted in three other “firsts” in the Dance Sets. On
Saturday, the smooth music of Glen Gray’s orchestra was im-
ported to change the tone of the affair. Also for the first time,
there were two concerts in the one week-end—an hour of
old Glenn Miller favorites on Friday night, and Glen Gray’s
offerings on Saturday afternoon. And to top off the prec-
edent-setting array, the decorations were handled, set and all,
entirely by students, at a saving of over $1500.

Almost 2000 persons—students and their dates, faculty
members, honored guests, and spectators—crowded the floor
and balcony Friday night for the colorful festivities as Dore-
mus Gymnasium bulged at its seams and resounded from
within.

Eighty students and dates were part of the massive figure
led by Wood and his date, Margaret Beverly Fritsche, from
Alexandria, Virginia. Included among the figure leaders were
Edward Gaines, son of the President, who was vice-president
in charge of publicity; John Chapman of Lexington and
Hack Heyward of Greensboro, North Carolina, who had
arranged the decorations; Mack Faris of Norfolk, Virginia,
vice-president in charge of costumes (of which more than

a thousand were purchased); and Bill Cogar of Charleston
West Virginia, the vice-president who handled preparations
for the figure.

And so another Fancy Dress passed, leaving behind jt a
memory and a handful of ideas for future generations. Fajy.
ing at the end of the first-semester exams this year, Spirits
were high, and the industrious leaders and arrangers of the
“biggest yet” Dance Set left no one dissatisfied.

The Home Edition

By John French, ’50

In November, 1948, a radio station began operation in
Lexington for the first time in history. With the opening of
the new station, WREL, also came the opening of a new era
‘in Journalism training for Washington and Lee students—
radio newscasting.

The station opened on fiunday, and the next evening the
W. and L. journalists went on the air with the first of their
fifteen minute newscasts. Since that time they have broad-
cast regularly five nights a week from the station’s studios
with a program of local news which has benefitted the stu-
dents, the station, and the listeners.

The program is conducted under the direction of the
Journalism Department, but is entirely student written. The
time at ten o’clock each week-day evening is given free to the
Department, and in turn the students put on the unsponsored
program free of charge—except for the experience gained.
And a recent poll of the listeners in Lexington and Rock-
bridge County showed that it is among the two most popular
programs on the air at any time of day. Some of those ques-
tioned even admitted that they have postponed their hour of
retiring in order to get the latest local news each night.

During the first semester of the school year, the students
who present the casts do it entirely voluntarily. The second
semester it is tied in with a course in Radio News, and this
course trains new men to carry oa the next year. Thus an
endless cycle of experienced men is kept available.

Each night, the program is put on by three students—
one for local news, one for the national spotlight, and a third
to cover sports. The total staff numbers nine, who alternate
nights so that each gets his fair turn. This compact trio is
each night in charge of writing and announcing the program,
working together without supervision or censorship.

At first, a major problem presented itself in the finding of
contacts with the townspeople who made logical news-
sources. Soon, however, everyone from the police department
to the United Daughters of the Confederacy became more
than friendly; even demanding their fair share of the evening
time. There have been times when these sources, now well-
developed, have felt deeply hurt if their news or special in-
terest was forced from the nightly cast by last-minute news.

In the gathering of the news, more students get to take
part, whether interested in the radio part of Journalism or
not. The members of the reporting and news writing classes
get a chance to obtain practice by covering beats each day
(police, fire, town and county, federal and state, and schools,
including W. and L. and VMI). A sixth man is also on general
assignment each day, and is given special assignments as they
Come up. Thus, the entire town and surrounding territory
Within reach of the station is completely covered during each
24-hour period.

At the end of the day, these reporters turn in their stories
at the news room of the station no later than eight o'clock.
Then is when the radio staff takes over. The national copy is
taken off the AP wire and re-written when necessary by the
National editor. The sports editor, who is allowed three min-
utes of air time, is completely in charge of his part of the
Program.

_ When the national editor has completed his three to four
Minutes of copy, he then joins the local editor who is busy
Preparing the most important of the newscast. He takes the

 

Home News Broadcast

 

stories handed in by the day’s beat-men—generally number-
ing between 15 and 20—boils them down, and re-writes them
in radio style.

The stories used on the newscasts are not censored either
by the station management or the Journalism Department;
yet, there has not been a single case of discrepancy in the
facts to date. Everyone connected with or even touched by
the program is quite satisfied with the results, and WREL
manager Phil Hirsch says “that is one program we couldn’t
afford to lose, although we couldn’t afford to give it without
these able apprentice radio newsmen.”

Since the inauguration of the program, there have been
countless requests from new men wishing to join the staff.
Because of its technical nature, however, the course in News
Writing has been set forth as a co-requisite for participation
on the program. The staff has become a closely-knit organi-
zation which revels in its prestige both on the campus and
in the town, and each man takes a professional pride in his
work.

When it first began, the staff was completely green in the
field of radio news, but under the direction of its teacher,
Professor C. O. Voigt, the members learned quickly. Since
that first hectic night when they took four hours to prepare
the program, they have now advanced into a smooth-running
group which does its task with the proficiency and speed of
the experts. Each takes an individual pride in being a part
of the collective Home Edition.

Thus the advent of a new step forward in the education
of Washington and Lee students—this time in the field of
Journalism. The new newscast has brought the Journalism
Department up to date in the field of radio, and provides the
best education possible for students interested in that field.
And besides offering such an opportunity for the students, it
has also acted as the best public relations contact with the
town of Lexington and Rockbridge County that the school
could ask for.

BASKETBALL

With thirteen games of their 1950 schedule behind them,
the Washington and Lee Comets of this year have shown
some improvement under their new coach, although they
haven’t been able to break into the win column but four times.
Two of the losses, however, have been by only two-point
margins, as the fighting five failed to get the necessary breaks
in the last minutes of play.

Sparking the team are the two high point lettermen—Jay
Handlan and George Pierson, along with Captain Chris
Compton. With this as the backbone, coach Con Davis has
molded a heavy-duty team with the will to win despite their
record.

As for the outlook for next year, Freshman coach Carl
Wise has a crew of five athletes who have bright prospects.
All have proven high scoring ability—just what the varsity
needs in their battle for wins. The five deserving mention
are: forwards Bill Scott and Chuck Bibby; center Jack Os-
borne; and guards Ben Walden and Harry Dawson.

The varsity record thus far this year follows in the adja-
Cent column.

After a slow start in their first two matches of the year,
this year’s Washington and Lee wrestling team has shown up
in its later encounters to pre-season expectations.

The grapplers are this year under the direction of an-

up largely of men from last year’s championship squad, in-
cluding Ted Lonergan, Irv Wicknick, and Ken Finley.

With their impressive record thus far, hopes for the squad
are great as they prepare to enter the competition for top
honors in the Southern Conference meet in March.

SWIMMING

Probably the most encouraging record of all the winter
sports has been chalked up by the W. and L. swimming team
in their first two encounters of the year.

Captain of this year’s squad is senior Ed Rushton who
has earned more than his share of points so far. Others who
have looked well in early competition include Don Steenburgh,
Jim Gallivan, and Tom Gardner.

Two sophomores also have proved to be main-stays of the
squad in its early meets—Mick McDonald in the hundred
yard free-style, and Bill Mills who swims breast stroke.

Freshman possibilities also promise to keep the swim-
mers strong for at least the next few years.

VMI COOPERATION

In an effort to allow both Washington and Lee and VMI
basketball and football teams to play to greater crowds in their
home contests, a new cooperative set-up has been begun this
year which will continue into the future.

By the arrangement, both W. and L. and VMI basketball
games are played in the recently converted VMI Riding
Hall, which now seats 3500 people for gymnasium contests.
This is the largest indoor gym in the state, and has stepped
up crowds for both single and double-header games greatly.

When football season rolls around, the field will change
to Washington and Lee’s Wilson Field. Here, VMI will be
allowed to play all its home football games—a great ad-
vancement for them considering their small and insufficient
