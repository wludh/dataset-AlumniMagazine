An Explanation

For the past several years the Alumni Office has pub-
lished a supplement to THe ALUMNI MAGAZINE listing
by classes the names of all contributors to the Alumni
Fund for the past year. On account of the shortage of
manpower in the University printing shop and also for
economic reasons we are combining the Report of the
Alumni Fund for 1943 with the January issue of the
Magazine. It has been necessary to eliminate special ar-
ticles, which usually appear in the Magazine, all pictures,
and to cut to the shortest possible space the material
used. This issue is being sent to the whole alumni list.

Pledge for the Future

(THE PRESIDENT’S PAGE)

wisH that every alumus who does me the honor of
I reading these lines could have been with me last night
at a little meeting in the Browsing Room of our new
library. Virtually the entire facutly—it’s down to little
gathered to discuss a report

 

more than half size now
from the Committee on Fraternities, a consideration of
the place and the function of these organizations in the
reconstruction of our academic life when normal days
come again.
ee oe

Every phase of the regular institutional life, the cur-
riculum, the modes of student guidance, the procedures of
student life, everything is now being studied with refer-
ence to future policies. The hope is to conserve all the
good in Washington and Lee and yet make such modifica-
tions as our own experience, or even the predictable cir-
cumstance of that coming day, may suggest.

2K K K

All colleges for men, perhaps more than ever before,
are a little bit dizzy now from trying to look at once in
the three-time directions, the past, the present, the future.

cS ok *K

When we look to what has gone before, we have mea-
surable pride. The mandates of our inheritance are being
fulfilled, largely in the magnificent performance of our
alumni. With more than twenty-five per cent of our
former students in our country’s uniform, with thousands
of others rendering essential services, either directly in
the war effort or the strengthening of the national life
which sustains that effort, the University has demon-
strated in this crisis that these generations of our boys
have responded to the spiritual legacies of our patron
saints.

ees

For the present, of course, our University, and this 1s
true of practically every college for men, lives upon the
basis of government contracts. We are drawing the bulk
of our income from the payments for the training of the
men in uniform, the pre-engineering and the pre-medical
A.S.T.P. whom we teach, and the School for Special

Service, to which we are renting certain University
properties. We have a conviction that to the great ma-
and the normal units bring about

 

jority of these men
800 of them to the campus—we are doing a service that
is more than the mere contractual obligation.

ok cr K

It is the future, of course, that gives us the immense
concern of this moment. When these contracts are with-
drawn, in those years of the transition, what circum-
stances will govern the attendance of boys upon higher
institutions ? Will the Government make proposals upon
special terms? Will there be a sustained emphasis upon
military training? Will the youth, urged by the quick
need for employment, turn predominantly to the voca-
tional or specialized types of training ?

K ok ok

To the alumni, however, now that we approach another
Class Agent campaingn, I repeat that, come what may,
we shall try to keep all that was best of the Washington
and Lee that you loved. I should like to feel, here close
to January 19, that we can salute the spirit of Lee and
say, “Sir, external circumstances bring their inevitable
change in external processes. But the heart of the Uni-
versity beats true forever to the ideals that you gave.”

2K ok *

And for the realization of that hope, we look with
eagerness to the continued aid that the alumni will give.
In the first of these campaigns, 505 alumni contributed
$3,741.00; last year 1409 alumni gave $12,301.75. Of
course this financial assistance was not the only means
of help. I could not find space here to list the various
ways and methods of alumni help.

ok K k

I pray that the sustaining interest of our alumni, ex-
pressed in this campaign and in every other way, will
not fail us now, when we really need it more than we
have ever needed it. As our alumni are the basis of our
pride, so are they the basis of our finest hope.

tude to these men and the Class Agents who have supplied

the medium by which all alumni can have a material part

in the support of the University.

In a few weeks you will receive your 1944 class letter.
The Class Agents are doing a very difficult and unselfish
service for the University in these strenuous days. You

can do your part by answering your Class Agent’s letter

promptly and thus making it unnecessary for him to

write you a follow-up letter.

Additions to List of Alumni in Service
As of January 31, 1944

Nore: This list of 99 alumni in service comprises the
seventh published addition to the list of Washington and
Lee men in service, published in the May, 1942, Maga-
sine. Washington and Lee now has 2630 alumni listed in
the armed forces.

In compliance with the military and naval authorities,
we have refrained from giving information about service
men save their class and branch of service, and indicating
whether or not they are commissioned officers. However,
the Alumni Office is vitally interested in other pertinent
data, such as actual rank, station, permanent home ad-
dress, or other address from which mail will be forward-
ed, special activities, type of service or training, etc. The
permanent home address is most important as service ad-
dresses change so rapidly.

It is our policy to keep as close a connection as possible
with our alumni in this time of stress, and any informa-
tion concerning alumni in service will be greatly appreci-
ated by this office.

lir the listing below, certain symbols have been used
to conserve space. hese symbols and their meaning are
as follows: A, Army of the United States; AAF, Army
Air Force; N, United States Navy; NAC, Naval Air

“College Friendships”

(A MESSAGE FROM YOUR ALUMNI PRESIDENT)

FTER five, ten, fifteen, or even more years have slipped
by since we trod the walks across the campus at
Washington and Lee, we cannot but feel—every last one
of us—genuine enjoyment in the revival of some of our
“College Friendships.”
No matter how many the years; no matter how busy
we are or what our situation is, we cannot deny that we
a real desire to see these

 

 

do have—from time to time
old friends. to hear about them, to read about them, and
to know what has become of them. Occasionally on a
trip we may bump into a classmate or friend. What an
event this is! With all the “remember whens’—and
“whatever became ofs.”” We go back home resolved to
keep in closer touch with “College Friendships.” But
due to the wide distribution of Washington and Lee
alumni, the serious difficulties of travel, and the every-
day business of making a living—such contacts with our

 

old college friends are few and far between.

There is, however, a way in which “College Friend-
ships” may be periodically revived—through the alumni
Class Agent plan and The Alwmni Magazine. Each year
an opportunity is available for one alumnus to write to
every member of his class. There is a tremendous kick
in that answering letter from Jack or Bill way off there
some place—the Class Agent didn’t even know where
until he got the address from the alumni office. I know
what this kick is like—I’ve been a Class Agent.

In addition to the personal pleasure of hearing from
some of his own friends, the Class Agent can add new
names to our growing list of active alumni, furnish in-
formation about them for the Magazine, and thereby
rekindle the spark of interest in other alumni. Just the
sight of a name may serve to keep alive a few of our
“College Friendships.”

Local Association Notes
New Orleans

A small group of Washington and Lee Alumni in New
Orleans met for lunch at Arnaud’s Restaurant on January 19.
It is hoped that this meeting will start a revival of activities
in the New Orleans area, although many alumni there are
in the service. Herbert Jahncke, ’30, is president of the New
Orleans group.

San Antonio

Washington and Lee Alumni of San Antonio, Texas, held
a Founders’ Day dinner on January 19 at the Milam Cafe-
teria Dining Room. The meeting was well attended in spite
of the fact that the majority of the alumni in that vicinity
are in the service, but their absence was compensated for, in a
way, by the presence of four service men who are stationed
in that area. Carl C. Wurzbach, ’15, is president of the San
Antonio chapter.

Chicago
Sixty-three members of the New York Washington and
Lee Alumni Association held a dinner meeting in the Astor
Gallery of New York’s Waldorf-Astoria on December 17. The
program ran the gamut from the sublime to the ridiculous,

and was highlighted by the re-election of Roy J. Grimley to
his third term as president of the Association. The guest
speakers were Dr. Francis P. Gaines, president of Washing-
ton and Lee University; Sidney Moseley and Stan Lomax of
the Mutual Broadcasting Company; University Trustees, the
Hon. John W. Davis, 92, and Dr. George Bolling Lee, 93,
and, as introduced by President Grimley, “the youngest
alumnus of them all, Dr. John M. Glenn of the class of ’79.”

 

EXCERPT FROM A LETTER FROM AN ALUMNUS

“Those who have not attended schools such as Washington
and Lee do not appreciate the value of the intangibles which
you mention. To preach integrity, dignity and a sense of the
continuity of man to a group of college men accomplishes
only a momentary glow of agreement. To live and work under
the influence of the University, its past and present, ingrains
those elements in any normally receptive student and gives
him a moral and philosophic stature above that which he
would otherwise possess. If anything which I can do will
help to ensure the continuance of such an institution, I am
only too glad to devote my efforts to such work. In addi-
tion, I have a selfish desire to preserve the spiritual and tra-
ditional values of Washington and Lee. I want my sons to
have an opportunity to study there.”

We wish to apologize for any errors in the class
notes appearing in this issue. The letters from which
these notes are taken were written, for the most part,
early last spring. The rapid influx of alumni into the
several branches of the armed forces of the United
States have no doubt rendered some of these notes
maccurate. We would like to have more material for
class notes in letters to your Class Agents this year.

and said it was all right to pay him. Dr. Osburn said “I was
about to leave and not pay as I could not find anyone.” The
janitor asked, “Did you ever go to Washington and Lee?
No boy who ever went to Washington and Lee would go off
without paying.” He remembered the “Honor System” and
was proud and touched by this confidence, and glad that he
had attended a college where it was in force.

James R. Caskie, member of the University Board of Trus-
tees, never gives us any news of himself from which.we can
write a class note, but is such a faithful and enthusiastic

National Bank Building, Lynchburg, Virginia.

Basil Manly is vice-chairman of the Federal Power Com-

the approval of power contracts to supply all war plants and
establishments for which the Federal Government assumes
any obligation. He also has general supervision of gas plants

Hugh Hawthorne, vice-president of the Pocahontas Fuel

Roger M. Winborne, Bernhardt Furniture Company, Le-
noir, North Carolina, is secretary of the Law Class of 1911,
and publisher of the very interesting 1943 edition of the Class
Annual. This publication has been issued annually for thirty

years and has been the means of making this the very best
class organization ever graduated from Washington and Lee.
The Alumni Office is a little jealous, however, because we
have to refer to the Annual for Class Notes, and get some of
our information second-hand. They keep up the alimony, but
the family relationship is not as close as it might be. Roger,
Jr., who attended Washington and Lee during last year, is
now in the army.

applicable.

Howard L. Robinson is a member of the law firm of Rob-
inson and Stump, Union National Bank Building, Clarks-
burg, West Virginia. He says: “Washington and Lee has
played a conspicuous part in our country’s history. Its dis-
tinct characteristics have made great contributions to the
American system through all its years. The young men who
have been graduated from it have taken much from the cam-
pus to their respective communities in which they have lived
and worked. We should bear in mind that we have received
more from Washington and Lee than a few years training
and a diploma evidencing success in a course of study. Wash-
ington and Lee deserves the support of every alumnus, par-
ticularly at this period of stress for all educational institu-
tions, in order that it may better serve others when the clouds
of war shall have been dissipated and we shall have again
returned to the peaceful pursuits of civilian enterprise.”

John G. Hutton is an attorney-at-law, Sheridan, Wyoming.

him through his appointment as one of the legal advisers of
the Selective Service Board and as the Special Assistant to
the Attorney General of the United States, as Hearing Offi-
cer throughout the State of Wyoming in conscientious ob-
jector cases under the Draft Act. Both of his children are

finds extremely interesting.

and its people in connection with the present conflict; and even
though you may not have taken the four-year French course,
I am confident that you had sufficient time under his in-
struction to know, admire and appreciate him.”

G. R. Shaw is chief engineer for the Harrison Plant, R.C.A.
Victor Division of Radio Corporation of America, Harrison,

Echol Spina Marshall, who has been with the Continental
Can Company, Inc., New York, has been transferred to the

his class agent does not give him a little more personal news,
and says: “That simple fact makes me feel that possibly
there is something to this matter of class letters, even though
each individual feels very loath to talk about himself.’ The
Alumni Office hopes other alumni will take this suggestion
to heart. He says he would consider it a privilege to enter-

tain any Washington and Lee service men who might be in
New York and has a quiet spot in the country nearby where
they might have needed rest. If those passing through New
York would call him—Phone Regent 4-8143—he would be
most glad to see them.

T. H. (Swede) Scovell says: “After battling the business
world for twenty years I have come to the conclusion that it
is all the ‘Hokum.’ The darned thing has made a complete
about face. Today, you make less and have more. What kind
of ‘monkey business’ is this? Anyway, it required forty years
for me to learn how to live. Today, I have a small business
with my wife and the ‘hired’ help doing most of the work.
I have an orange grove and farm, just large enough to make
living cheap and require little work. I have seven bird dogs,
three hounds, and a good fishing boat. The game grounds are
the best in the States. I spend most of my time deciding
where to hunt or fish the next day. ‘Rosy’ is going to have to
go some to upset my apple cart.

“T raised and educated a girl, Ann, and boy, William. Ann

who spends his summers in a fur coat and his winters in a
bathing suit.

(Notes written by Class Agent)

There are a number of Charleston, West Virginia, alumni
who are members of this class:

Boone Dawson has just been elected Mayor for his third
Consecutive four-year term. Cy Hall was recently elected
Judge of the county-wide Criminal Court. John Morrison
was made a State Senator at the same time. Kay Thomas be-
came a candidate for Attorney General of West Virginia last
spring, volunteered for the Air Corps, was nominated in the
primary in August, was accepted for the Air Corps in Sep-
tember, and was elected Attorney General in November. He
took the oath of office and was given a leave of absence and
continued as Captain in the Combat Intelligence Division of
the Air Corps, but it took a Supreme Court decision to de-
cide that he could be Attorney General at the same time.
He took part in the invasions of both Sicily and Italy, and
has been promoted from Captain to Major.

Stuart A. MacCorkle took a leave of absence two years ago
from the University of Texas for the purpose of serving a
few months as Visiting Educational Adviser to the National
Institute of Public Affairs, and when the war came on served
as Special Consultant to the Army Air Forces until placed in
the Office of Civilian Defense in Washington. It is note-
worthy that there is industry in Washington besides that of
Government. Frank Cole is a wholesaler and importer of
wines there with Magruder, Inc.

Bob Campbell, recently Rector of Episcopal churches at
Steubenville, Ohio, and Lorain, Ohio, is now Rector of the
second largest Episcopal Church in Cleveland, the Church of
the Incarnation. The Rector of the largest Episcopal Church
in Cleveland is Ted Evans, ’00 of Washington and Lee.

Thomas Coleman Green is a Colonel with the Corps of
ngineers of the Army. For his meritorious performance
during the Sicilian campaign, he was awarded the Legion of
Merit by order of General Eisenhower. The award stated:
“By his devotion to duty, courage, and foresight, he gave in-
valuable support to the continuous and successful advance
of the ... Corps.”

Otis Howe is still in the lumber business and also a farmer
on the side. He can almost organize an alumni association
within his family with his brother, Bobby Howe,’28, and
Jimmie Thomas, ’14, who married his sister, Otis and French
McKnight, ’23, having married sisters. His address is Wabash,
Arkansas.

Ran Whittle is practicing law in Roanoke, Virginia, with
offices in the Boxley Building.

Maurice Crocker is clerk and research assistant for the
Judge of the State’s most important court, the Circuit Court
in Charleston, West Virginia, in which litigation of state-
wide questions is initiated.

1925
(Notes written by Class Agent)

Vernon Kreienbaum, Emporia, Virginia, has turned his
lumber business to defense work, making boxes for airplane
motors, and guns which General Motors is manufacturing.
Vernon's boy, now 13, has his heart set on Washington and
Lee.

Herman Womeldorf, 211 East Campbell Street, is minister
of the South Frankfort Presbyterian Church, Frankfort,
Kentucky, where he has been serving since the first of De-
cember, 1942.

Dr. William L. Woolfolk, 2119 Frederica Street, Owens-
boro, Kentucky, is still an Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Spe-
cialist. It was my good pleasure to have a visit with Bill, his
wife and two children as they came through Jacksonville a
couple of months ago. Bill is no longer the slender fellow we
knew at Washington and Lee, but has rounded out into a
most respectable looking guy. That wavy hair he used to
have, waved goodbye to him.

Harry Dawson phoned me as he passed through Yulee, a
few miles from here. Sorry I couldn’t see you Harry, but it
was mighty thoughtful of you to phone. Harry can sleep a
few minutes later each morning now, for his office has been
moved five miles nearer his home. By the way, Harry’s ad-
dress is 6601 Exfair Road, Bethesda, Maryland.

Ed Rietze, 1714 Sulgrave Road, Louisville, Kentucky, liq-
uidated his business in September, 1942, because the Govern-
ment “Freezing Acts” were too much for his refrigerators.
But now Ed is in defense work as sales manager of the Abell
Elevator Company.

Tom Harmon, 1759 Commerce Building, Cleveland, Ohio,
writes his usual good letter. He is still practicing law, while
on the side, he and his three children have planted a nice
victory garden. Tom, mine is a rather hollow victory. When
my squash got ripe, you could buy them three pounds for 10c,
when the beans matured, they were 7c a pond, and now that
okra is coming along, it is 10c a pound. I still have tomatoes,
potatoes, butterbeans and collards. But it’s a lot of fun, even
if it doesn’t save money.

Murrell D. (Lefty) Klein, Starks Building, Louisville, has
been in the insurance business for seventeen years, likes it,
and also likes his lovely wife and two fine daughters. Murrell,
since you were our Class Historian, why not just take up the
task of bringing your Class History up to date if we have a
reunion in 1945?

Bo McMillan, Athens, Tennessee, is still in the Coal and
Transfer business. Bo is still a good quarterback, outwitting
his opponents. He recently celebrated his 39th birthday, in-
viting the entire Draft Board in for the party! I’m 39 today,
Bo, but for some reason that I don’t understand, they don’t
draft preachers at my age.

Bob Goodrich is back with the Franklin Limestone Com-
pany, 612 Tenth Avenue, Nashville, Tenessee, having been
discharged from the Army a few months ago. Bob has reached
that age where life begins, so maybe it is true in more ways
than one! Sorry I missed you as you came through Jack-
sonville, Bob.

Joe Holt, 206 Westminster Avenue, Merchantville, New
Jersey, is now in the law department of R.C.A., Camden,
New Jersey. He likes his new work, and reports that his
family is getting along fine.

Roy C. Slack, division manager of the Atlantic City Elec-
tric Company, Bridgeton, New Jersey, sends his best wishes
to all the fellows. Knowing Roy as we do, we congratulate
the Electric Company on its choice. Roy says there are a lot
of Washington and Lee boys in his vicinity, but most of them
are considerably younger, so in the service.

Wilson Roach, Denbigh Hall, Wilmington, Delaware, sent
his picture along to show that he hasn’t changed a bit (as-
suming that it’s a late picture). He is still general agent for
the Massachusetts Protective Association. Wilson says that
things move so rapidly there, “it’s a wonder I get any meals—
if it weren’t automatic, I’d probably starve to death.”

Conrad Altfather, Rankin Avenue, Basking Ridge, New
Jersey, is doing relay designing for the Westinghouse Elec-
tric and Manufacturing Company, Newark, New Jersey,
spending much of his time on designs destined directly for
combat duty. Bad news for Hitler!

Ken Goode, Box 6119, Cleveland, Ohio, writes that he is
busily engaged with the C. and O. Railway. He says he’s lost
the ten pounds he reported last year. Well, if the railroad
business there is anything to compare with what it is here
(and my guess it that it is worse), Ken is doing well not to
lose more.

Dr. J. J. Rives is now pastor of Centenary Methodist
Church, Richmond, Virginia, where he has served for the
past eight years. He is doing a great work with the Service
men of his city. His “two little girls are both married, and
each is the mother of a fine boy.” We well remember Dr.
Rives as minister at the Lexington Methodist Church, taking
his M.A. degree along with us.

Tom Lyle, 633 West 45th Avenue, Gary, Indiana, is still
district manager of Factory Stores, operating 25 restaurants
in the Chicago district, feeding workers in the steel mills.

Dr. H. S. Liebert is an Osteopathic physician, practicing
at 512 Methodist Publishing Building, Richmond, Virginia.
“Hank” has been “popping people’s bones” for 16 years,
and I’d like to be lying on his table right now; I think he
could do me some good. He is the father of three children.

James Spiers, General Delivery, Wilmington, North Caro-
lina, left the farm to become supervisor, operating a crane
in the construction of Liberty Ships. James, that’s a real job.
We have launched seven so far here, and I was present for
one launching. Those cranes are really something to talk
about.

Charlie Gaines, 1819 Willowbranch Terrace, Jacksonville,
is with the Eastport Marine Construction Company, where he
and his father are just now engaged in building 50 wooden oil
barges.

John McVay, 1945 Fifth Avenue, Huntington, West Vir-
ginia, after spending fifteen years in display advertising, de-
cided there was more “dough” in bakeries, so is now sales
manager for the E. W. Mootz Bakery.
