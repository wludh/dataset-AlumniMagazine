COVER AND FRONTISPIECE

(1) Cover—probably the most familiar scene on the campus

during the three-day Bicentennial alumni reunion was the cir-

culating of friends and classmates around the tented registra-

ion headquarters, erected in front of Doremus Gymnasium as

a clearing house for just simply “getting together,” which is
what everyone seemed to want to do.

(2) Frontispiece—The reception given by President and Mrs.
Francis P. Gaines at their campus home provided a splendid
medium for everyone to see everyone else. Originally planned
as a garden party, the affair was moved indoors when heavy
rains, which prevailed through most of the three-day Bicen-
tennial celebration, turned the grounds into a quagmire. If
anyone’s spirits were dampened by the weather, it was never
apparent. Some said they hadn’t noticed it was raining.

Bicentennial Reminiscences

(THE PRESIDENT’S PAGE)

Recalling the program of the Bicentennial Year, I
find my heart moved with deep gratitude to the alumni
who helped to make that year good, who came to the vari-
ous occasions and who wrote letters of encouragement.
The graciousness of response is the true reward for
everything we tried to do.

* OK KK

In this somewhat public but entirely informal way, I
ask to be allowed to express my thanks also to hundreds
of alumni who were unable to come to any of the func-
tions but sent assurances of interest.

* OK CK KOK

I don’t give away any secret, I am sure, when I ad-
mit that there was really a tremendous amount of work
done by way of preparation. We older officials, of course,
had the matter almost constantly in our thoughts. About
eight major faculty committees supervised various phases
—speakers, assemblies, degrees, local arrangements, and
the like. The marshals, under the skillful leadership of
Professor Light, took perfect care of every public oc-
casion. The journalism laboratory gave service of the
highest quality.

ak SS Be

Knowing full well that it is dangerous and probably
inaccurate for me to single out anybody at a time when
everybody was doing all possible, I shall still venture to
give this kind of citation to the group of young adminis-
trative assistants—Booth, Buchanan, Brady, Carmichael,
the Ravenhorsts (the Mr. and the Miss), Wilson, and
others. They worked with such efficiency and with such

unfailing cheerfulness and with such generosity of spirit
that just the fellowship with them has been an inspiration.
to us of the older generation.

* OK OK KK

The kindness and the competence of the faculty ladies
in their efforts to help is one of the abiding and radiant
memories in my own mind. Think, if you will, of Mrs.
Gaines trying to plan a lawn party for 3,000 and finding
the day drenched with steaming rain. The resourcefulness
of the ladies commanded that situation, I believe, about
as well as could have been done.

* OK OK OK OK

Many alumni have written me and more, I take it,
have written Mr. Young, suggesting that at least one
feature should be permanent, a kind of five-year plan
of reunion to be held always after the University has
closed, so that the returning alumni will have all the
University facilities and will be, as 1f to turn back the
clock, the only “students” on the campus.

* OOK OK KOK

The Bicentennial Year, I am convinced, was worth
all the effort. It did good for us in many ways, strengthen-
ing our central purpose, which is, of course, the training
of these fine young men. An unprecedented number of
distinguished speakers came, and numerous conferences
were held. The zeal of our boys in their quest for truth
was undoubtedly stimulated and given noble direction.
The best consequences of all, I should think, is that our
own alumni came into fuller understanding of our effort
and have made us feel their sympathy and their support.

The Bicentennial Alumni Reunion and
National Celebration

An estimated 1500 Washington and Lee alumni from all
over the United States and a number of foreign countries at-
tended the Bicentennial celebration, June 16-17-18. With
them they brought members of their families and friends that
swelled the crowd of visitors to about 2,000. All hotels in
Lexington and at Natural Bridge were filled for the occasion
and hundreds of the younger alumni were assigned to dormi-
tories and fraternity houses. Rain that came at intervals dur-
ing Thursday and Friday failed to upset the carrying out of
the plans or to dampen the enthusiasm of the guests.

A large circus tent was erected on the lawn in front of
Doremus Gymnasium to serve as headquarters and for regis-
tration. Here alumni received information as to assigned
quarters, badges admitting them to all scheduled events, etc.
Thursday evening an informal gathering and jamboree, with
refreshments, was held in the tent where alumni and their
Wives met with classmates and friends of college days. Music
for all the festivities was furnished by Darin O’Brien and
his orchestra.

registered to attend the reunion but was prevented from par-
ticipating by the death of his sister, Mrs. Henry Miller. The
oldest class with a representative present was 1887 with Dr.
Edward R. Leyburn, father of Dr. James G. Leyburn, Dean
of the University, of Atlanta, registering. The class of 1888
had Capt. Greenlee D. Letcher, Dr. E. P. Tompkins, of Lex-
ington, and Judge James FE. Quarles, of Staunton, Virginia.
Nearly every class since that date had members present,
Charles Curl, ’40, from Lima, Peru, and Herbert Dollahite,
32, of Honolulu, probably traveling the greatest distance to
be on hand. The 1939 and 1941 classes had the largest groups,
but 1924 also had a fine attendance observing its 25th anniver-
sary.

On Friday morning a service of thanksgiving and prayer
was held in Lee Chapel, conducted by Dr. John N. Thomas,
D.D., class of 1924, of Richmond, member of the University
Roard of ‘Trustees.

A highlight of the program was the alumni meeting in

Doremus gymnasium at 11 o’clock. Alumni were seated by
classes, indicated by large banners, and the floor of the gaily
decorated room resembled a convention hall. The number of
older alumni returning was surprising with classes about the
turn of the century well represented.

The General Alumni Meeting was followed by a barbe-
cue which was to have been held on the front campus to which
alumni were to have marched by classes. Rain interrupted
this procedure but the event was successfully held in the
large registration tent.

At 2:30 a transcription of the highlights of the Bicenten-
nial academic ceremonies on April 12th was played in Lee
Chapel. These events were recorded by the Journalism De-
partment on its electronic tape recorder.

From 5 to 6 p.m. all the visitors were entertained at a re-
ception at the home of President and Mrs. Gaines. In the
evening the alumni dance was led by Alumni Secretary H. K.
Young with Miss Mary Monroe Penick of Lexington and by

 

 

The Registration Desk was always busy. On the right: F. C. (Count) Barclay, ’28, Capt. G. D. Letcher, ’88 and C. P. Ander-

incoming Alumni president, Warren E. Tilson and Mrs. Til-

Celebration of the 200th birthday of the University was
concluded on Saturday, June 18th when, before the largest
assembly of alumni and friends in its history, it bestowed
honorary degrees upon ten men distinguished in politics, edu-
cation, medicine and the ministry. The principal speaker of
the occasion was former Secretary of State James F. Byrnes
of South Carolina, who was given the degree of doctor of laws.

Doremus Gymnasium, decorated with the Washington
end Lee colors and monogram shields, was filled beyond
Capacity, with many standing in the corridors and outside the
entrance doors. The rain which had plagued the alumni the
day before had ended and a bright summer sun shone on the
visitors and on the colorful academic procession from Wash-
ington Hall to the gymnasium.

Byrnes, once one of the most powerful New Dealers, took
the occasion to deliver a broadside at the present administra-
t-on policies. He advocated expenditures for foreign aid, but
criticized spending on all proposals pulling this country to-
ward statism. He stated that a sound economy is our gov-
crnment’s first line of defense.

He said “too many people are trying to transfer power to
the government.... We are not transferring too much power
from the individuals to the government, but we are transfer-
ring too many powers of state governments to the federal
government. We should not have the federal government
regimenting our lives from the cradle to the grave,” he stated.

“Where we will wind up, no one can tell,” he said, “but
if some of the new programs seriously proposed should be
adopted there is danger that the individual, whether farmer,
worker, manufacturer, lawyer, or doctor, soon will be an eco-
nomic slave pulling an oar in the galley of the state.”

Byrnes devoted most of his address to foreign affairs,
praising the firm stand taken toward Russia by the American
representatives at the Big Four conference in Paris.

He warned the Soviets that their present tactics might
lead to a rebirth of German militarism and that a revived
Germany might turn on Russia.

Other recipients of the Bicentennial honors were:

Doctor of Arts: Marion Montague Junkin, class of 1927,
Korean-born Southern artist, who has just resigned as head
of the department of fine arts at Vanderbilt University to ac-
cept a similar post at Washington and Lee in September.

Doctor of Letters: Thomas Joseph Sugrue, ’29, literary
critic and author of ‘Such Is the Kingdom,” “There Is a
River,” “Starling of the White House,” and “Stranger in the
Earth.”

Doctor of Science: Abner McGhee Harvey, °30, physician-
in-chief of Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, and profes-
sor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University.

Doctor of Divinity: Wiailliam Taliaferro
Union Theological Seminary, Richmond.

Doctors of Laws: Colgate Whitehead Darden, Ir., presi-
dent of the University of Virginia; Arthur Wilhamson Mc
Cain, °14, former president, now vice-chairman of the board,

As Byrnes was receiving the academic hood significant
of the LL.D. degree, his lifelong friend and fellow South
Carolinian, W. and L. President Francis P. Gaines, read an
accompanying citation:

“Of the multitude and magnificence of your contributions
to American life and the hope of the world, there is almost no
end; through manifold doors you entered the domain of pub-
lic life, alike for the moment of ultimate turbulence and for
tre hours of deep reflection, ever faithful, ever clear of mind,
ever clean of heart, lifted by your nobility of purpose high
above flattery, protected by your innate sweetness of soul
trom all bitterness; the history of your country will bear
vou enduring tribute.”

In the presentations of the candidates for degrees, Dean
James G. Leyburn departed occasionally from the usual
solemnity and his touches of humor brought delighted ap-
plause from the audience.

In humorous recognition of the present gubernatorial cam-
paign in Virginia, the gathering laughed heartily as Dean
Leyburn ended his brief review of Governor William M.
Tuck’s accomplishments with these words: ‘he has soared
with the ‘birds’ in his career as public servant of the state.”

Three of the recipients of the honorary degrees are claimed
by Lexington, Senator A. Willis Robertson, General Richard
Jacquelin Marshall, and Marion Montague Junkin.

Dr. Gaines’ citation as Senator Robertson received his
hood was as follows: “Vested by your people’s confidence
with great authority, you have interpreted every triumph in
political contest as a mandate for hard study, for honest
analysis of etfort in behalf of the highest cause; large privi-

leges that might have been translated into opportunism have
been decided by you to honorable and serviceable ends, and
you walk with conscience and dignity in the high places of
a people’s trust.”

Introduced by Dean Leyburn as “a warm friend and gen-
erous neighbor of the University,’ General Marshall was
cited by Dr. Gaines as follows: ‘To desperate councils of
war you gave wisdom and sweet gentleness of persuasion that
became a significant part of the chronicles of American des-
tiny; now to the engaging task of developing young minds
and the devotions of patriotic conviction you bring the same
deep understanding, the same winsomeness of guidance, with
utter fidelity alike to the luminous ideal and to the common-
place routine; and to your sister school you offer a friendli-
ness that increases the value of our work and the happiness
of our days.”

Of Marion Montague Junkin, Dr. Leyburn’s introduction
said: “son of Washington and Lee, scion of families more
than two-score of whose members have studied here and

served this community,” Dr. Gaines said: “master of pictorial

who was a recipient of the degree of doctor of divinity.

Minutes of
General Alumni Meeting

June 17, 1949, 11 a.m., Doremus Gymnasium

I. The meeting was called to order by Amos A. Bolen, ’34,
president of the Alumni Association. This Bicentennial Year
for the University also marked the 109th birthday of the
Alumni Association. The gymnasium was attractively deco-
rated for the occasion and the alumni were seated by classes.
Ladies were invited to attend the meeting and they watched
the proceedings from the balcony.

II. Dr. Gaines greeted the alumni. An impressive cere-
mony followed as he awarded to four retired professors cita-
tions and “affectionate greetings from their former students
in recognition of their collective service of 172 years of teach-

[ 10 |

ing young men. The honorees were James Lewis Howe, pro-
fessor emeritus of chemistry; Robert Henry Tucker, retired
dean of the University and former professor of economics;
Livingston Waddell Smith, professor emeritus of mathe-
matics; and Glover Dunn Hancock, whose retirement as dean
of the School of Commerce was announced last week.

IIf. Mr. Bolen introduced Christopher T. Chenery, ’09, of
New York, executive chairman of the national Bicentennial
organization, who presented to Dr. Gaines a scroll listing
names of donors to the Bicentennial fund campaign. En-
titled “Builders of a Third Century,” the scroll contains the
names of 3424 alumni and 787 other friends of the University
who have made gifts to the 200th anniversary fund (which
now totals $1,680,000.). Dr. Gaines in accepting the scroll
gave his thanks to all who made contributions.

IV. Highlighting the meeting was an address by Presi-
dent Gaines to the Washington and Lee men who came from
around the globe to celebrate their alma mater’s 200th birth-
day. The audience cheered when Dr. Gaines registered op-
position to federal aid to education in any form. He deplored
an attitude of “letting the federal government pay the bills
and letting the federal government have the control,’ and
warned that “the most dangerous of all is the concept of edu-
cation as a function of the federal government.” President
Gaines cited the House un-American Activities Committee’s
current inquiry into the selection of college textbooks as “an
example of what federal control can mean to education.” He
said he did not lack respect for Congress and that he com-
mended them for their efforts in handling political matters.
“But can you imagine, for example,” he asked, “a group of
erudite congressmen telling us what books our professors may
use in the teaching of our courses in comparative literature
and social anthropology?” In his closing remarks, Dr. Gaines
spoke of the devotion of George Washington to American
ideals and of the character of Robert E. Lee, loving justice
and appearing humbly before his God. He said that Wash-
ington and Lee acknowledges its heritage, even while it
dreams of its future.

V. Mr. Bolen said he spoke for all the alumni when he
acknowledged appreciation for the leadership and effort giv-
en by Milton B. Rogers, ’17, and L. J. Desha, ’06, in directing

 

Class signs dot the crowd at the general alumni
meeting in the gym.

 

the Bicentennial campaign. These men were introduced to the
assembled group and spoke briefly.

VI. Mr. Bolen introduced the new football coach, George
Barclay, who also spoke briefly to the alumni group.

VII. Marshal for the planned alumni parade by classes,
William M. Hinton, ’30, announced that the parade had to be
cancelled because of the weather. However, the barbecue
would follow the close of the meeting at 1 o’clock under the
tent in front of the gymnasium.

VIII. H. K. Young, Alumni Secretary, made the following
announcements:

1. Group pictures would be made after the meeting.

2. The new Boat House at Balcony Falls would be open
for inspection between 3:30 and 5:30 p.m. this afternoon.

3. There would be a meeting of all members of Pi Kappa
Phi fraternity at the chapter house at 3:00 p.m.

4. Alumni from “far away places” were requested to gather
for a group picture after the meeting.

XI. A call for new business brought forth the following:

1. A. Dawson Trundle, ’04, told of the design of the
Washington and Lee monogram by Thomas G. Stone, ’04,
and asked that proper recognition be made of this. It was de-
cided that the matter should be referred to the attention of
the Board.

2. W. J. L. Patton, ’22, asked that a rising vote of thanks
be given Roy J. Grimley, ’21, who made possible the issu-
ance of the Washington and Lee commemorative stamp. This
action was taken.

XII. Mr. Bolen, as president of Alumni, Inc., gave a
brief report of the year’s activities.

XIII. The meeting was closed with the singing of “The
Swing.”

 

The Bicentennial Finals

The Bicentennial Finals was inaugurated with the Bacca-
laureate sermon to graduates in Lee Chapel on Sunday, June
5, with the sermon by The Reverend John H. Buchanan,
Pastor, Southside Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama.

The interfraternity dance on Wednesday night, June 8,
was led by Paul J. B. Murphy, Jr., president of the Inter-
fraternity Council, with Miss Donna Davis, and the final ball,
on the night of June 9, by Finals President, Dale Johnson,
with Miss Evelyn Woods of Charlotte, North Carolina.

Preceding the Final ball, President and Mrs. Gaines were
hosts at a formal .reception at their home, honoring the
graduates and their out-of-town guests.

One of Washington and Lee’s oldest and most colorful
Finals Week traditions was renewed on Thursday afternoon
when the rival Harry Lee and Albert Sidney Boat Clubs
hauled out their eight-oared shells for a match race on the
James River at Balcony Falls, the Albert Sidneys winning
the race by a narrow margin.

The two W. and L. boating organizations, which included

 

 

Heading the Congressional delegation at the convocation
were Senator Leverett Saltonstall of Massachusetts and
Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas, who are shown here being
introduced to Washington and Lee men from
all over the world.

members of the varsity and freshman crews, have been com-

of a handsome old silver loving cup.

Two hundred and seventeen students received diplomas
Friday morning, June 10, at Washington and Lee’s Bicenten-
nial commencement at the hands of President Francis P.
Gaines. With the 55 who graduated during the year in the
accelerated program which is now at an end, the class of 1949
numbered 272, the largest ever to be turned out by the Uni-
versity.

Following the tradition of recent years by choice of the
students, Dr. Gaines himself made the address to graduates.
He told them that Americans were the healthiest, the richest
and the longest lived people in the world, but not the happiest.
Commingling as his rare gift permits him to do, the light
with the serious, Dr. Gaines pointed out that the only true
road to happiness was in self forgetfulness. That he said,
could be considered General Lee’s last message to his stu-
dents.

There are three principles to which all religions, he said,
could subscribe: first, that there is a God who is the supreme
creator; second, that God judges motives rather than actions;
and third, that a man must do for others rather than himself.

“Wise men pondered the detailed program of your de-
velopment,” he said, ‘and learned personalities, energized by
devotion to truth and to you, have poured through many
channels the accumulated riches of the human experience. _

“Validation of that faith is certain if the test be your at-
tainment in the power and the wealth, if the fruitage of that
investment is to be measured in terms of material comfort,
superficial complacency.

“But the whole project is a grotesque failure, if we have
not led you to understand that your real importance is that
you are a child of God, made in his image, responsible to Him;
that the privileges which make possible your triumphing
career are, as proolaimed by our Declaration of Independence,
not inherent rights selfishly to be claimed and enjoyed but
endowments of the Creator, bits of trusteeship for the infinite;
that the final responsibility and the final deserving of oppor-
tunity are fulfilled in cleanness of motive and in concern for
the less fortunate.

“In such an education alone is your chance for final hap-
piness, and in such education is the world’s only hope.”

Pnoto by Loeffler, Roanoke Times

Robert E. Lee, IV, becomes a “49’er,” a member of the Bi-

centennial graduating class as he receives his Bachelor of
Science degree from President Gaines.

 

Class valedictorian was Matthew W. Paxton, Jr., of Lex-
ington. He spoke of the Bicentennial era which had set his
class apart, and of the past war era now coming to a close.
Whereas over 1000 of the 1300 students in 1946-47 were vet-
erans, only 365 out of 1200 next year will have seen service in
the war, and only 165 of these will be undergraduates.

He spoke also of a new academic era which this class has
seen inaugurated under the guidance of Dean James G. Ley-
burn, with a broadening of the study of the humanities and
the institution of a new department of fine arts and more
elective courses. The Washington and Lee graduate, he said,
would not consider himself as finished with education, but
would go on after graduation to pursue the keen pleasure of
acquiring and using knowledge.

Among the graduates was Robert FE. Lee, IV, great grand-
son of General Robert E. Lee and son of Mrs. George Bolling
Lee and the late Dr. Lee of New York. As a combat infan-
tryman in World War II he was decorated for service in the
European theatre.

The exercises were held on the campus in front of Lee
Chapel where a natural amphitheatre is provided, shaded by
the overhanging trees. Here President Gaines announced the
honors and handed out the diplomas. The ceremony was
opened with the invocation by Dr. W. W. Morton and closed
with the singing of “College Friendships.”

 

DR. J. G. LEYBURN IS DECORATED BY
HAITIAN REPUBLIC

The rank of Officer of the National Order of Honor and
Merit has been bestowed on James G. Leyburn, dean of
Washington and Lee University, by the President of Haiti
in recognition of notable contributions to the Haitian Re-
public.

A citation and medal which accompany the award have
been received by Dr. Leyburn from the Haitian Ambassador
to the United States, Joseph D. Charles. The order represents
one of the highest honors that can be conferred upon a for-
eigner by the government of Haiti.

Dr. Leyburn’s association with Haiti has been largely in
the field of social studies. His book, ‘““The Haitian People,”

published in 1941, won the John Anisfield Memorial Prize for
the year’s best work in racial relations. He has served the
government and people of Haiti in varied capacities and is
currently on a committee of sponsors chosen by the Repub-
lic of Haiti for a prize essay contest on “The Contributions
of Haiti to the Independence of American Republics, 1776-
1826.”

 

IRWIN SANDERS, ’29, AUTHOR OF BOOK

Irwin T. Sanders, B.A., ’29, Phi Beta Kappa, is the author
of “Balkan Village,” published by the University of Ken-
tucky Press, Lexington, Kentucky, 1949. Dragalevtsy, the
Palkan Village described by Mr. Sanders, brings into focus
ihe struggle now in that country where an irresistable force
is meeting an immovable impaet. The bulk of the book de-
tails the ways of life of a tranquil rural folk clinging to a
Bulgarian mountainside, in the shadow of a twelfth century
monastry—their history, economic system, courtship and
inarriage customs, patriarchal family life, and reluctant yield-
ing to the ways of the western world. Then came the war,
the Nazi “New Order,” and defeat. On the morning of Sep-
tember 6, 1944, Dragalevtsy awoke to find posters in the
streets proclaiming “Welcome to the Heroic Red Army” and
“Long Live Stalin.”

Mr. Sanders, now Professor of Sociology at the Univer-
sity of Kentucky, writes with the authority of scholarship
and intimacy. From 1929 to 1932 and again in 1934 to 1937 he
taught in the American College of Sofia and made almost
daily trips to the nearby village. In 1945-1946 he was again
in the area as an Agricultural Attache representing the State
Department.

Mr. Sanders has sent a copy of “Balkan Village’ to the
Washington and Lee McCormick Library.

 

ALUMNI AT UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA

There are now five Washington and Lee Alumni teaching
at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida: Dr. Harry
M. Philpott, ’38, Professor of Religion; Dr. Freeman H. Hart,
"12, in the Humanities; Dr. Edward Lyons, ’12, Chemistry;
C. Arnold Matthews, ’37, Money and Banking; Philip K.
Yonge, IIT, 39, Law. Robert E. Lee, ’41, after teaching mathe-
matics for two years, is now taking work toward his Ph.D. in
the College of Education.

 

 

A service of Thanksgiving in Lee Chapel formally opened
the three-day program of Bicentennial celebration.

L. W. Adams Becomes Dean
of School of Commerce
and Administration

Lewis Whitaker Adams, professor of economics, has been
elevated to the post of dean of the Washington and Lee
School of Commerce and Administration, effective at the
beginning of the University’s 20lst term in September. He
succeeds Dr. Glover Dunn Hancock, who has served without
interruption since 1919.

Dr. Adams is a graduate of the University of North Caro-
lina, class of 1925, and received his Ph.D. degree from Corn-
ell University, where he also spent two years on the faculty.
He had been a meinber of the Washington and Lee staff as
an instructor in economics from 1926 until 1929, when he
entered the investment securities business in New York as an

The Alumni Magazine, Washington and Lee University

associate of Wall
Street broker Earle T.
Holsopple. He re-
turned to Washington
and Lee in 1940 to
teach economics.

During World War
II, Dr. Adams served
as a lieutenant-com-
mander in the Navy.
His wartime activities
included duty as ad-
ministrative officer of
the Naval ‘Training
Schools, Harvard Uni-
versity, and later as
executive officer of the
Navy College Training
Program in the office
of the Chief of Naval
Personnel, Washing-

ton, D.C.

Declining a govern-
ment proposal that he contiue as civilian director of the Navy’s
postwar NROTC program, he returned to Lexington to re-
sume his work on the Washington and Lee commerce school
staff.

In his announcement that the vacated post had been
filled, President Gaines said, ‘““My advisers join me in feel-
ing that to this important task Dr. Adams brings adequate
experience, scholarship, administrative ability and character.
The university is particularly fortunate that, in spite of his
business success and subsequent proposals that he remain
in the naval service as its chief educational administrator after
the war, he preferred to return to active teaching.”

Born in Andrews, North Carolina, in 1904, Dr. Adams is
married to the former May Davidson, of Lexington, and
they have two children. He is a member of Omicron Delta
Kappa, national honorary leadership fraternity, Phi Kappa
Sigma, social fraternity, and Alpha Kappa Psi, honorary
commerce fraternity.
