One of the many advantages of
being associated with an academic in-
s¢itution is that everything starts afresh
‘») the fall. An unknown group of faces
fils the classroom and the freshman
dorms; new teachers join the ranks of
-he faculty; and the bookstore is burst-
‘ng with clean textbooks and notepads.

The cycle begins again this way
every fall, both at W&L and at all col-
leges and universities. But this year, the
fall seemed even more exciting than
usual. Six fraternities were undergoing
extensive renovations; the Lenfest
Center for the Performing Arts was
nearing completion; and work had
begun on a new wing at Lewis Hall.

Physical transformations are always
che most visible changes that occur at
an institution. But other innovations are
taking place at Washington and Lee, as
well. In an article titled “Toward the
2 ist Century,” which begins on page 3
of this magazine, President Wilson de-
scribes some of the ambitious plans that
have been formulated for the University
as it approaches the new millennium.

Another change occurred at Wash-
ington and Lee in October, when the
Board of Trustees elected a new rector.
In this issue of W@L, A. Stevens Miles,
‘51, offers some of his thoughts about
the University, its future, and his role
as rector of the Board.

Among the recommendations of
Washington and Lee’s long-range plan
are several that involve foreign study
and travel. Already, members of the
University community recognize the im-
portance of international awareness, and
this issue of W@L contains the stories
of four separate trips, made by W&L
students or professors, to different parts
of the world.

One W&L alumnus in particular
believes it is absolutely critical for to-
day’s students to learn about different
peoples and cultures. J. Carter Fox, ’61,
president, CEO, and director of
Chesapeake Corp. in Richmond, offers
advice to undergraduates and aspiring
business leaders in an article that begins
On page St.

An essential factor in supporting any
new initiatives—now and in the
future—is Washington and Lee’s en-
dowment. A story that begins on page
S explains the endowment and its
Significance. It is, indeed, “The Univer-
sity’s Foundation.”

Toward the
st Century

by President John D. Wilson

W&L

During the 1988-89 academic
year, the entire Washington and
Lee community engaged in a long-
range study of the institution. The
project was done with two purposes
in mind: to create a plan to ad-
dress the needs of the University as
it moves into the 21st century, and
to satisfy the self-study requirements
demanded by the regular accredita-
tion practices of the Southern
Association of Colleges and
Universities.

The yearlong process involved
virtually every member of the facul-
ty and administration in a compre-
hensive examination of the Universt-
ty. Subcommittees focused on such
diverse topics as the quality of the
undergraduate faculty and student
body, academic programs, the law
school, administrative services, and
the physical plant.

The subcommittees’ work was
compiled in a 292-page report
written and edited by Robert W.
McAhren, professor of history. The
report will now serve as the blue-
print for institutional planning as
Washington and Lee prepares to
meet the changing environment of
the 1990s and the 21st century.

In the following essay, President
John D. Wilson examines the
University in its present state and
addresses the issues it will face im
the immediate and distant future.

VV cue and Lee University is, by any
reckoning, an old and honorable institution of
higher learning. To have reached the decade in
which our 250th birthday will be celebrated (1999)
is no small feat. And, with due allowance for in-
evitable ups and downs, the University has made
steady progress over these centuries, progress that
continues to this very day. We owe it to our
founders and to posterity to do everything in
our power to ensure a strengthened Washington
and Lee for the next century.

The recently completed long-range study makes
it clear that this will not be easy. The college-
going population will continue to contract for
another few years, and competition for the most
promising students will sharpen. Equally competi-
tive will be the search for promising new faculty,
for most colleges are now facing accelerating retire-
ment rates and there are fewer and fewer academ-
ically qualified candidates for teaching positions.
Finally, we face an uncertain decade of economic
fluctuations, with predictions of stagflation con-
founding our sense of what will be required of us.
And so, it will not be easy.

But it has never been easy. Washington and
Lee has grown in effectiveness and prominence on
its fidelity to high standards of achievement and
personal conduct and upon the success of its prom-
inent alumni-leaders across the nation. Washington
and Lee stands for honor and integrity, for aca-
demic excellence, for historically significant archi-
tecture, for the fidelity of its graduates and the
esteem of its peers. These are qualities we will not
easily surrender, and they will see us through diffi-
cult times.

As we look out across this decade and the first
years of the new century, both old and new chal-
lenges confront us.

FIRST OF ALL, we must be certain to maintain
the intimacy of our academic and social environ-
ment. Large classes are anonymous classes. Par-
ticipation falls as numbers increase, and that often
means that preparation and expectations fall as
well. Passive, unprepared students fill the large lec-
ture halls of America’s huge universities. We will
have no greater obligation than to ensure that we
keep our classes small so that serious writing can

 

be a part of every class and oral argument as well.
Relationships of a lasting kind are created in an
environment kept to human scale. We must pledge
ourselves to limit our enrollments and keep our
ratio of students to faculty as rich as we can make
it. In short, we must never fail to take seriously
the teaching of young men and women in the
liberal arts and sciences and in the law.

SECONDLY, we must confront the problem of
our faculty retirement schedule with renewed vigor.
In this current academic year alone, we are losing
seven superior scholar/teachers— Westbrook

Barritt in Spanish, Jay Cook in accounting,

Sidney Coulling in English, Milton Colvin in
politics, Henry Sharp in mathematics, Steve
Stephenson in German, and Clark Mollenhoff in
journalism. Together these men have taught at
Washington and Lee for 220 years and with irre-
placeable verve. The best we can do is reach out
with attractive compensation programs to attract
the most promising young scholars in this country,
scholars who have the potential to grow to the
stature of our retiring giants and who will readily
subscribe to the University’s values and priorities.

THIRDLY, we must do everything we can to en-
sure that tomorrow's Washington and Lee students
bring to Lexington more than academic talent. We
have become accustomed to a rich supply of young
people of ambition, young people who want to
make a difference in their world, young people
who have an instinct for leadership and who are
willing to devote their energies and talents toward
the improvement of their communities. As the
demographic curve continues downward, the com-
petition for these talented students will intensify,
and we must be sure that our scholarship endow-
ment is strong enough to sustain our “fair share.”

A major new theme in the long-range report
is centered upon international studies. It is com-
monplace to observe that our world is growing
smaller and the bonds of interdependence are
rapidly expanding. To a University like ours this

W&L

W&L

means many things—
from formal courses
in area studies, to
new and sophisti-
cated ways of teach-
ing foreign languages.
It also means more
travel abroad for
both students and
faculty, more formal
exchange programs,
more library mate-
rials from European
and Asian sources. In
brief, we have con-
cluded that every
isolationist tendency
in our intellectual
life will have to be
set aside if we are to continue to excel in the

new century.

When all is said and done, a university’s
strength is directly traceable to its foundation.
The permanent endowment of Washington and
Lee is that foundation. It had a market value of
just over $100 million at the end of the 1989-90
fiscal year. It is that endowment that provides for
the fundamentals here: for the purchase of sophis-
ticated scientific equipment, for the law library
subscriptions to key periodicals, for monograph
acquisitions in both libraries, for faculty salaries
and support funds, for the rapidly expanding pro-
grams and equipment of our Computer Center, for
the maintenance of our historic landmark campus,
for financial aid for students who cannot afford the
entire costs of residential study here.

A private university of distinction is impossible
to imagine without a strong endowment foundation.
Ours is strong, but it must be stronger still. The
national liberal arts community in which our under-
graduate programs compete and the national law
schools are much more amply endowed than are
we. In fact, our endowment is not half the size of
the endowments of Amherst, Smith, Swarthmore,
Williams, Pomona, Grinnell, or Wellesley. We can-
not amend that comparative disadvantage in a
single stroke or even in a few years. But we can

 

begin in earnest, and with good management and
continuing alumni loyalty we can hope to achieve
parity of endowment strength with our peers within
the foreseeable future. In any event, it is a chal-
lenge we cannot fail to take up and with conviction
and tenacity.

The faculty and staff who prepared the long-
range report for the Board of ‘Trustees are unani-
mous in praise of the physical environment in
which our work goes forward. Thanks to enlight-
ened leadership in the ’70s, the historic Colonnade
buildings, those graceful testaments to the taste of
earlier times, were entirely restored. Equally com-
pelling additions to the physical plant were also
made—the beautiful and functional home for the
School of Law (Lewis Hall), the University Li-
brary, and the Warner Center. In more recent
years Gaines Hall was added to help house upper-
division students and, now nearing completion, the
Lenfest Center for the Performing Arts was under-
taken, a magnificent new home for theatre, music,
and the visual arts. These new facilities have been
accompanied by small but significant renovations
and improvements, from new playing fields to a
stadium face-lift and a refurbished farmhouse-home
for the Archaeology Laboratory (next to the Liber-
ty Hall ruins).

This is a wonderful legacy and prepares us
well for the years just ahead. There are, however,
three remaining physical projects that demand
our attention:

(a) The University urgently requires a
deep renovation and extension of its scien-
tific buildings, Parmly and Howe. Neither
has been physically modulated in the past
30 years and science, over that time, has
continued to change and exert new pres-
sures. Air-handling requirements, student
laboratory stations, departmental library
consolidation, and new quarters for impor-
tant work in biochemistry, neuroscience,
and molecular biology all argue for a top
priority for a scientific facility upgrade.

(b) A new student center has also been
strongly recommended to the Trustees, a
building which can provide fully for the

bookstore and the luncheon and snack-
bar facilities now housed in the crowded
Co-op. We would add as well more spaces
for student organizations, for student
meetings, for an on-campus postal service,
and for quiet conversation between stu-
dents and among students and faculty.

Half of Washington and Lee’s student
body lives in off-campus apartments and
rented houses. These “commuter” students
drive in every day for their classes and for
extracurricular activities. But they have no
true home on campus, no place to un-
wind, to park their books and papers, to
take a coffee break during an evening of
library or computer laboratory study time.
A new student center designed to serve
these needs would, we think, continue the
best of both worlds and would check the
centrifugal forces that now seem to scatter
our students across the city and the coun-
ty at day’s end.

(c) Finally, the University faces the
challenge of elevating the quality of frater-
nity life. Inherited from many years of
decline, today’s Greek houses are an em-
barrassment to students and faculty alike.
Alumni who return to their old houses are
shocked and saddened by the physical
deterioration of once-majestic “homes.”
These houses must be dramatically im-
proved and they must be advanced as
closely as possible as a system so that Rush
advantages are not accidentally conferred.
We cannot insist upon the highest stan-
dards of academic work and personal con-
duct and yet continue to tolerate squalor
and unsafe conditions in the houses.

The Renaissance Program carries the
promise of a genuine reform movement,
desired by all constituencies in the Univer-
sity. No single act we perform in the next
dozen years will more conspicuously elevate
campus life than the revitalization and
qualitative improvement of our Greek
organizations.

 

< gas are but the main features of the long-
range plan the Trustees have recently adopted. It
is an ambitious, aggressive plan, unapologetic in its
assertion that this extraordinary institution, situated
in the loveliest valley in the world, will achieve
genuine greatness in our time. It is, as we know, a
unique institution, Southern in style and manner,
national in scope, distinctive in its insistence upon
inherited values of proven worth. It is, truly, a
priceless national asset, and it wi// be preserved for
our children and theirs to enjoy and profit from.

 

 

FROM MARX
TO FREE MARKETS

How does a nation which has been ruled by Com-
munist ideology for years suddenly adopt Western-
style capitalism?

It’s not an easy task, says Lyman Johnson, associate
professor of law at Washington and Lee. But for two
weeks last summer, he tried to make the transition a
bit smoother.

Johnson was one of 30 corporate
and securities law professionals chosen
to travel to Europe and meet with
their counterparts in Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Their
trip was sponsored by the Citizen Am-
bassador Program of People to Peo-
ple International, which was organized
during the Eisenhower administration
to promote international contact be-
tween ordinary citizens rather than
government employees.

During their visit, Johnson and his
fellow delegates coped with such
questions as: How should the law en-
courage and protect private invest-

 

 

ment? Who should regulate stock ex-
changes? And how can the government attract foreign
and domestic investors?

Although these’ governments need foreign capital,
they are afraid of too much foreign ownership, Johnson
says. In Czechoslovakia, officials are considering a sys-
tem where 20 percent of a company’s stock goes to the
public in the form of vouchers. Poland, though, wants
to keep large blocks of stock in the workers’ hands.

“One of the major problems facing these govern-
ments is exactly how to dispose of stock as state-
owned enterprises are being incorporated,” Johnson
explains. “Do you sell most of your stock to the do-
mestic population, or do you sell to foreign investors?”

As they go about transforming their political and
economic systems, all three nations face daunting
obstacles. Hungary and Poland have massive foreign
debts. The currency in the three countries is not con-
vertible in the international market. Plants and equip-
ment are obsolete; there is no real professional mana-
gerial class; and the environment is in real danger.

During his visit, Johnson sensed some nervousness
about the move toward political pluralism. “There has
been no real dialogue for 45 years,” he says. “The peo-
ple who remember the way things were before 1948
are elderly or retired. There is a whole generation who
knew nothing but the state-controlled economy.”

Still, the governments are receptive to foreign capi-
tal and eager for new ventures and
business opportunities. They are
currently reforming their legal sys-
tems to attract foreign investment. ]

“Legal reform is really not con-
troversial at all,” Johnson says.

“They recognize the need for a
legal system that covers securities
law, corporate law, and foreign
joint ventures. What is controver-
sial is the speed with which these
changes are going to occur.”

The Europeans were surprised,

Johnson says, at the extent of the
American regulatory system.
“We're not quite the wide-open
capitalist cowboys that they ex-
pected,” he explains. “Regulation does play a significant
role in the open market system.”

In the short term, Johnson predicts, the standard
of living will decline in the three nations he visited,
partly because previously underpriced consumer goods
will rise to market levels many citizens won't be able
to afford.

The result may be political discontent, but Johnson
thinks after the initial shocks the central European na- 5
tions will have certain advantages, such as a cheap 7
labor supply. Eventually, he predicts, the region will
have an open market economy characteristic of western
Europe, combined with some of the social “safety nets”
common in Scandinavian countries.

Despite its problems, Johnson is optimistic about
the future for central Europe. “The people in these
countries have the spirit and will to surmount tremen-
dous obstacles. Outsiders may bring in help and advice,
but these people will realize their economic and social
objectives all on their own.”

HEALING THE WOUNDS
IN VIETNAM

Lyn F. Wheeler, associate professor of accounting
at Washington and Lee, and his wife, Carol, had
always wanted to visit Vietnam.

During college, they watched the events of the
Vietnam War. And after graduation, during the height
of the conflict, they served as U.S. foreign service dip-
lomats in Holland, Germany, and Washington, D.C.
Still, their travels never took them to Vietnam.

“We felt a sadness about Vietnam and American
relations over the years and had a strong desire to do
something for that country,” Lyn Wheeler explains.

But last spring, their dream came true—for a short
time, anyway. During a sabbatical leave from W&L,
Lyn Wheeler arranged to teach accounting and market-
ing in Vietnam. He was sponsored by the Technology
and Economic Development Co. (TEDCO), a Vietna-
mese government organization that offers educational
seminars to Vietnamese executives.

His wife, meantime, was invited to teach English to
the Vietnamese executives. She was the first native
English-speaker allowed to give English classes in South
Vietnam since the collapse of the South Vietnamese
regime in 1975.

Last April 28, they arrived in Ho Chi Minh City
(formerly Saigon). They and their two children—Kevin,
12, and Mark, 9—were to stay until October.

Their visit began well
enough, Carol Wheeler
recalls. “At first we were
treated like celebrities. Our
personal contact with the
Vietnamese people was
warm and cordial. They
were delighted to have
Americans living and work-
ing in their country again.”

But Communist officials
were less receptive. As
political tension in the
South increased in May,
the Wheelers found they
were being indirectly harassed, sequestered from casual
contact with Vietnamese citizens, and cautioned about
what they could say to their students.

 

“We were told not to speak to the Vietnamese
people without permission from TEDCO,” Lyn
Wheeler récalls. “Our children were not allowed
to attend the local schools or to have a Vietnamese
tutor, and we were not allowed to leave Saigon without
permission. There were government informers in our
classrooms, and the political climate became increasing-
ly uncomfortable.”

His wife adds, “There are still serious cultural and
political differences between Northerners and Souther-
ners that have not been overcome since unification.
While we were there, officials stopped giving visas to
Americans, and some Americans were deported.”

After nine weeks, the couple decided to leave for
the sake of their children. “If we had been picked up
and detained, the children would have been left alone
in our house in the complex,” says Carol Wheeler.
“That was not a chance we were willing to take.”

Despite the short duration of their stay, the entire
family was grateful for the experience. It was particular-
ly helpful, the Wheelers say, for their children to see
how others live.

“The dire economic and social problems are very
evident—streets filled with unemployed men, inade-
quate sewer systems, overcrowded housing, and shor-
tages of electricity are just a few of the problems,” ex-

plains Carol Wheeler.

 

 

“It's no surprise that
5,000 Vietnamese
people—former in-
mates of the reedu-
cation camps—are
coming to the U.S.
each month. There is
no future for them or
their children.”

Although their trip
left them with mixed
feelings, Carol Wheeler
says, they would still like
to return someday.

“It was a great experience, and we feel that in-
dividual Americans have much they can contribute to
the Vietnamese.”

century, loved to talk about debt.

On frequent occasions, Gaines would
remind W&L students that George
Washington helped to pay for their educa-
tion. Washington made his gift—of 100
shares of James River Co. stock—in
1796. It was the first large gift of
securities to a college in the United
States, and it was the largest gift of any
kind that tiny Liberty Hall Academy had
received at that time.

As every W&L student learns,
Washington explained his act of philan-
thropy with the words, “Io promote
literature in this rising empire, and to en-
courage the arts, have ever been amongst
the warmest wishes of my heart.”

Washington’s gift continues to promote
literature, the arts, and

The term endowment refers to a pool of
invested funds. Annually, the Board of
Trustees spends a predetermined portion
of the endowment for the operating budget.
The amount withdrawn is less than the en-
dowment’s total return (dividends, interest,
and appreciation); hence the endowment

Endowment is the most

important factor for Washington

and Lee to move forward.

continues to grow, even though a portion
is spent every year.

As of June 30, 1990, the market value
of Washington and Lee’s endowment and
related funds was about $109.5 million—

$10,850—even though the actual cost of
educating each student is roughly $15,000.
Many peer institutions charge significantly
more. It’s not surprising that for the second
year in a row, U.S. News © World Report
has named Washington and Lee one of the
“best buys” among national liberal
arts colleges.

“Our endowment helps us to keep
tuition at a more competitive level,”
Broomall explains. “It gives us an edge
in the market.”

But what exactly do the endowment
dollars pay for? Three of the most im-
portant areas of expenditure, Broomall

says, are financial aid, student scholarships,
and faculty salaries.

Washington and Lee is one of a hand-
ful of private schools in the country that
maintain a separate budget for financial aid.

“Most places have an in-

 

other areas of knowledge.
In the past two centuries, it
has generated income Ae
amounting to 10 times its
original value, and each
year it pays a few dollars of
each student's tuition.

How can money given
200 years ago be of such
_ value today? The answer is
simple: endowment.

Gifts made to Wash-
ington and Lee fall into two
broad categories—annual
and capital. Each year, the
Annual Fund contributes
more than $2 million to

flated tuition charge to
cover a substantial portion
of financial aid,” Broomall
explains. “They are able to
subtract amounts from the
wealthiest students to help
pay the costs of the
neediest students. In other
words, the wealthiest
students subsidize the
financial-aid program.

“At Washington and
Lee, we believe tuition and
the financial-aid budget
should be kept separate.”

Financial aid refers to
grants, loans, and work-

 

 

help pay heating bills, boost

faculty salaries, and buy new books for the
undergraduate and law libraries. Other
unrestricted gifts also support the operating
budget.

Capital gifts, on the other hand, become
permanent assets of the University. Some
of those funds are spent on construction and
improvements to the campus. (A recent ex-
ample is the $3 ‘million contributed by
Marguerite and Gerry Lenfest, ’53, to build
the Lenfest Center for the Performing
Arts.) Other capital gifts become part of
Washington and Lee’s endowment.

8 W&L

nearly $54,000 for every student. Revenues
from the endowment will contribute more
than $6 million to the University’s overall
budget in 1990-91.

The importance of the endowment can-
not be overstated, says University treasurer
Larry Broomall. “This year, dividends from
the endowment will pay nearly 10 percent
of our total budget,” Broomall explains.

The single largest benefit of the endow-
ment, Broomall says, is that it helps
Washington and Lee to keep its tuition low.
In 1990-91, for instance, W&L's tuition is

study payments made to
students who cannot afford the full cost of
a Washington and Lee education. But the
University also makes grants to students
based not on need, but on their academic
and personal achievements. These
grants—which are supported by
endowment—are called honor scholarships.
Each year, hundreds of prospective
students compete for the scholarships;
which pay part or all of the cost of tuition.
Many of these students visit Lexington for
a weekend, meet with faculty and current
undergraduates, and tour the campus.

 

“Honor scholarships allow us to
attract some of the strongest
students in the nation,” Broomall
says. “They help make the
classroom a more vibrant place.”

The scholarships are awarded
on the basis of the students’
academic record, evaluations by
high school teachers and guidance
counselors, and the record of
achievement and leadership in ex-
tracurricular activities.

Many of the honor scholarships
are named for specific individuals
who have endowed them. They in-
clude the Dora L. Lewis, Best
Products Foundation, Kent Frazier,
Keelty, Philip Morris, Darnall W.
Boyd Jr., A. B., Dolly, and Ralph
Cohen, and William C. Dyer
scholarships. In addition, four
alumni chapters— Baltimore,
Houston, Mid-South, and Florida
West Coast—have endowed
scholarships for students from
those areas.

“All colleges and universities in
the country are now facing a declin-
ing number of students in the ap-
plicant pool,” says John W. Elrod,

 

 

to recruit the sort of student we
want to have at W&L.”

Demographics are a concern
not only in the undergraduate divi-
sions, but in the School of Law as
well. “We face a much more com-
petitive environment today than we
did 10 or 20 years ago,” explains
Susan Palmer, ’85L, assistant dean
of the School. “Law schools have
to work harder than ever to attract
the most capable students.”

And because many law students
are saddled with debt from their
undergraduate years, fewer of them
are willing to take out additional
loans to pay for law school. “If they
do borrow money for law school,
they find their employment oppor-
tunities are much more restricted
when they graduate,” Palmer adds.

“They simply can’t afford to
work in a small-town practice or in
public-service law, because they
aren't able to pay off their student
loans. It’s important for us to lessen
the amount of debt they incur by
awarding scholarships, and not
making students rely on loans.”

Attracting fine students—to

 

 

dean of the College and vice presi-

dent for academic affairs. “Ihe most
talented, well-rounded students that we
want at Washington and Lee are being
recruited vigorously at other places, and the
honor scholarships
help us attract them
to W&L.”

The honor schol-
arship program is a
powerful marketing
tool for admissions—
even when students
don’t actually receive
an award. In this
year’s freshman class,
for example, nearly
half of the students applied for an honor
scholarship. Only three percent of them ac-
tually won a cash award, but the scholar-
ship competition brought many others to
the campus and convinced them to enroll.

“The young people who apply for honor
scholarships are the most promising can-
didates in the pool,” explains William M.
Hartog, dean of admissions and financial

 

aid. “It’s the honor scholarship program
that enables us to enroll them in signifi-
cant numbers.

“As the demographic trend continues,
we need to have more of these scholarships

both the undergraduate and law
divisions—is one formidable challenge the
University will encounter in coming years.
Another equally pressing task, which can be
greatly assisted by a larger endowment, in-
volves the faculty.
Between 1990
and 2005, Elrod says,
50 current members
of the faculty will
reach the ages of
65-70. “Even though
the mandatory retire-
ment age of 70 is ex-
pected to be lifted for
college faculty in
1994, we anticipate
that a significant number of these 50 will
retire during the next 15-year period,” he
says. Too, the University expects to add
five new faculty positions to lower the
student-teacher ratio. It’s inevitable, then,

W&L 9

 

that W&L will need to hire a very
high number of new faculty
members in the next decade.

“The University faces no
greater challenge than this one,”
Elrod says. “We must find faculty
who have the right academic
values; who really want to teach
and at the same time are commit-
ted to their fields.”

One factor that can help attract
new faculty, Elrod says, is the
availability of endowed professorships.
Washington and Lee currently of-
fers 13 such professorships, and in
coming years it hopes to add eight
more in the College and five in the
School of Law.

Endowed professorships help
meet faculty salaries and provide
faculty members with some discre-
tionary funding which is used to ad-
vance their teaching and scholar-
ship. The funds may help them
travel to scholarly meetings, per-
form research in the summertime,
or buy needed pieces of equipment.

“The recipients of endowed
professorships are chosen because
they are exemplars of the teacher-

 

 

 

For the past several years,
every 25th and 50th reunion class
has created a named endowment to
celebrate its anniversary and assist
Washington and Lee.

Eventually, the University
hopes to have an endowment fund
for every academic department and
for the School of Law.

In 1960, Dr. Gustavus Benz
Capito—a member of W&L’s class
of 1899—endowed the Robert E.
Lee Research Program. In the 30
years since its creation, the pro-
gram has helped to fund more than
1,000 original research projects in-
volving both faculty and students,

Originally, the research projects
took place only during the
academic months, and students
were paid a small hourly wage for
their work. But the program has ex-
panded in recent years, and now a
small number of undergraduates
participate in the summer as well.
They perform research full time,
and they receive room and board
in addition to the hourly stipend.

Naturally, this expansion has
put a financial burden on the pro-

 

 

scholar ideal,” Elrod says. “They
embody the success and accomplishment
that we hope for all our faculty.”
Sometimes, Elrod says, endowed pro-
fessorships are used to attract outstanding
faculty from other
colleges and univer-
sities. On other occa-
sions, he explains,
they provide a way
for the University to
“reward long-stand-
ing and particularly
achieving members
of our own faculty.”
He adds, “This is
a legitimate way of
recognizing distinction among one’s own.”
In addition to financial aid, scholarships,
and professorships, the endowment sup-
ports many other aspects of academic life
at Washington and Lee. For instance,

10 W&L

several academic departments have their
own endowments which pay for special
teaching and research needs. The Philip
Fullerton Howerton Fund—named for a 1925

 

 

graduate—allows the department of religion
to bring in guest speakers and lecturers.
The geology department is able to purchase
sophisticated equipment thanks to the
Frank G. Young, 66, Endowment.

 

gram’s endowment, and additional
invested funds will be needed if the program

continues to grow.

Of course, research projects cannot
occur at all—particularly in the
sciences— without
the right equipment.
But again, equipment
is extraordinarily
expensive.

“I’s not unusual
for a department in
the sciences to spend
$60,000 or $70,000
on a single piece of
equipment,” Elrod
explains. “And these
things aren't luxury items—you simply
can’t do college science without the
proper equipment.”

In the near future, Washington and Lee
hopes to create a separate endowment ©

 

 

support acquisitions of scientific
equipment.

Just as critical is the need to
bolster W&L’s computer facilities
and the University and law libraries.
“The libraries easily require five
percent of our annual operating
budget, and the Computer Center
requires nearly that much,” Elrod
says. “These are the major cost
centers that are driving up our
budget and keeping it ahead of the
inflation rate.”

Nonetheless, these are two of
the most critical areas of the
University. Education has become
dependent on computers, Elrod
says, and “the library is the heart
of the University.” Endowment
funds are needed to sustain both
areas and to remove some pressure
from the operating budget.

Too, Washington and Lee
needs endowment funds to support
faculty scholarship and research ac-
tivities. “Our faculty spend Sep-
tember through May in the
classroom,” Elrod says. “Only in
the summer or during sabbatical
leaves are they able to devote any

 

 

the faculty and administration con-
tend it is absolutely essential for the
University to continue its progress
into the 21st century.

“Endowment is the most impor-
tant factor for Washington and Lee
to move forward in the areas of
teaching and student services,”
Elrod explains. “Tuition permits us
to do nothing more than stand still.

“The endowment is our finan-
cial bedrock.”

Since it is so important, the en-
dowment is carefully maintained.
Broomall, the University treasurer,
and the investment committee of
the Board of Trustees oversee its
growth; W&L also employs a pro-
fessional money-management firm
which invests the funds. The
Board’s committee provides
guidelines to the firm and monitors
its performance.

“In October 1987, when the
stock market dropped 20 to 25 per-
cent,” Broomall says, “our endow-
ment value dropped only about
eight percent.” The firm that W&L
employs, he adds, “tries to protect
us against bad markets and take ad-

 

 

time to their professional and
scholarly development.

“Their first obligation, obviously, is
teaching. But it’s important that they stay
current in their fields and build a founda-
tion they can draw on

leaders to campus to meet individually with
students in and out of the classroom. Funds
are also being sought to bolster the work
of the Frances Lewis Law Center and the

 

in the classroom.”
The University
hopes to create an
endowment fund to
Support faculty re-
search, scholarship,
and travel in all three
of the University’s di-
visions—the College
and the schools of
law and commerce.
Several other endowment-supported in-
itiatives are planned for the School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics and for the
School of Law. An executive-in-residence
Program will bring experienced business

 

 

new archives for the papers of Justice Lewis
F. Powell Jr.

Clearly, increasing Washington and
Lee’s endowment and funding new in-
itiatives will not be easy. But members of

vantage of good ones.”

Although Washington and Lee’s endow-
ment constantly grows, it is significantly
smaller than that of its peer institutions.
Among 25 of the premier liberal arts institu-
tions in the country,
W&L was ranked
21st in the size of its
endowment per stu-
dent. It is imperative,
University officials
say, that the endow-
ment grow if Wash-
ington and Lee is to
continue offering the
sort of education that
has been traditional
here for so many years.

“We must support the University for the
future,” says Broomall. “Washington and
Lee’s tradition of forward-looking leadership
must continue.”

For most Washington and Lee students, spring-
time means rock bands at fraternity parties, perhaps
a musical at the Troubadour ‘Theatre, and warm lazy
afternoons along the Colonnade, when the strains of
WLUR echo from stereos in the freshman dorms.

But for six W&L students, the 1990 spring term
offered a musical experience of a different sort. Such
as Phantom of the Opera, The Marriage of Figaro, and
the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

The students were enrolled in W&L’s first spring-
term-abroad program with a concentration in music.
For six weeks, they lived in London and lived music,
attending operas, musicals, and performances by some
of the world’s premier ensembles.

“To spend a month and a half learning and spend-
ing time with something you love so much—well, that
was an incredible opportunity,” says one of the stu-
dents, senior Rob Aliff of Oak Hill, W.Va. “It was a
life-altering experience.”

In addition to Aliff, the students who enrollled in
the course were his classmates Patti Carr of Greens-
boro, N.C.; Franklin Daniels of Chattanooga, Tenn.;
Amy Hatcher of Bidwell, Ohio; Laura Lyman of
Gurnee, Ill.; and Bryan Patterson of Shreveport, La.
‘They were accompanied by Gordon P. Spice, pro-
fessor of music.

None of the stu-
dents was a music ma-
jor. (W&L_ began
offering a major

  
 
  
  

in music in

Les Misérah bi

 

1988.) In fact, their majors represent a cross-section

of the Washington and Lee curriculum: history, jour-
nalism, English, economics, psychology, and biology.
“But one thing we all have in common,” Aliff says,
“is that we absolutely love music. Each of us has
made a conscious effort to make music a hobby. It’s
not Our major or our Career, so
there’s no pressure. It’s just
as something we enjoy.”
And enjoy it they did. The
students attended 25 live musical
adi events in 37 days, including musicals,

orchestral performances, and evensong
services at Cambridge, Oxford, Canter-
bury, Westminster Abbey, and St. Paul's.

:
>

}

Before each performance, Spice conduct-

ed classes on the music
the students would hear.
They listened to record-
ings and discussed the
composers and their in-
dividual styles.

“Nothing can compare
with a live performance,
especially a live perfor-
mance in a different
culture,” says Aliff. Hat-

cher agrees: “When you

eT.

see music, it’s actually liv-
ing and not just something
on a tape or a record.”
In addition to attend-
ing musical events, the
students dabbled in the
visual arts and _ visited
many of London's mu-

seums. “I gained an ap-

preciation for the visual arts that I didn’t have before,”

Aliff says.

The students agreed, however, that the most ex-
citing part of their trip was the chance to experience
another culture. “During six weeks we learned an ap-
preciation for another culture and were able to inter-
act with people from another country,” Aliff says. “If
that’s not the basis for a liberal arts education, I’m not
sure I know the definition.”

Since her return to the United States, Hatcher
says, she has begun “looking at things differently.’
“Rob [Aliff]
and |

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both are from tiny little places in Appalachia.

The entire time we joked about it—you

know, ‘Oak Hill, W.Va., and Bidwell, Ohio,
go to London.’ But how could I pass it up? |
knew I would probably never have a chance

to do something like this again.”

 

 

A CONVERSATION WITH
stevens miles

THE NEW
RECTOR

BY: ANNE COULLING

A. Stevens Miles Jr., 51, planned to begin his retirement
by playing more golf, relaxing in his Florida winter home,
and generally leading a more relaxing life. Instead, he agreed
to become the new rector of Washington and Lee’s Board
of ‘Trustees.

Miles was elected to the position during the Board’s fall
meeting in October. He succeeds James M. Ballengee, ’48L,
who has served as rector since 1981.

His election means that Miles’s retirement plans will
change quite a bit. He expects to spend less time on the
golf course and more on the telephone, in meetings, and in
airports as he travels to see alumni all across the country.

It wasn’t quite what Miles had in mind when he stepped
down last year as chairman and chief executive officer of
First Kentucky National Corp. in Louisville. But then again,
much of his life hasn't turned out quite the way Steve Miles
had envisioned it.

He certainly never anticipated spending his entire 36-
year career with a bank in his hometown—or becoming the
youngest president in that institution’s history. And he
couldn't have dreamed that his daughter, Elizabeth, would be
a member of the first fully coeducational class at his a/ma
mater, \Nashington and Lee, or that she would become
W&L’s first female All-American athlete.

But throughout his life, Miles has learned to anticipate
Surprises and adjust to them. So when he was asked to be
Washington and Lee’s new
rector, he readily accepted.

“Washington and Lee
has meant so much to me
and to my family,” he says
simply. “I can’t think of an
institution I'd rather serve.”

Steve Miles first heard
of Washington and Lee
when he was a boy growing
up in Louisville. His uncle, H. Edward Rietze Jr., °25, had
been a cheerleader at W&L and was an enthusiastic alum-
nus. “I decided that if Uncle Ed liked Washington and Lee,
| would, too,” Miles explains. “I didn’t apply anywhere else.”

WASHINGTON AND LEE
HAS MEANT SO MUCH TO ME
AND TO MY FAMILY. | CAN'T THINK OF
AN INSTITUTION I'D RATHER SERVE.

 

 

After grad- uating from
Kentucky Mil- itary In-
stitute, Miles arrived at
W&L in the fall of 1947.
He had never seen the
campus. (“I remem-
ber being sur- prised by

how beautiful it was,” he recalls.) He pledged Phi Delta
Theta and declared a major in economics.

Those were interesting times at Washington and Lee and
at other colleges and universities across the country. The
end of World War II and the GI bill meant the student body
was divided between veterans and recent high-school gradu-
ates. “The veterans were older and had seen much more of
life than we had,” Miles says. “We were just wide-eyed kids.”

Miles remembers such teachers as William G. Bean, John
Higgins Williams, and E. Claybrook Griffith, who taught a
course in comparative economic systems. “I still think of
those men,” Miles says. “Good professors can’t teach you
all there is to know, but they stimulate your thirst for
knowledge; so when you get out of school you want to
continue to learn.”

Late in his college career, America’s involvement in
Korea escalated, and Miles was drafted just after commence-
ment. He graduated from Officer Candidate School and was
ordered to Fort Lewis, Wash., to serve as a battle indoctri-
nation instructor. He was
deactivated in 1953 and
returned to Louisville.

Miles then considered
moving to New York
City. But his hometown
seemed more and more
attractive. He entered the
management training pro-
gram at the First Na-
tional Bank of Louisville “as a starting point.” Soon he
discovered he enjoyed the work too much to leave.

In 1972, at the age of 42, Miles became the youngest
president in the bank’s history. Two years later, he was also

W&L 15

named chief executive officer of the bank and its holding

company. He saw the bank’s assets grow from $250 million
to $5 billion, and he directed its merger with National City
Corp. in Cleveland in 1987 to form a $23 billion institution.
He became president of National City following the merger.

“I really had a marvelous career,” he says, “and enjoyed
every bit of it.”

In 1954, Miles married Berry Houston of Louisville, an
alumna of Vassar College. Elizabeth is their only child; their
son, Frank, died in 1976.

It was only by chance that Elizabeth decided to attend
Washington and Lee. In the fall of 1984—during her senior
year in high school—her parents took her on a tour of
Virginia colleges. ‘They had not planned to look at Washing-
ton and Lee, but they spent the evening in Lexington and
took a tour of the campus. Elizabeth was enchanted.

As they walked along the Colonnade that night, the fami-
ly heard noise coming from Warner Center. “Come on,”
Miles said. “I'll show you where we used to play basketball.”
But instead of a ball game, they
discovered a swim meet.

Kentucky National Corp. and National City Corp.
in Cleveland.

When his daughter began making her mark at Wash-
ington and Lee, Miles turned more of his attention to his
alma mater. \n 1988, he accepted an invitation to join
W&L’s Board of ‘Trustees.

Because he was the father of a student—in addition to
being an alumnus in his own right—Miles brought a special
viewpoint to the Board.

“| have a much more current perspective because I have
seen the University function in today’s environment,” he
says. “We're in a totally different world from when I went to
W&L, and Elizabeth’s attendance here helped me understand
that. I have personally witnessed the transformation to a co-
educational student body and I’m very proud of the results.”

Miles also learned that W&L’s qualities have remained in-
tact. A “special spirit” exists at the school, he says, a spirit
that resists precise definition.

“Part of it is the relationship between students and the

 

It must have been fate.
Elizabeth had won numerous
state swimming championships
back in Kentucky, so natu-
rally she was interested. After the
meet ended, she and her father
met Coach Page Remillard, who
confirmed his intention to begin
a women’s swim team when the
school became coeducational.
The following autumn, Elizabeth
enrolled at her dad’s school.

She made an immediate
impression.

During her freshman year—
the first season of women’s sports
at W&L—she qualified to com-
pete at the national Division III
championships, where she earned
All-American honors. She would
be named an All-American again
in her senior year.

Twice she was designated
ODAC Swimmer of the Year, and
she won W&L’s Outstanding
Female Athlete Award in 1989.
A psychology major, she was
also a member of Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority.

It’s littke wonder, then, that
Elizabeth helped rekindle her
father’s interest in W&L.
Throughout his career, Miles had stayed busy with various
civic activities in Louisville. He served on numerous civic
and charitable boards in the city and state and was a trustee

of the University of Kentucky and an overseer of the Univer-

sity of Louisville.
He continues to serve on the boards of directors of First

16 W&L

 

 

faculty. Part of it involves tradition and history. And of
course the Honor System is the cornerstone of student life at
W&L. It has a significant impact on all of our lives from our
time as students on.

“Washington and Lee has a top academic program. It’s
hard; not unfair, but demanding.”

aii i i ieee

 

If they are to preserve those qualities, Miles says, he and
his fellow trustees must overcome some difficult challenges.
The first of those involves resources.

“So many of our decisions are financially driven,” he says.
“We want to make Washington and Lee available

and it must survive,” he believes, “then it wi// survive
such tests.”
As rector, Miles will be concerned with the overall opera-
tion of the University. He is quick to point out, however,
that “the trustees

 

from a financial standpoint to students who respect
our traditions and will fulfill the destiny of leadership
that has characterized graduates of this institution.”

The trustees have decided to limit enrollment to
|,600 undergraduates and 350 law students. “We
can't, therefore, increase our revenues by increasing
our population,” Miles explains. “We must either in-
crease the tuition or increase other sources, such as
endowment. If we don’t increase the endowment, tui-
tion will more than double in the next 10 years
because of increasing costs. We think that’s in-
tolerable, so we must double the size of our endow-
ment. Actually, my personal goal is to see our endow-
ment reach $250 million by the year 2000.”

The trustees’ primary
concern, Miles says, is to
bring the University into
the 21st century with ade-
quate resources. During the
next decade, many current
members of the faculty will
retire; their successors
must have the same respect
for W&L’s traditions and
heritage as those they
will succeed.

Miles also wants to en-
sure that the fraternity re-
naissance program moves
forward and that students
“are held accountable for
their actions and for the
condition of fraternity property.” At
the same time, the University must
maintain its strong history of student
self-governance and “social freedom.”

And, Miles adds, the Honor Sys-
tem will endure certain challenges in
the years to come. “Some things are
obviously honor code issues, such as
giving and receiving information on
exams,” he says. “But there are
other indiscretions that aren't ob-
viously honor code violations.

“We live in a much more com-
plex world today, and things aren’t
as simple as they used to be. It’s
going to be difficult for the Execu-
tive Committee to determine what is and what isn’t an
Honor System violation, and we're going to encourage them
to meet those challenges.”

Miles remains convinced, though, that the Honor Sys-
tem will endure. “If we all agree that the Honor System
itself is an extraordinarily valuable part of this institution

 

 

 

are not responsi-
ble for the admin-
istration of this in-
stitution. That is
clearly President
Wilson’s prero-
gative, and it
should be.”

Instead, Miles
will work closely
with the president
in developing
policies for W&L.
He also hopes to
act as Wilson’s
“sounding board.”

“Being the
president of a
university or any
institution is a
very lonely posi-
tion,” he explains.

“A person
in that position
needs an objective
outside viewpoint
from time to time,
and I plan to be
available for the
president to ask
me my opinion
about different
matters.”

The respon-
sibilities of a rec-
tor are consider-
able. But Miles
seems to welcome
the challenge. For
one thing, he has
an outstanding
group of trus-
tees with whom
to work.

“I am impressed by the depth of knowledge they have
about this institution,” he says. “They are extremely well-
informed and dedicated to this school.”

And besides, none of them—including himself—could be
working for a better cause.

“I've worked hard for the major community organizations
in Louisville,” Miles says. “Now is the time for me to think
about this University.

“I'm going to make every contribution I can to Wash-
ington and Lee.”

 

IF WE ALL AGREE
THAT THE HONOR
SYSTEM IS AN
EXTRAORDINARILY
VALUABLE PART OF
THIS INSTITUTION ,
THEN IT WILL SURVIVE.

| WSL JUNIORS SAIL ~
THE AEGEAN

It sounded like the perfect summer vacation—six
weeks in Greece, sailing the Aegean, Except, of
course, for one minor detail—no one was at all sure
the ship would float.

_ J. Kent Gregory, "92, and Michael J. Sebesta, 92,
had their doubts lastsummer when they left for
Greece. They planned to join the crew of the O/m-
pias, the first modern reconstruction of an ancient
trireme.

by William Cocke,

More than 2,000 years ago, the trireme helped the -

Athenian navy dominate the Mediterranean. But little
is Known today about the light, maneuverable war-
ship, since’ few remains have been discovered and the
written record provides scant detail. Indeed, the
debate over what a trireme actually looked like and
how it functioned has ~

he adds, “all
of us were inexperienced, since no one has built,

“When you come right down to it,”

crewed or even.seen a real trireme for thousands
of years!” |

Indeed, no one was actually sure just how to build
a trireme. Some experts said the name. implied three
tiers of rowers, while others insisted the word meant
something else—such as three men to an oar. After a
sudden renewal of the debate in the letters section of
the London 7imes, three Englishmen decided to put

the matter to rest by building a real trireme—as close |

to an original as possible:

The Greek government readily agreed to help with
the financing and construction, Gregory says. “The
trireme is a powerful national symbol to the Greeks, a
reminder of their

 

engaged scholars,

archaeologists, and
ship enthusiasts for
many years.

Senior named
first Smith fellow

Alisann McGloin, 91, of Bronx-
ville, N.Y., has received the first
Todd C. Smith Memorial Fellow-
ship at Washington and Lee.

Smith, °83, was a reporter and
columnist for the 7Zampa Tribune
until his death in November 1989.
He was allegedly killed by terrorists
in Peru while investigating drug
trafficking.

The fellowship will allow
McGloin to spend six weeks in
Moscow this spring working with
John-Thor Dahlburg, ’75, Moscow
correspondent for the Los Angeles
Times. She hopes to do research for
a series of articles on the role of
women in the Soviet Union.

The fellowship was established
last year by Smith’s family and
friends and the 7rbune. It is
designed to help aspiring journalists
at Washington and Lee to become
foreign correspondents by pro-
viding a stipend to travel and study
in the country of their choice.

Earlier in the year, Smith was
awarded a posthumous citation for
international reporting from the
Mollie Parnis Livingston Founda-
tion. In presenting the citation,
Mike Wallace of CBS-TV’s “60
Minutes” said that although the
panel of judges usually resists the
impulse to make special awards,
“The more we learned about Smith
himself, the more he seemed to be
just the sort of young journalist the

22 W&L

 

Livingstons were established to en-
courage.”

During the presentation cere-
mony for the Smith fellowship at
Washington and Lee, many
speakers echoed Wallace’s words.

“Even though I didn’t know
‘Todd personally, I have heard a lot
about this young man since his un-
timely death,” said John W. Elrod,
vice president for academic affairs
at W&L and dean of the College.

“I gather this is just the sort of
practical, no-nonsense, working
memorial he would have preferred.
His life, which was spent going
after the big story, has now become
a story in itself, and the inspira-
tional and educational values em-
bodied by Todd will continue to
resonate year after year through
this living memorial.”

In presenting the fellowship to
McGloin, Smith’s father, Robert P.
Smith Jr., °54, spoke of his son’s
courage. “Courage is something we
see in retrospect, not something
we are aware of at the time. Todd
knew the moral necessity of keep-
ing up his courage, of putting one
foot ahead of the other.”

Lawrence McConnell, °71,
managing editor of the Z7ampa
Tribune, organized the fund-raising
effort that has brought in more than
half of the fund’s $100,000 goal.
“The gifts have come from all over
the country, cutting across all age
groups and coming from class-
mates, colleagues, friends, and
other W&L alumni involved in
journalism,” said Lex McMillan,
°72, executive director of develop-
ment at W&L. “Many donors nei-
ther knew Smith nor have any con-
nection to Washington and Lee.”

McGloin, a journalism major and
staff member of the Ring-tum Phi
and WLUR radio station, said that
Smith “set a higher standard for
himself than most of us do. All I've
learned about him is what an ex-
traordinary person he was.

“This fellowship will help W&L
students attain the ideals he
honored most.”

Added McConnell: “The Todd
Smith Memorial Fellowship incor-
porates his life as an example to
others. If Alisann McGloin and
future recipients go on to suc-
cessful, enriching careers as jour-
nalists and foreign correspondents,
then they are the perfect continua-
tion and realization of his legacy.”

W&L ranks 15th in national list

For the fourth consecutive year,
Washington and Lee has been
ranked among the nation’s top 25
liberal arts colleges and universities
by U.S. News & World Report.

And for the second year in a row,
the University was named the
“Best Buy” in liberal arts colleges
and universities.

In its Oct. 15 issue, U.S. News
divided the nation’s top schools
into two categories: national
universities and national liberal arts
colleges. Washington and Lee was
ranked 15th in the national liberal
arts category, moving up from 18th
place last year. The top school in
that category was Amherst
College.

The only other Virginia institu-
tion mentioned in the two
categories was the University of

Virginia, which was ranked 18th
among national universities. Har-
vard University was first in that
category.

Washington and Lee’s low tui-
tion rate—$10,850 for the 1990-9]
academic year —was responsible for
its “Best Buy” recognition.

U.S. News based its rankings on
the selectivity of a school’s student
body; the degree to which it finan-.
cially supports a high-quality, full-
time faculty; its overall financial
resources; and the level of student
satisfaction as measured by a
school’s ability to graduate the
students it admits as freshmen.
The magazine’s ranking system
combines statistical data with the
results of a survey of academic
reputations.

W&L receives grant for duPont papers

The Jessie Ball duPont Religious, Charitable, and Educational Fund
has given Washington and Lee a grant of $81,500 to organize two col-

lections of duPont papers.

Jessie Ball duPont bequeathed to W&L the papers of her husband,
Alfred I. duPont, in 1970. Her own papers were later given to the Univer-
sity by the Jessie Ball duPont Fund. Both sets of papers had been housed
in the fund’s Jacksonville, Fla., headquarters awaiting completion of the

duPonts’ biographies.

The papers are now in Rockville, Md., where they are being processed
and organized by a professional archival company. They should be ready
for shipment to the special collections department of Washington and

Lee’s library in 1992.

The grant will pay for moving expenses, archival processing and
description, production of a published guide, and new shelving for

the collection.

Jessie Ball duPont received an honorary degree from W&L in 1947,
and in 1959 she became the first female member of the Board of Trus-
tees. She served on the Board until her death in 1970.

Angelia Allen named to admissions staff

Angelia V. Allen has been named
assistant director of admissions at
Washington and Lee.

A graduate of Mary Washington
College, Allen also holds a master’s
degree from the University of
Virginia.

She has served as assistant direc-
tor of admissions at Sweet Briar
College, where her responsibilities
included student recruitment,
travel, interviewing, panel discus-
sions, and academic and personal
counseling. She also coordinated
minority student recruitment and
directed a program called “Science

Challenge,” which encourages high
school minority women to paf-
ticipate in science and math.

Allen also worked at Mary Wash-
ington College, where she was
assistant dean of admissions.

“Angelia’s broad admissions ex-
perience makes her an ideal addi-
tion to our staff,” said William M.
Hartog, dean of admissions and
financial aid at W&L, in announc-
ing the appointment. “In the in-
creasingly competitive field of ad-
missions, we are fortunate to have
someone with Angelia’s back-
ground.”

Five-Star Generals, Young Alumni Return for Busy Homecoming Weekend

Crowds of alumni, a thrilling
come-from-behind football victory,
spectacular fall foliage—it had all
the ingredients of a perfect Home-
coming weekend.

The annual event brought
together the Five-Star Gen-
erals—alumni who graduated from
Washington and Lee at least 50
years ago—and members of the
classes of 1987, ’88, ’89, and ’90,
who held special cluster reunions.

Also gathering for their fall
meetings were the Alumni Board
of Directors and the Law Council.

The weekend began Friday,
Oct. 12, with a memorial service

 

 

 

in Lee Chapel honoring Robert E.
Lee on the 120th anniversary of his
death. (Excerpts from the keynote
address appear on page 25.)
Meanwhile, Thomas D.
Morgan, Oppenheim professor at
George Washington University’s
National Law Center, delivered the
annual John Randolph Tucker lec-

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

ture in the School of Law.
Morgan’s address was titled “In
Defense of Legal Education.”

Later in the day, alumni attend-
ed a panel discussion about global
economies and a program concern-
ing career planning.

Other highlights of the weekend
included receptions, an authentic

 

 

 

 

“Oktoberfest” luncheon, a choral
concert, and the traditional football
game. The Generals scored three
touchdowns in the second half to
defeat Hampden-Sydney 21-7.

During halftime, W&L senior
Jean Stroman of Hilton Head
Island, S.C., was crowned Home-
coming queen.

 

 

 

 

Clockwise from top left: Ollie Gluyas, '38, chats with another Five-Star General during the Oktoberfest luncheon. Assembling after their meeting are the members of the Alumni
Board: from left, (seated) alumni director Jim Farrar, Gene Perry, John Robinson, and Dick O'Connell; (standing) Ed Meyers, Mason New, Waller Dudley, John Cocklereece,

the keynote address during the Lee

memorial service on Homecoming

weekend. Goodwin spoke about Lee’s

legacies—to his army, to the Confederate

states, to the nation, and to Washington

and Lee University.

Excerpts from Goodwin's speech appear below.

 

Part of Lee’s legacy to the
United States has grown out of his
legacy to this University. Had Lee
not chosen Washington College,
with its little $1,500 salary, over
the thousands of dollars being of-
fered him by insurance companies
and other business enterprises,
chances are the little college would
have folded. Certainly it would not
have become the shining beacon of
education and integrity that it
is today.

But he did come here, and in five
years he set a small classical col-
lege on its way to becoming a fine
university.

Addition of the new courses—
chemistry, engineering, commerce,
journalism, and the law school—
was perceptive and important. But
it was his legacy of intangibles—
character, self-discipline, leader-
ship, and honor—that has made a
lasting difference in those 25,000
Washington and Lee men and
women who have followed him
here. Their lives, their conduct,
and their usefulness have been a
part of Lee’s legacy to this united
country.

. . .Let us as individuals think
about his or her personal legacy
from Robert E. Lee. When did you
first sense that legacy—his legacy
to you—of personal responsibility,
of self-discipline, of courtesy,
of honor?

For some students and alumni,
it was at freshman camp when
someone told them that they were
henceforth their own disciplinar-
ians—with no parent, no teacher,
no book of rules to tell them what
to do; only an expectation of
gentlemanly (and _ladylike)

behavior and a simple, but rigid,
honor system.

That is when an 18-year-old
becomes an adult overnight.

One alumnus told me he felt the
impact of Lee’s legacy when he
looked from the Colonnade toward
Lee Chapel one moonlit night and
realized what the majestic man
buried here expected of him.

Think about that—what a man
dead and buried more than 100
years expected of him!

Another told me of sitting in the
chapel and looking at the portrait
of Lee for half an hour before going
to turn in a friend for a violation of
the Honor System.

...Who among you—student,
alumnus, faculty member, or Lex-
ington neighbor—can lie? That
very inability is your legacy from
Robert E. Lee, who created the
Honor System that has stood the
test of 125 years.

Can you cheat? Can you steal?
Can you file a false tax return? Can
you take advantage of another
human being? Answer those ques-
tions, and you will know why you
are here today. Yes, and you will
know why others like you—your
sons and your daughters, other
Americans from now 50 indivisible
states, and strangers from other
parts of a shrinking world—will
follow us to this place.

Here, in a few hours visit or a
few years’ stay, those who come
after us will inherit their legacies
from Robert E. Lee. They will go
from this campus better men and
better women; and, with those
legacies from Lee in their minds
and in their hearts, they will make
a better world.

Parents attend annual weekend

More than 1,900 family mem-
bers of Washington and Lee stu-
dents attended the 1990 Parents’
Weekend, held during a balmy
few days at the beginning of
November.

The event gave parents an op-
portunity to see the campus, to at-
tend classes, and to meet with
members of the W&L faculty.

The weekend's schedule includ-
ed several musical concerts, recep-
tions, an outdoor luncheon, and
athletic events. On Saturday morn-
ing, President John D. Wilson
presented his annual address to
parents. That afternoon, the

26 W&L

Generals defeated Guilford College
in an exciting 28-22 football con-
test at Wilson Field.

“We hope the families of our
students were able to see Wash-
ington and Lee at its best,” says
Christine L. Davis, °89, coor-
dinator of Parents’ Weekend.

One hundred Washington and
Lee alumni who are parents of cur-
rent students attended the event,
Davis says. “Parents came from as
far away as California and Wyo-
ming to see their sons and
daughters and to visit Washington
and Lee. They made the entire
weekend a success.”

W&L to compete for Hughes grant

The Howard Hughes Medical
Institute of Bethesda, Md., has
chosen Washington and Lee to
compete for $30.5 million in grants
to strengthen undergraduate
science education.

W&L is one of 99 colleges and
universities competing for the five-
year grants, which range from
$500,000 to $2 million. Only one
other college in Virginia was
selected to compete.

The institutions were chosen
based on the proportion and
number of their graduates who, in
the last decade, have gone on to
medical school or to earn doc-
torates in biology, chemistry,
physics, or mathematics.

“The aim of the program is to
foster student interest in careers in
medicine, science research, and
teaching by supporting exciting
education opportunities in the
sciences at the undergraduate
level,” says Dr. Joseph G. Perpich,
the institute’s vice president for
grants and special programs.

The Howard Hughes Medical
Institute, which was established in
1953, employs scientists in the
fields of cell biology, genetics, im-
munology, neuroscience, and
structural biology. It also supports
science education activities through
its grants program.

Publication seeks works by alumni

The staff of Ane/, Washington
and Lee’s student literary
magazine, is seeking contributions
from alumni in the form of poetry,
prose, and artwork.

In the past, students have been
the primary source of creative work
published by Ane/. But as the size
of the publication is increasing, “the
staff realized alumni presented an
untapped source of talent for the

magazine,” explains staff member
Paul M. Mazyck, ’92.

“Alumni undoubtedly have a
changed view of Washington and
Lee since their departure from the
campus, and Ane/ welcomes this
new viewpoint as a creative addi-
tion to the student perspective.”

Submissions should be sent to
Ariel, University Center, c/o Ms.
Carol Calkins, Washington and
Lee University, Lexington, VA
24450. The deadline for the winter
issue is March 8, 1991.

First-year students strengthen University

Washington and Lee began the
1990-91 academic year with
another strong group of first-year
students.

The 391 members of the
freshman class were drawn from a
pool of 3,067 applicants. More
than 10 percent of the class—40
students—are children of Wash-
ington and Lee alumni.

The freshmen include 34 Na-
tional Merit scholars and finalists
and 33 valedictorians and
salutatorians. Forty-seven of them
served as president or vice presi-
dent of their high school class or
student body; 87 were presidents
of major student organizations; 90
were team captains; and 52 edited
their high school yearbook or
literary magazine.

The students represent 41 states
and six foreign countries. About 10
percent of them come from

Virginia, with Texas, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, New York, and Georgia
also contributing significant
numbers.

Nineteen of the freshmen are
members of minority groups.

The 147 members of the first-
year law class represent 35 states
and 94 different undergraduate in-
stitutions. The students range in
age from 21 to 42; women make
up 45 percent of the class. More
than 70 percent of the students
spent at least a year working after
they completed their under-
graduate degrees and before they
entered law school.

Fourteen first-year students—
10 percent of the class—are
members of minority groups.

For the first time in its history,
the School of Law received more
than 2,000 applications for the
entering class.

 

 

 

Class agents
attend workshop

About 45 Washington and Lee
alumni who serve as class agents
came to Lexington for a workshop
in early September.

The workshop was designed to
educate the participants about the
purpose of the Annual Fund and to
explain their duties as agents.

“One important emphasis of the
weekend was that all alumni—
regardless of their age or the
amount they are capable of
giving—are critically important to
the Annual Fund’s success,” said
Mason T. New, ’62, chairman of
the 1990-91 fund.

“It is crucial to the University
that we meet our overall goal of
$2.165 million,” New said.
“Budgetarily, Washington and Lee
counts on this money as it goes in-
to the school year.

“We also want to encourage our
alumni to contribute to the fund
each and every year. Participation
is an important measure of the
fund’s success, and it’s an area that

we would like to improve.”

In particular, New is concerned
about alumni who rotate their giv-
ing. “Consistently, only 37 or 38
percent of our alumni contribute,”
he said. “But it isn’t the same 37
percent each year.

“If all alumni who have given
once in the last five years were to
give this year, we would reach
50 percent.”

At the weekend’s conclusion,
New believed the fund’s goals
could be reached. “Our students
and alumni have such strong feel-
ings about Washington and Lee
that we’re convinced we can rise to
the challenge and reach a participa-
tion rate of at least 50 percent in
the next few years.”

In addition to their regular
meetings, the class agents attend-
ed a number of other gatherings
during the weekend, including a
special banquet, the Athletic Hall
of Fame initiation ceremony, and
a Generals’ football game.

Fancy Dress scheduled for March 8

Plans are already underway for
the 84th annual Fancy Dress Ball,
which will be held Friday, March
8, at 9 p.m. in Washington and
Lee’s Warner Center.

The weekend's festivities will
open Thursday evening with a con-
cert and dance at the Student Ac-
tivities Pavilion.

To make it easier for alumni to
attend this year’s ball, the Student
Activities Board has arranged block
room reservations at area motels.
Alumni may call one of the motels
listed below and request a “Fancy

Dress Block Room.” These rooms
will be released two weeks prior to
the ball, so reservations should be
made as soon as possible to ensure
accommodations.

Tickets for the ball are $40 per
couple and may be obtained from
the Student Activities Board,
University Center, Washington and
Lee University, Lexington, VA
24450.

Murphy

Wilson, Murphy honored by fraternities

W&L President John D. Wilson and Col. Paul J. B. Murphy Jr., 49,
recently received awards from the National Interfraternity Conference
for their roles in Washington and Lee’s fraternity renaissance program.

The NIC established the awards in 1989 to recognize individuals and
organizations that exemplify the highest ideals of interfraternalism through
participation in and support of programs and through activities that foster
interfraternal understanding and spirit.

NIC president Henry L. Bauer said of Wilson and Murphy, “A pro-
gram of this magnitude would not move forward without the approval
of the university president. In this instance, it is not just the appproval
by Dr. Wilson but his advocacy of the program that distinguishes his under-
taking from others.”

He added, “It is not an overstatement to label Col. Murphy the prin-
cipal architect of the renaissance program in his service as chairman of
the University’s fraternity renovation housing steering committee.”

The renaissance program involves the physical renovation of 14 of
W&L’s fraternity houses. Work has nearly been completed on six houses,
and the entire project is scheduled to be finished by September 1992.

The National Interfraternity Conference is a confederation of 60 men’s
college fraternities representing more than 4.5 million alumni and 400,000
students across the United States and Canada.

In August, Murphy received another honor from his own fraternity,
Sigma Nu. He was named Alumnus of the Year during the national frater-
nity’s grand chapter meeting. Murphy was cited for his leadership in
reestablishing the Sigma Nu chapter at W&L in the early 1980s as well
as for his work with the University’s fraternity renaissance program.

Historians discuss Chinese politics

The story was sadly familiar—
idealistic Chinese who struggle for
“democratic” reform, only to have
their hopes crushed by the forces
of Communism.

Historians from across the globe
gathered at Washington and Lee in
late September to revisit that story
from China’s past. Their topic,
however, was not the tragic events
of ‘Tiananmen Square in 1989. In-
stead, they looked farther back, to
the decades before Mao T’se-tung’s
victory in 1949,

Washington and Lee’s East

Asian Studies program and the An--

drew W. Mellon Foundation spon-
sored the conference, which was
titled “Oppositional Politics in
20th-Century China.” The meeting
attracted 50 historians, some com-
ing from as far away as Australia,
Canada, the Soviet Union, and
even the People’s Republic of
China itself.

During the years between 1921
and 1949, numerous political par-
ties sprang up to oppose both the
Kuomintang and the Chinese
Communists. Historians have
dubbed them “third parties.”
“Ultimately, these groups failed,”
explains Roger B. Jeans, professor
of history at W&L and organizer
of the conference. “We wanted to
see why they failed and what has
happened to them in the 40 years
since their defeat.”

Although the conference par-
ticipants frequently disagreed dur-
ing discussions, Jeans says most

28 W&L

reached accord on one point—that
conditions in China during the
Republican period simply doomed
the oppositional parties.

“Conditions weren't conducive
to democratic reforms,” he says.
“Concepts such as civil rights,
parliamentary rule, and a two-party
system couldn't survive in an at-
mosphere dominated by the gun.
China had so many horrible
problems—civil war, poverty, a
Japanese invasion.

“Besides, although some of these
political leaders preached demo-
cracy, they didn’t always practice
it. They may have grasped it in-
tellectually, but they sometimes
couldn’t grasp it emotionally.”

Although Tiananmen Square
was not the focus of the con-
ference, Jeans says it “loomed over”
the participants. “One speaker said
that 10 years ago, when China
seemed to be opening up, no one
would have been as interested in
these earlier oppositional parties.”

The conference participants
wondered, too, whether the
students who led the demonstra-
tions in the spring of 1989 have

learned anything from their.

predecessors. “They don’t seem to
be drawing any lessons from the
parties of the ’20s, ’30s, and 40s,”
Jeans says. “There’s been a failure
to build upon their own traditions.

“They are oriented toward
Western political models, and no
one is sure they can imple-
ment them.”

Students participate in capital jury study

A Washington and Lee graduate,
a law professor, and several
students have joined together in
an unusual study of capital
punishment.

The two-year project, which is
being funded by the National
Science Foundation, is intended to
discover why individual jurors vote
for or against the death penalty.

Lawyers, law students, and
social scientists from eight states
across the country are involved in
the study, which is being directed
by William J. Bowers, 57. Bowers
is principal research scientist for
the College of Criminal Justice at
Northeastern University and has
written extensively about the
operation of capital statutes.

The study’s principal researcher
in Virginia is William S. Geimer,
professor of law at W&L. Geimer
is overseeing a team of W&L law
students, who plan to interview
120 jurors from 30 capital trials in
Virginia during the next two years.
They will also speak with judges,
prosecutors, and defense attorneys.

The researchers are trying to
determine what factors influence
the decisions of jurors. “Underly-
ing the law are assumptions about
what jurors do,” Bowers explains.
“The court lays out standards of ra-
tional behavior jurors are supposed
to follow. We want to see if there
are other factors, too—‘extra-legal’
influences, such as arbitrariness
and discrimination and social in-
fluences.”

The study is innovative for a
number of reasons. “In the past, a

 

lot of research has been done by
drawing inferences from the out-
comes of trials,” Geimer says,
“Now, in this study, we propose to
look into the ‘black box’—to ex-
amine in a structured, scientific
way and with a significant data
sample, how these decisions are
made by jurors.”

Too, the study is unusual in its
interdisciplinary nature—it brings
together a large group of lawyers,
criminologists, and social psy-
chologists. “There’s been growing
cooperation beween the law and
social science in the past few
years,” Geimer says. “But to my
knowledge, this is the largest re-
cent cooperative venture between
the two fields in the area of criminal
justice.”

The collaboration should benefit
everyone concerned, Bowers
believes. “Each of us has his or her
Own perspective, and now we're
working together as a team,” he
says. “We can see the issues more
clearly when we look at them
through each other’s eyes.”

While the study should provide
valuable information to both
lawyers and sociologists, it is also
giving the law students themselves
an extraordinary experience.

“It’s been very helpful to be able
to see a trial from beginning to
end,” says Matthew Pollack, ’92L,
of Rockville Centre, N.Y. “And
most lawyers also don’t have a
chance to speak with jurors after a
trial has ended. This should be in-
valuable to us in our careers as
attorneys.”

Pages from the Past: A Look Back Through the Alumni Magazine

Francis Pendleton Gaines became president of Washington and Lee
University October 25.

In historic Lee Chapel where four of his predecessors have taken their
oath of office, the 38-year-old educator promised to discharge faithfully
the duties of president to the best of his skill and judgment without fear
or favor.

Gowned in the robes of a doctor of philosophy, Doctor Gaines bowed
before Valentine’s recumbent statue of General Robert E. Lee and
repeated in a clear voice the words of the president's oath, while represen-
tatives of 140 American colleges and universities—forty of them also
presidents—occupied pews in the chapel built by the great Confederate
leader when head of the school after the War Between the States.

—November 1930

From President Gaines:

Just about the time our alumni receive this issue of the Magazine,
we open for the use of our present students the new library building. It
is the old building almost doubled in capacity, made fireproof, brought
into truer harmony with our architectural pattern, adapted to best library
experience in general as applied to our own needs and purposes.

Here will be housed the greater part of our collection of more than
one hundred thousand volumes; here will be a dozen or more special rooms
for varied processes of learning with books and from books; here will be
several rooms for particular collections of historic or sentimentally precious
volumes. We are adding a resource of incalculable value.

A later note in the magazine adds:

Since the new building was constructed with money given by the
McCormick family, it seemed very proper to name the new library the
Cyrus Hall McCormick Library in memory of the inventor of the reaper.
Mr. McCormick was a member of the Board of ‘Trustees for twenty years
and was in a great measure responsible for the development of Washington
and Lee in the latter part of the nineteenth century.

The possibility of another war and military service loomed over
students as the 1950-51 school year began at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. While the world crisis had not greatly affected the student body,
the question “Will I be able to complete the year?” was often heard.

Enrollment-wise, Washington and Lee, as it started its 202nd ses-
sion, still boasted a large cosmopolitan student body. Although the enroll-
ment included students from almost every state and 13 foreign countries,
total enrollment had dropped to 1147, 90 below last year’s figure.

This reduction was seen as resulting from the unusually large graduating
class of last year and not selective service or the recall of reservists.
Only six students who had planned to continue their education at
Washington and Lee failed to register for the current session because of
military service. Seven others were recalled to active duty during
September and October.

But the possibility of a change was not discounted. Dean of Students
Frank J. Gilliam said the University will possibly lose a limited number
of students and members of the faculty, but most students have received
or will receive draft deferments until June 1951. However, any adverse
change in the world situation could upset these calculations.

The University, like the rest of the United States, is preparing itself
for the possibility of war. President Francis Pendleton Gaines has filed
an application with the Department of the Army for the establishment
of an ROTC unit on the campus.

— November 1950

The rains came, but so did the Washington and Lee faithful, to the
1960 Homecoming weekend, Oct. 7-8. On the schedule were: a pep rally;
an alumni coffee hour at Evans Dining Hall; a noon alumni luncheon at
Evans Hall; the thrilling football game between the Generals and the
Diplomats from Franklin and Marshall; the crowning of the Homecom-
ing queen; and the reception after the game for alumni and their families
at the Robert E. Lee Hotel. Phi Gamma Delta won the Alumni Associa-
tion prize for the best frat house display, but the Delta Tau Deltas, tradi-
tional winners, came up with a good idea which took third place, behind
Sigma Phi Epsilon. And to make the day a bright one—in spite of the
showers—the Generals beat Franklin and Marshall, 38 to 8.

—Fall 1960

Washington and Lee’s Republican Club has joined the American Red
Cross campaign to secure better treatment for American prisoners of war
in North Vietnam and their eventual release.

The group is circulating individual letters to be signed by Washington
and Lee students, appealing for the unconditional release of all war cap-
tives and, even before that, for the release of prisoners’ names and better
care, treatment, and facilities.

The signed letters will be sent to North Vietnam's president, according
to the Republican Club leadership.

The campus organization's drive grew out of a resolution of support

unanimously endorsed at its October general meeting.
—December 1970

The School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics moved into its
new home in September—McCormick, the former library, just renovated
and remodeled at a cost of $3.5 million.

The “new” facility has three times as much usable space as Newcomb,
the commerce unit’s building for seven decades— 37,545 sq. ft., as against
11,542. (Newcomb is now undergoing a renovation of its own to become

the home of four undergraduate departments in the humanities.)

Role Models, The Law, and The Church

“In his 1972 gathering of essays, Sincerity and Authenticity, Lionel Tril-
ling reflects on changes in our value system, particularly during the 19th
century—changes that help to account, I believe, for the absence of heroes
that my classmates and I experienced as college students, and that I think
your generation is experiencing as well. Professor Trilling quotes a plain-
tive query by the 18th-century poet Edward Young: ‘Born Originals,’
Young asks, ‘how comes it to pass that we die Copies?

“During your years of soul-searching and self-discovery, you have no
doubt learned how difficult it is for anyone, in an age of ‘Copies,’ to re-
main an ‘Original.’ And you must have learned that it takes more than
a formal curriculum to nourish within us an authentic sense of our being.
At every stage of our development, in order to stimulate our moral and
intellectual growth, we require the immediacy of human models. That
is what Bernard Malamud must have meant when he wrote in The Natural,
his haunting fable of a superachieving baseball star: “Without heroes, we're
all plain people and don’t know how far we can go.’

“. . Some lives are so well formulated, so wisely focused, so humanely
directed, that they elevate those who study them. If we are to become
‘Originals,’ we cannot do so without the example of men and women who,
by their actions and achievements, inspire emulation; who, by their breadth
of their differences from us, unsettle our conventional assumptions and
challenge us to develop more mature philosophies of life; who, by
the conduct of their lives, give distinctive and concrete form to our
highest ideals.”

—James O. Freedman, president of Dartmouth College, during W@L’s
opening convocation, Sept. 6, 1990, in Lee Chapel

“In the American law of church and state. . .law students (even in
law schools run by churches) learn the law of church and state from ap-
pellate opinions issued by federal courts and essays written by law pro-
fessors who are or who pretend to be agnostic on questions of theology.
In this way, law students are trained to look at the church as an intrusive
subculture. They are trained to look at faith as if the critical issue were
how much religious eccentricity American democracy can tolerate. The
principal constitutional cases involve Jehovah’s Witnesses, Anabaptists,
Orthodox Jews, and Mormons. The parties to these cases are sectarian,
in both the popular and theological senses of the word: They are oddballs.

“Because of this pedagogical bias in our teachers and our books, we
lawyers look at the community of the faithful—even when it is our own
community —as if it were outside of our lives as lawyers. And not only
outside but also consequent on our lives as lawyers. We lawyers come to
act as if attention to the community of the faithful is legitimate only when
the state approves of our giving attention to it. It is as if our political found-
ing fathers gathered our ancestors together and set up a legal order, and
then the church came along to torment and test their creation.”

Herreshoff recognized
as leading artist

 

 

 

 

 

Louise Herreshoff, whose paint-
ings are permanently displayed in
Washington and Lee’s Reeves
Center, has received new recog-
nition as an outstanding Ameri-
can artist.

In his three-volume book, Art
Across America, art historian William
H. Gerdts calls Herreshoff “a
leader of Post-Impressionism in
America.”

When Herreshoff and her hus-
band, Euchlin D. Reeves, ’27L,
died in 1967, they left Washington
and Lee an extensive collection of
porcelain dating from the 18th cen-
tury to the early 20th century. The
collection is now housed on the
campus in the Reeves Center.

Honors, awards

A Washington and Lee student
and a 1990 graduate have recently
received special recognition.

e Rachael M. Easton, '92, a
chemistry major from Plano,
Texas, has been named a 1990
Scholar by the Barry M. Goldwater
Scholarship and Excellence in
Education Foundation.

She is the first Washington and
Lee student ever to receive a
Goldwater scholarship. The U.S.
Congress created the scholarship
program to foster and encourage
excellence in science and
mathematics.

Easton is a member of Chi
Omega sorority and the Student
Activities Board. She has also par-
ticipated in the Robert E. Lee

32 WOE

It was only after her death that
Herreshoff was “discovered” as an
artist. Born in 1876, she studied art
first in Rhode Island and then in
France at the turn of the century.
For unknown reasons, she quit
painting in 1927 and then stored
the works in the attic of her home.

The paintings were undisturbed
until 1967, when movers who ar-
rived to transport the porcelain to
Washington and Lee uncovered a
group of frames, dusty from 40
years of storage.

Some of the paintings have since
been on display in the Corcoran
Gallery of Art and the National
Museum of Women in the Arts.

In his book, art historian Gerdts
describes Herreshoffs French
works as “remarkably evocative,
poetic renderings of women. Even
more astounding, however, is the
work she began to do when she
returned to Providence in 1911,
after almost a decade in New
York City.”

He continues, “In the figures,
landscapes, and especially the floral
still lifes she painted, Herreshoff
adopted a blazing palette of un-
modulated colors applied in thick
brush strokes. The results recall
the work of Fauves such as Henri
Matisse and certainly mark her not
only as the most avant-garde of
Providence artists, but as a leader
of Post-Impressionism in America.”

“Pink Azaleas” is one of the Herreshoff paintings that belong to Washington and Lee.

James W. Whitehead, director of
the Reeves Center, is pleased with
the recent recognition Herreshoff
has received.

“Her increasing importance as an
American painter has encouraged
W&L students to use our

His winning paper, which was
based on his Washington and Lee
honors thesis, was titled “Of Crime

papers Report Rape Complainants’
Names?” The paper will be pub-
lished in an upcoming issue of the
Journal of Mass Media Ethics.

During his years at W&L, Lake
was a staff member of the campus
radio and television stations and
the Ring-tum Phi.

This marks the second year in
a row that a Washington and Lee
graduate has won the Burnett com-
petition. The previous year, Marie
Dunne White, ’89, received first
place for her paper on plagiarism.

her life, and into that period of
American art,” he says.

“Few American women artists of
that period have been recognized,
nationally or internationally, for
their contributions.”

Dedication Delayed
for Lenfest Center

Because of delays in the con-
struction schedule, the dedication
of Washington and Lee’s Lenfest
Center for the Performing Arts has
been rescheduled.

The ceremony was originally to
be held on Jan. 19, 1991—Robert
E. Lee’s birthday. Instead, the
event will occur May 23-25 and
will coincide with the regular spring
meeting of the Board of Trustees.

Despite the delays, several per-
formances will take place in the
Lenfest Center during the winter
months. They will include a con-
cert conducted by choral director
Robert Shaw and a performance
of Thornton Wilders Shin of
Our Teeth.

Patricia Lopes, 91, is Washington and Lee’s 14th Rhodes Scholar

Patricia Lopes, a senior from
Kailua, Hawaii, has received a
Rhodes scholarship.

Lopes is one of 32 students from
across the country awarded the
prestigious scholarship for two
years study at England’s Oxford
University. She will study politics,
philosophy, and economics at
Oxford.

Lopes is Washington and Lee’s
14th Rhodes scholar and the first

since John Vlahoplus received the
honor in 1983. W&L President
John D. Wilson was a Rhodes
scholar from Michigan State
University.

The Rhodes scholars, who were
selected in early December, are
chosen on a regional basis from
across the United States. The can-
didates are judged on intellectual
achievement, character, leadership,
and physical vigor.

Lopes is majoring in politics and
journalism. She is a member of Phi
Eta Sigma, the freshman honor
society, and Omicron Delta Kap-
pa, the national leadership frater-
nity founded at W&L.

She is coeditor of the Ring-tum
Phi, chairwoman of the student
publications board, and a four-year
letter-winner on the women’s cross
country team. She has also served
as a dormitory counselor and resi-

dent assistant.

Last summer, Lopes was an in-
tern reporter for the Honolulu Szar-
Bulletin. She has worked as a legis-
lative intern in the Washington,
D.C., office of Sen. Daniel Inouye
and as a workshop instructor for
educational television with Hawaii's
Department of Education.

More information about Lopes
and the Rhodes scholarship will ap-
pear in a future issue of W@L.

Professor Clark Mollenhoff helps rewrite history of modern technology

Clark R. Mollenhoff, professor of
journalism at Washington and Lee,
has helped rewrite the history of
modern technology.

For decades, the wrong scientist
has been receiving credit for in-
venting the first computer—
probably the most significant in-
vention of the 20th century. Now,
Mollenhoff has set the record
straight.

After years of litigation, a 1973
court ruling named John Vincent
Atanasoff the rightful creator of the
first computer. But the ruling
received so little public attention
at the time that the fact was never
corrected in textbooks, ency-
clopedias, or even that bastion of
historical research, the Smithso-
nian Institution.

As late as 1989, these reference
materials were still claiming that
John Mauchly, not Atanasoff, built
the first computer.

But last November, Atanasoff
finally received the public recogni-
tion he deserved. During a
ceremony at the White House,
President George Bush presented
the 87-year-old inventor with a
Presidential Medal of Technology.

Atanasoff gives much of the
credit for his recent honors to Clark
Mollenhoff and his 1988 book,
Atanasoff—Forgotten Father of the
Computer.

The book explains that in 1939,
when Atanasoff was professor of
mathematics and physics at lowa
State College, he and a graduate
student named Clifford Berry con-
structed the first electronic digital
computer.

In 1941 John Mauchly, an in-
structor at Ursinus College in
Pennsylvania, visited Atanasoff for
several days. He saw the computer
and read the document explaining
its operation and construction.

After returning to Pennsylvania,
Mauchly used Atanasoffs basic

computer concepts to draw up the
plans for ENIAC, which has been

described as the first general pur-
pose electronic digital computer.

In 1973, a U.S. District Court
ruled that Mauchly and his co-
inventor, electronics expert
Presper Eckert, “did not them-
selves first invent the automatic
electronic digital computer, but in-
stead derived that subject mat-
ter from one Dr. John Vincent

Atanasoff.”

Mollenhoff became interested in
Atanasoffs story when he was
working as Washington bureau
chief for the Des Moines Register. He
visited Atanasoff for the first time
in 1973, although his book was not
published for another 15 years.

Mollenhoff joined Washington
and Lee’s faculty in 1976.

W&L faculty, staff visit alumni chapters

Members of Washington and
Lee’s faculty and administration
took advantage of beautiful fall
weather this year to travel to
alumni chapters across the country.

W&L President John D. Wilson
and James D. Farrar Jr., °74, direc-
tor of alumni programs, paid a visit
to Baltimore alumni in_ late
September. Earlier in the month,
Farrar had also met with members
of the Cleveland and Detroit
chapters.

Robert W. H. Mish, ’76, assis-
tant alumni director, and Joel P.
Smith Jr., °90, alumni staff
associate, attended a fall reception
given by the Connecticut River
Valley chapter, while Professors
John F. DeVogt, Roger A. Dean,
and Lawrence M. Lamont of the
Commerce School spoke to the
Atlanta chapter.

Another member of the Com-
merce School faculty—Bruce H.
Herrick, John F. Hendon professor

34. W&L

of economics—delivered a talk on
European unification and the U.S.
economy during the Richmond
chapter’s fall luncheon.

Farrar and David R. Long,
W&L’s director of planned giving,
visited the Kansas and Tulsa
chapters in late October. Farrar
also accompanied JubiLee, one of
W&L’s singing ensembles, during
a performance for the Chat-
tanooga chapter.

Timothy G. McMahon, ‘87,
director of the Annual Fund, and
Anne B. Coulling, University
editor, were the guests at a recep-
tion sponsored by the Northern
New Jersey chapter.

During a reception honoring pro-
spective students, Shawn A.
Copeland, 90, an admissions
counselor at W&L, met with
members of the New Orleans
chapter. The reception was held at
the home of Michelle and Joe Car-
rere, ‘77.

Spectator sports

Sporting events also provided a
good excuse for alumni to get
together during the fall. W&L
graduates in Atlanta honored
members of the Generals’ soccer
and tennis teams during their con-
tests with Emory University in late
September.

Meanwhile, members of the
Eastern Kentucky chapter sup-
ported the Generals during their
annual football game with Centre
College.

Other chapter events

The Tidewater chapter held its
annual oyster roast in late October.
Alumni in Sarasota sponsored a
cocktail reception, and members of
the Washington, D.C., chapter
gathered with graduates of other
Virginia colleges for the fifth annual
“Party in the Park.”

When they weren't cheering for
Washington and Lee teams, alumni
found time to watch other sporting
events, as well. The San Fran-
cisco chapter watched the
Oakland A’s take on the Detroit
Tigers in late September, while fur-
ther south in San Diego, alumni
gathered with graduates of other
East Coast schools to see polo
matches.

The Philadelphia chapter
sponsored a _ luncheon with
alumnae of Mary Baldwin College.
Their speaker was Sarah W.
Hargrove, secretary of banking for
Pennsylvania and a Mary Baldwin
graduate.

X Poems
by Daniel Weeks, ’80
(Blast Press)

This is the first extended collection of poems by Weeks, whose works
have appeared in small press magazines across the country.

“The poems included in X Poems are quite different from the main
body of my work,” Weeks says. “They are more experimental and adven-
turous, perhaps even shocking to a certain degree.”

The first section of the book contains poems “whose themes were
suggested in dreams,” he says. In the second group, he tried to effect
“a hard, almost crystalline tone indicative of my early style.”

The third is titled “Improvisations.” Weeks is the coleader and drum-
mer of the jazz group Jazzlamic Jihad and says jazz is a pervasive in-
fluence in his poetry.

Weeks is editor of college publications at Monmouth College in West
Long Branch, N.J.

Developing CEOs

The Washington and Lee Way

A recent study by Fortune magazine reveals that Washington
and Lee is one of the best training grounds in the nation for chief
executive officers.

In a survey of nearly 1,500 top executives of Fortune 500 and
Service 500 companies, W&L was ranked third in producing
CEOs on a per capita basis.

“Relatively speaking, tiny Washington and
Lee of Lexington, Va., has launched more
alumni toward the corner office than mighty
Harvard,” the Fortune story says.

The University’s high ranking is based on
what Fortune calls its “Power Factor,” which
takes the average size of the institutions’
graduating classes and calculates the percentage
accounted for by CEOs.

“By this measure,” the magazine says, “Yale
and Princeton kept the No. 1 and No. 2 spots,
but Washington and Lee, a private liberal arts
university, vaulted past all other contenders.”

Five W&L alumni are among the CEOs in-
cluded in the Fortune survey. They are Charles
W. Cole Jr., 59, CEO of First Maryland Ban-
corp; J. Carter Fox, 61, president, CEO, and director of
Chesapeake Corp. in Richmond; Henry H. Harrell, ’61, presi-
dent, CEO, and director of Universal Corp. in Richmond; Robert
Van Buren, ’50, chairman, CEO, and director of Midlantic Corp.
in Edison, N.J.; and Robert A. Young III, 63, president, CEO,
and director of Arkansas Best Corp. in Fort Smith, Ark.

What accounts for W&L’s high ranking? Larry C. Peppers,
dean of W&L’s School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics,
says there’s no “precise formula for the development of a CEO.”
Nonetheless, Peppers adds, Washington and Lee does enjoy a
“wonderful record in developing business leaders. The Universi-
ty Ss mission statement ‘stresses the importance of the individual,
personal honor and integrity, . . .and the responsibility to serve
society. .. .’ These are precisely the attributes needed by cor-
porate America.”

‘The CEOs themselves seem to agree. “The liberal arts educa-
tion one gets at Washington and Lee is the best foundation for
the manager of the future,” Fox believes.

Fox himself is a case in point. He majored in physics-
engineering at W&L, although he was only a few credits short
of a major in industrial management. His science background
prepared him well for a career in a paper company, he says: “I
can't actually make the paper or operate the machinery, but I can
understand how the process works. I can read blueprints and make
sense of what an engineer is telling me. That might not have been
possible without my Washington and Lee background.”

Fox grew up in Aylett, Va., not far from Richmond, and at-
tended Woodberry Forest School. He decided to attend W&L,
he says, because “the people I met were friendly, and I knew it
was a good school.”

 

He became involved in various aspects of campus life at
Washington and Lee, serving as president of his class and as vice
president of Kappa Alpha fraternity, representing KA on the In-
terfraternity Council, and writing for the Ring-tum Phi. He was
also a member of the rifle team.

After graduation he earned a master of business administra-
tion degree from the University of Virginia and
then went to work for Chesapeake Corp. as a
project accountant. That was in 1963, and he
has been with the company ever since: work-
ing his way up to controller, vice president, and
finally president and chief executive officer.

When Fox joined Chesapeake, the company
did $25 million worth of business each year.
Today, the annual figure is $850 million.
Witnessing that growth has been one of the
greatest rewards of his career. “I have also en-
joyed working with the people I’ve known,” he
adds. “The company was small when I started,
and [ got to know many people early on.”

In addition to his work with Chesapeake,
Fox has been involved with numerous business
and civic organizations. He is a director of American Paper In-
stitute and Crestar Financial Corp., a sponsor trustee of the
University of Virginia’s Darden School, a member of the Gover-
nors Economic Advisory Council in Virginia, chairman of the
Virginia Business Council, and a trustee of the Virginia Founda-
tion for Independent Colleges.

He also served as chairman of W&L’s Annual Fund from 1975
to 1977. He is an honorary member of Omicron Delta Kappa,
the national leadership fraternity founded at W&L.

In 1962 Fox married Carol Spaulding, a graduate of Hollins
College. They have three children: Faulkner, 27; Lucy, 23; and
Baylor, 17.

Fox believes his education prepared him well for his career,
and he would encourage students today to follow a similar course.
He advises them to “study a lot of English and communications.
Try to get your written and verbal communications skills
developed thoroughly. I have known so many people who have
brilliant ideas and just can’t communicate them.

“Study plenty of geography and history,” he continues. “The
world is becoming smaller, and we will all have to deal with peo-
ple of different ethnic and national backgrounds. We need to know
the history of those people as business becomes more global.

“Accounting and business courses are basic, but the liberal
arts are important, too. You may be at a disadvantage your first
five or 10 years out of school, but the liberal arts people will catch
up with and even surpass those with a specialized background.

“In other words,” he concludes, “don’t spend all your time
in the Commerce School.”

Future issues of W&L will contain profiles of the other alumni
included in the Fortune survey.

Two of the students who examined black lung legislation with Uncas McThenia (center) are Peter Katt, ’91L (left), and Charles Hoffman, ’91L.

DISEASE OF THE MINES

Law students examine black lung

There they were—“W&L’s finest,” as
their professor termed them, dressed in
blue jeans and eating dinner with dissi-
dent union activists in Camp Solidarity,
a United Mine Workers strike support
camp deep in the heart of the coalfields
of Southwest Virginia.

More precisely, they were 16 second-
and third-year W&L law students en-
rolled in a seminar on black lung legisla-
tion. The class, taught by Professor
A. W. (Uncas) McThenia, 58, *62L, is
one of several courses that Washington
and Lee’s School of Law has developed
to expose future attorneys and perhaps
future legislative decision-makers to peo-
ple who have been traditionally left out
or left behind by America’s legal system.

The interactions which often take
place in the unique environment of a

 

hese nc ee

38 =W&L

by Lisa Rogers, ’91L

realistic clinical experience help to shape
the perspectives of the law students and
to lessen the mistrust of those who often
feel the brunt of the law but seldom
receive its benefits.

‘The students enrolled in the seminar
had many varied life experiences which
they shared to educate each other more
fully about the general topics of
Coal Worker’s Pneumoconiosis (CWP)
and black lung legislation. For example,
two members of the group, natives of the
Appalachian region, have relatives af-
flicted by black lung.

Another, Dr. Preston Mayson, is a
radiologist embarking on a second career
as an attorney. A fourth, Susan Swecker,
has been a political campaign manager
and actively involved in Virginia politics.

This diverse collection of soon-to-be

 

legislation

lawyers spent the 1990 spring semester
attempting to unravel the complexities of
the federal compensation program de-
signed to aid miners suffering from CWP.

“Black lung” or CWP is a progressive
and debilitating disease which results
from the accumulation of coal dust in the
pulmonary tissue of mine workers. It is
commonly termed “black lung” because
those two words most vividly describe the
condition of the lungs of deceased
coal miners.

Although the seminar had been ex-
plained in the course catalog as an ex-
ploration of federal black lung legislation,
the students spent the first several weeks
of the term reading about the history of
the coal industry, the economics and
sociocultural patterns of the Appalachian
region, and the medical aspects of CWP.

Their basic texts included John
Gaventa’s Power and Powerlessness, Ron
Eller’s Miners, Mill Hands, and Moun-
taineers, and various economic develop-
ment reports about Southwest Virginia
which were prepared by the University
of Virginia and Virginia Tech.

Under McThenia’s supervision, the
students worked both as individuals and
as teams to research the complicated legal
issues concerning the Department of
Labor’s black lung program—a compen-
sation plan now so restrictive that only
two to four percent of all claimants are
awarded benefits.

This extremely low approval rate is
coupled with a time-consuming and
backlogged appellate claims review pro-
cess. As a result, severely disabled miners
often must wait for years or even a decade
before they finally learn whether their ap-
plications for benefits have been
approved.

As part of its background investiga-
tion, the group traveled to several coun-
ties in Virginia and Tennessee, where
they interviewed physicians, disabled
miners, black lung activists, coal industry
lawyers, claimant’s attorneys, and
UMWA representatives. Throughout
their weekend field trip in March, the law
students learned their lessons from
people-to-people encounters and were ex-
posed to many situations impossible to
duplicate in the classroom.

First, they met with Dr. Joe Frank
Smiddy in Kingsport, Tenn., for a three-
hour minicourse on the medical diagnosis
and evaluation of CWP. Later they
crisscrossed the cold and wet Appalachian
plateau (in vans borrowed from W&L’s
geology department) to meet for dinner
and conversation with union miners,
“company” men, and black lung activists
at Grace House, an Episcopal Church
education center.

The following day, the group divided
into pairs and threesomes to visit with
disabled miners in their homes in small
towns such as Dante, Trammel, and
Martintown in Dickinson County.

These meetings were especially poig-
nant, as students became aware of how
severely debilitating black lung can be. Its
victims are frequently bedridden or
sedentary because even the slightest
physical exertion—such as moving from
a chair in one room to a bed in another—

can make the simple act of breathing a
labored and painful effort.

The miner hosts took some of their
visitors to see Moss Three, the coal
preparation plant where much of the
picket-line activity took place during the
recent strike against the Pittston Coal Co.

The students reassembled for sack
lunches at the Client Centered Legal Ser-
vices office in Castlewood, where staff at-
torney Paul Beers, ’86L, explained the
difficulties claimants must overcome to
qualify for black lung benefits.

A coal company lawyer presented the
industry's position—a significant one,
because the DOL’s black lung program
requires compensation for CWP disabili-
ty to be paid either by the responsible
coal operator or from the Black Lung
‘Trust Fund, which is supported by taxes
paid by the coal companies.

Then the students were off to dinner
at Camp Solidarity, which has become an
international shrine to workers following
visits by representatives of the Polish
Solidarity movement and by Russian and
South African coal miners. This meal was
prepared especially for the W&L
students by members of the International
Chefs and Restauranteurs’ Union. Even
later that evening, there were additional
meetings with miners and their families.

Both the trip and the course were eye-
openers for the students, who had been
taught to “think like lawyers” in the cozy
and educationally elite confines of Lewis
Hall. In chilly coalfields and in coal-
heated homes, aspiring corporate lawyers
were exposed to disabled miners’ inter-
pretations of the meaning of terms used
in coal company/union contracts and in
various pension agreements.

Around the kitchen table at Grace
House, the students had to respond to
such questions as, “What about the
morals clause in a contract?” The morals
clause? “Yes,” said the questioner, a miner
disabled by CWP, “the part of the con-
tract that says if a man works for a com-
pany for 30 years and then gets black lung
because of the conditions in the com-
pany’ mine, that company has a moral
obligation to help that man and to take
care of him and his family.”

One question. Two or three seconds.
An unforgettable delineation of the chasm
separating those with a legal education
from those without. Those with four

hours of Contracts had never read such
agreements with a “morals clause” in
mind; those without had never read such
an agreement otherwise.

Perhaps the greatest lesson for the law
students was realizing the magnitude of
the problem. There is no “quick fix” or
simple way amenably to align economic
and industrial realities with equally press-
ing social welfare needs.

Early in the semester, the students
had read two diametrically opposed ac-
counts of the black lung legislation pro-
gram. The Tragedy of Black Lung by Peter
Barth describes the compensation pro-
gram as a wasteful disaster. On the other
hand, Barbara Smith’s Digging Our Own
Graves argues that the black lung program
was an example of progressive social
legislation subsequently decimated by
restrictive interpretations and congres-
sional amendments.

As the seminar progressed, the par-
ticipants found no easy answers for the
many problems associated with this pro-
gram, which remains controversial even
in the coalfields. But the personal ex-
perience of interacting one on one with
individuals representing the polar posi-
tions of this socioeconomic dilemma had
a deep impact on all of the students.

There are no totally right or totally
wrong viewpoints and no simple solu-
tions. When it comes to black lung
benefits, the miners, who are often
desperately ill, are in dire need of the
compensation to which they feel entitled
after years of service in the mines—mines
where their own efforts created the dust
that now clogs their lungs.

In today’s economic environment, the
coal industry asserts that it cannot pick
up the tab for what it perceives may be
a “thinly disguised retirement program,”
while simultaneously trying to improve
safety conditions in the mines.

The seminar produced several
thought-provoking papers about this com-
plex compensation program. Some of the
students’ reports were incorporated into
testimony offered during a hearing of the
Subcommittee on Labor Standards of the
U.S. House of Representatives in April.
In addition, Congressman Chris Perkins
of Kentucky requested copies of the
students’ reports, which are also sched-
uled to be submitted to a Congressional
hearing in Washington, D.C.

The Generals Report

BY MIKE STACHURA, ‘86

 

To paraphrase a famous advertising
slogan, Washington and Lee's athletic
teams have come a long way. ..

 

Take the women’s
program, for instance.
It was just five au-
tumns ago that women
arrived at W&L and
encountered any num-
ber of challenges—not
the least of which were
on the fields of play.

W&L’s women’s
teams often struggled
in those early days,
and every year was
called “a building year.”

But in the fall of
1990, the patience of
the women athletes
and their coaches final-
ly paid off.

W&L’s first inter-
collegiate event for
women was cross
country. Though the
numbers were small
that first year, the team
competed and eventually recorded the first victory by any
W&L women’s team. This fall, the W&L women com-
pleted their climb to the top, winning the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference title on the strength of their num-
bers and their collective grit.

In soccer, the W&L women’s program had started very
nearly overnight. The first time a W&L player put the
ball in the net, it unfortunately was into her own. From
those humble beginnings, however, the Generals started
to make their way, finishing fourth in the ODAC one year
and reaching the ODAC semifinals the next year. This
fall, the Generals put together their best season ever,
established themselves as one of the region’s hottest young
teams, and were just a penalty kick away from being the
best team in the league.

The progress of
women’s volleyball at
W&L has been equal-
ly impressive. Each
year the team grew
stronger and stronger,
and this fall, the Gen-
erals came within a few
points of knocking

rae wt’ aI off eventual ODAC

oe ORs champion Eastern
Mennonite.

W&L ended the

year third in the

ODAC standings, its
best finish ever.

And while all the
W&L women’s teams
were showing every-
one the progress they
had made in five short
years, Washington and
Lee head football
coach Gary Fallon was
watching his Generals
go from 1-4 and down-and-out to 5-5 and on top of the
world by season’s finish.

W&L’s teams began the year with uncertainty. But
in the end, they surprised their opponents, their fans, and
even themselves.

They had, indeed, come a long way.

FOOTBALL

Heartbreak and frustration marked the first five games
of the season. Triumph and jubilation characterized the
second half, however, as Fallon’s troops surged to four
wins in their final five games. It was the second time in
the last three years a Fallon team had turned its season
around in the second half, and this year’s comeback

ae Fy

Taare, Tastee

   

    

ord with nine goals this

featured upset victories over an-

 

 

nual rivals Hampden-Sydney,
Sewanee, and Georgetown.

But before the comeback
there was heartbreak, and nothing
broke more hearts than Game 1.
W&L’s annual opening day tus-
sle with ODAC power Emory
and Henry started as it usually
does: with the Wasps taking a big
lead. But after falling behind 14-0,
the Generals scored two field
goals and were back in the game.

Then George Sakin, who was
making his first college start at
quarterback, threw two touch-
down passes in a five-minute span
in the fourth quarter. The last
one, a 46-yard bomb to speedy
junior slotback Jeff Kreis, gave the
Generals a 21-14 lead and had a
Hall of Fame crowd at Wilson
Field stomping their feet to the
“W&L Swing.” When defensive
end John McCallum recovered a
Wasp fumble at the W&L
19-yard line with 90 seconds left
to play, the Generals appeared to
be on their way to their first win
over E&H since 1982.

Enter heartbreak and frustration.

After three plays left W&L on its own
18, the Generals elected to take a safety
rather than risk a blocked punt with 37
seconds to play. The Wasps took the en-
suing free kick and drove to the W&L
26-yard line. On the game’s final play
Emory and Henry scored to earn the
shocking 22-21 victory.

W&L recovered from that defeat with
a sluggish win over Methodist, but the ef-
fect of the E&H game lingered over the
next three weeks, when the Generals
came up short against Centre, Randolph-
Macon, and Maryville. The losses left
W&L at 1-4 and assured that the
Generals would go through the rest of the
season as underdogs nearly every week.

Fallon set out to end the losing skid
by making some changes. The most
notable of those was at quarterback,
where junior Fred Renneker, who had
played three games at defensive back,
took over the starting role.

His first time at quarterback, Ren-
neker passed for one score and ran for
two more on Homecoming Saturday,

leading the Generals to their first win over
arch-rival Hampden-Sydney since 1985.
The W&L defense asserted itself again
the following week in a 17-0 win over
Sewanee, who came into the contest
allowing opponents an average of just 6.5
points per game.

The Generals suffered a setback at
Bridgewater when the Eagles rushed for
380 yards and held W&L to only 149
yards in total offense. But the following
week, W&L handed Guilford a surpris-
ing 28-22 defeat on Parents’ Weekend at
Wilson Field. The Quakers had beaten
every other ODAC team they had played
and brought a high-powered offensive
machine to Lexington. But Renneker,
who amassed 210 yards of total offense,
kept the Guilford offense on the bench,
and the W&L defense forced five tur-
novers to preserve the win.

The season ended much more hap-
pily than it began, as the Generals’
defense dominated Georgetown. W&L
scored 21 second-half points and held the
Hoyas to 174 yards in total offense. It was
the 10th time in Fallon’s 13 years that his

W&L's Mark Goglia picks his way to eight of his career
high 91 yards in the Generals’ 21-6 final game victory
over Georgetown.

team finished the season with a
victory.

At season’s end, senior split
end Craig Irons, who finished sec-
ond at W&L in career receptions,
was named first-team All-ODAC
for the second year in a row.
Other first-team selections were
center Frank Sudell, a four-year
starter at Center, and senior strong
safety Brad Miller, who led W&L
with six interceptions this season
and finished with 11 for his col-
lege career.

Named to the second team
were sophomore punter Bob
Ehret, senior placekicker Carter
Quayle, senior offensive linemen
Rob Roberton and Rob Chris-
tensen, senior running back
Mason Pope, sophomore defen-
sive linemen Phil Spears and
Thomas May, and junior
linebacker ‘Trey Cox.

WOMEN'S SOCCER

When she began the 1990
season, W&L head coach Jan
Hathorn knew her team had plen-

ty of talent. In fact, Hathorn had so much
confidence in her players that she set an
ambitious goal for them—to become
serious contenders for the league title.

By season’s end, the mission was
successful.

The Generals set six new team single-
season records and broke three individual
records on their way to the best year in
the history of the program. W&L’s 11-6
record included first-ever wins over
league powers Randolph-Macon and
Lynchburg and a five-game winning
streak in mid-season that propelled the
Generals to a third-place finish in the
regular season.

Youngsters led the Generals as
freshman Karen Stutzmann established a
new single-season record for goals with
10, and classmate Kate Stimeling was the
ODAC’s top goalkeeper, allowing an
average of less than one goal a game and
tying a school record with eight shutouts
during the season.

The W&L women proved they were
indeed contenders by plowing through
their ODAC quarterfinal and semifinal

 

 

W&L 41

games. Included in the demolition was a
4-1 semifinal shellacking of second-
seeded Randolph-Macon, a team that
never before had been stopped short of
the championship game.

The wins set up a championship
matchup with Roanoke, the league's
premier team, which was ranked in the
nation’s top 20. What ensued was an un-
forgettable soccer exhibition that lasted
through four overtimes and wasn’t decid-
ed until Roanoke scored on the 13th
sudden-death penalty kick, ending the
three-and-a-half hour game.

Defensive stalwart Nancy Mitchell
was named first-team all-conference for
the second year in a row, and she was
joined on the first team by Stutzmann.
Junior Ashley Hurt, another key to the
W&L defense, was named to the All-
ODAC second team. Mitchell also was
a second-team All-South selection, mak-
ing her the firsts W&L women’s soccer
player to earn that honor.

CROSS COUNTRY

While the women and their cham-
pionship season may have been the star
attractions in cross country this fall, the
men’s team wasn’t a bad opening act.

The men pushed regional power
Lynchburg in the ODAC Champion-
ships, coming within a few points of
upsetting the Hornets for the ODAC
title. W&L posted its best men’s record
since 1986, and for the first time in four
years, three Generals—sophomore Bo
Hannah and juniors Charles Edwards and
David Martin—were named to the All-
ODAC team. The men went on to finish
sixth at the NCAA Division III
South/Southeast Regional meet, and Ed-
wards and Hannah were named to the all-
region team.

But the women provided the real
fireworks. The Generals put together the
deepest team in the league this year.
Eight different runners scored in meets
during the season, and that depth paid off
at the ODAC Championships. The
Generals defeated the three-time defend-
ing league champions by just two points,
and the margin of victory was preserved
when W&L placed seven runners in the
top 18 to Eastern Mennonite’s five.

Leading the way for the Generals was
sophomore Susie Wootton, who finished
sixth overall at the ODAC meet, and
senior Cecily Tynan, who was seventh.

Both Wootton and Tynan were named to
the All-LODAC team. The W&L women

went on to record their best performance
ever at regionals by finishing sixth.

VOLLEYBALL

Though the Generals finished just a
notch below .500, the 1990 season was
anything but marginally successful.
W&L’s 16 wins were the most recorded
in a season by a W&L team. The
Generals also attained their best finish
ever in ODAC play, closing the regular
season as third in the conference.

While the year had its usual supply of
ups and downs, there was perhaps no
more dramatic moment than the
Generals’ late-season duel with eventual
ODAC champion Eastern Mennonite.
W&L held a 2-1 edge in games and were
within four points of pulling off the upset
before the Lady Royals rallied for
the win.

The Generals ended up the year by
finishing fourth in the ODAC ‘Tourna-
ment. They advanced to the semifinal
round by defeating Sweet Briar, but fell
to runner-up Bridgewater in the semifinals
and to Roanoke in the consolation match.

W&L’s cocaptains Lisa Jay, a senior,
and Mena McGowin, a junior, were both
named to the all-ODAC team (Jay to the

WATER POLO

Though the Generals failed to qualify
for the Eastern Championships for the
first time since 1977, their performance
was nonetheless impressive during a dif-
ficult rebuilding year.

That process of rebuilding was made
all the more difficult when one of the key
players, sophomore goalie P. J. Waicus,
went down in mid-season with an injury
that kept him out the rest of the year. Up
to that point, the Generals appeared to
be putting the right pieces together. In
racing to an 8-1 start, W&L had record-
ed important wins over Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology and Dayton, and
the Generals had beaten arch-rival Rich-
mond twice, including a four-overtime
victory in the state championship game.

But then Waicus was injured, and the
team had to reorganize once again. W&L
ended the year by finishing third in the
Southern Championships.

Field players Tomas Perez, a senior,
and Alan Herrick, a junior, were named
to the all-conference team, with Perez

garnering first-team honors and Herrick
earning second-team laurels. Perez, who
also was named most valuable player of
the state championships, and junior Will
Davis were selected to the all-state team.

MEN'S SOCCER

One of the most difficult tasks in
sports is repeating a championship
season. The young W&L men’s soccer
team learned that the hard way when they
struggled through a 7-8-2 season in 1990
after winning the ODAC title the

 

previous year.

W&L started the season by winning
its first two games and was ranked as high
as seventh in the region before a six-game
winless spell took the wind out of the
Generals’ sails. W&L rebounded from
the slump to win three straight con-
ference games before suffering a 2-1 over-
time setback at the hands of eventual
ODAC champion Virginia Wesleyan.

The Generals reached the semifinals
of the ODAC Tournament by outlasting
Hampden-Sydney in an overtime win in
the quarterfinals. W&L, forced to play
the final 40 minutes of that game a man
down, got the game-winner from junior
captain David Hooker. In the semifinals
W&L again ran into Virginia Wesleyan,
and the Marlins, who finished the regular
season unbeaten, eliminated W&L by a
3-0 count. The Generals ended the year
by defeating VMI for the city
championship.

Four W&L players were named to
the All-ODAC team. They were led by
sophomore forward Reid Murphy, the
team’s leading scorer, who was a first
team selection. Sweeper back Greg
Williams joined Murphy on the first team,
while Hooker and sophomore Mike Mit-
chem were second-team picks.

A Sound Estate Plan

 

gnorance of the estate tax laws can create a very

difficult situation for your heirs, particularly if

you fail to use charitable gifts as an important
component of your plan. | offer below a real-life
example of an $8 million estate, a portion of which
was bequeathed to Washington and Lee
University.

The donor was an elderly alumnus, widowed,
with three surviving children. A very philanthropic
man, the donor provided handsomely for a host
of charitable organizations, his intent being to
divide the remainder of his estate among his
children. As the following example illustrates, even
with a philanthropic component to your estate
plan, it is extremely difficult to pass wealth to heirs
without the imposition of a massive tax upon your
estate prior to the distribution of assets to your
children.

Gross Estate $8,000,000
Cost of Administering Estate 500,000
Charitable Bequests 2,500,000
Adjusted Gross Estate 5,000,000
Estate Tax Due 2,250,000
Estate Divided Among Children 2,750,000

W&L

lf the donor had provided for his children’s
financial welfare through a series of charitable re-
mainder trusts, making a gift of life-income from
assets valued at $5,000,000, the result would be
quite different. These trusts could have been
established through his will.

Gross Estate $8,000,000
Cost of Administering Estate 500,000
Charitable Bequests 2,500,000
Charitable Remainder Trusts 5,000,000

providing a life income for the children with W&L

receiving the assets remaining at the time of the death

of last surviving child.
Adjusted Gross Estate
Estate Tax Due

Dramatically Reduced
Minimal
The key to this alternative plan is to make a
gift of life-income to the children using the assets
constituting your estate rather than to provide for
direct receipt of the assets themselves.
lf you’d like to learn more about ways to in-
vest in the University’s future while minimizing
the tax burden that might be levied against your

estate, please call me at (703) 463-8425.

James Head, ’64, helps direct
NASA mission to Venus

James W. Head III, ‘64, signed up for his first geology course at Washington
and Lee because he “knew all the labs would be outdoors.”

Years later, Head has found new meaning for the term ‘‘outdoor labs.”
Much of his research today occurs in the great outdoors—in space.

Head teaches geo-
sity. But he’s also done

working for NASA
year’s sabbatical leave

from Brown and is working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,
where he is a project scientist for the Magellan spacecraft’s mission to Venus.

The Magellan was actually launched in May 1989. It wasn’t until
September of this year that the spacecraft began transmitting pictures of Venus
back to the earth. But Head says it was worth the wait.

“The images are stunning,” he says. ‘They are 10 times more clear than
anything we’ve previously seen of Venus. It’s as though you are looking at
a planet the size of the earth and you have stripped off all the oceans. It’s
really exciting.”

Because the temperature of Venus’s surface is 800 degrees Fahrenheit,
Head explains, water cannot exist on the planet. There is no rain to cause
erosion, so the surface is strikingly ‘‘pristine.”’

“We get so used to seeing erosion on the earth that we don’t even think
about it,”” says Head, who has also done research on various regions of the
earth. “Venus, on the other hand, hasn’t really changed in millions of years.”

Too, the atmosphere of Venus is five times as thick as the earth’s, so the
surface is largely protected from meteorites. Meteorites which would cause
real damage to the earth simply burn up in Venus’s thick atmosphere.

Still, the planet does have some unusual features. A number of large im-
pact craters exist, and Head and his colleagues have named a cluster of these
the “Crater Farm.” The pictures have also revealed fracture patterns, lava flows,
and volcanoes that look much like those found in Hawaii.

The Magellan mission has run smoothly, Head says, and the members of
the project team are pleased. ‘We've had a few problems, but it’s a complex
spacecraft. It’s not easy to get to Venus.”

So far, the scientists in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory have seen only a small
portion of Venus’s surface. Magellan will remain in orbit until the late spring
of 1991, so Head anticipates more surprises.

‘During the next few months, we should be able to get a more global
view,” he Says. “This will be the first time we are able to explore Venus
systematically. Every day, there is something new.

“It’s incredible, and it has exceeded everyone’s expectations.”

Bruce Kramer, ’66,
Defends the Constitution

When the Daughters of the
American Revolution called and
asked Bruce Kramer, ’66, to speak to

one of their meetings, he thought they

were joking.

Kramer is Tennessee’s general
counsel for the American Civil Liber-
ties Union—the infamous organiza-
tion that was attacked during the
1988 presidential campaign for
defending Nazis and opposing school
prayer. The DAR, Kramer thought,
would hardly be the most sympathetic
audience.

Still, once he realized the invita-
tion was sincere, Kramer says he ‘‘felt
honored.”” He attended the meeting,
gave his speech, and promptly re-
ceived a standing ovation.

What happened? Perhaps, Kramer
believes, the DAR and the ACLU
aren’t so different after all.

“Both organizations are dedicated
to preserving the Constitution and the
constitutional form of government,”’
he explains. ‘‘And both are
misunderstood.’

The ACLU, Kramer maintains, is
not the radical, leftist group it’s widely
perceived to be. Indeed, Kramer calls
himself a ‘classical conservative.”

“| don’t believe in big govern-
ment,’”” he says. “I have a healthy
distrust of government. | view the
Constitution as a contract that limits
governmental influence over the
individual. It’s a power-sharing
compact.”’

Kramer, who is a managing part-
ner of an eight-lawyer firm in Mem-
phis, first became involved with the
ACLU 20 years ago because he was
‘interested in constitutional issues.”’
He has served on the organization’s
national board of directors for 14 of
those years and is now a director of

 

 

 

 

the state organization, which has
1,800 members.

Kramer says he learned the impor-
tance of individual freedom and in-
dependence during his years at
Washington and Lee. Although it was
conservative, he explains, the Univer-
sity taught him to develop an open
mind and to tolerate differing
viewpoints.

(His son, Scott, graduated from
Washington and Lee last June. Kramer
and his wife, Lori, also have two
daughters, Missy and Sarah.)

In the future, Kramer hopes that
more Americans will develop an
open mind and learn to appreciate the
mission of the organization he
represents.

‘As a conservative, I’m simply try-
ing to preserve a certain set of
values,’’ he explains, ‘‘the values this
country was founded on.”

W&L 53

And Furthermore

EDITOR:

Thank you for noting in your October 1990
issue the fact that Boyd Williams has retired from
the athletic department at Washington and Lee.
I played just enough football on W&L teams he
helped coach to remember, reading about him
now, how frightening Boyd was, and what a
remarkable influence he was, too.

I always have thought that Boyd went out of
his way to frighten us. He was big, loud, vulgar,
aggressive—what is now called an ‘‘in your face
sort of a guy.’ When you made him mad and he
yelled at you, he blistered the paint on your helmet.
To tell the truth, making him happy was also
dangerous; having him shout his congratulations
and pound you on the back seemed positively life-
threatening.

Boyd fit very awkwardly into the rest of our
experience of W&L. It never seemed to make any
difference to him what our test scores were, or who
belonged to which fraternity, or who had a
beautiful girlfriend. He loved real football and he
loved real football players. He liked the guys who
got the muddiest, the ones who got banged up,
the ones who lost their tempers. And when Boyd
lost his temper people paid attention. I once saw
him drive to tears a big linebacker, a kid he liked
very much, when he thought the kid had cut a
practice. And I saw him in tears himself a few
minutes later, bending over the same kid in the
locker room and apologizing because in fact the
kid’s absence had been excused by another coach
and Boyd hadn’t known.

Come to think of it, those may have been the
only tears I saw at Washington and Lee. We were
all mostly too cool to cry while I was there, too
caught up in learning to be gentlemen ‘‘who could
talk well and wear the graces,’ as someone put
it in a letter you also printed in October. We were
in danger in those days of believing that talking
well and wearing certain graces would be enough
to carry us through life, and that in any case it
was not a good idea to be too pushy or too good
at anything, or too intelligent, or too committed,
or too ambitious. Boyd was certainly different
from what we thought we should be. But I suspect
that the people who did the best at W&L, and who
have done the best since leaving, were the ones who
picked up something like Boyd’s passion and his
strength and who learned to apply themselves to
a goal with the intensity which Boyd brought to
the defensive part of a football game.

Anyway, I look forward to future issues of
your magazine, and | thank you for stirring my
memory the way you do.

EDITOR:

I don’t get it, I just don’t get it. What are these
people talking about? I keep reading these letters
in the alumni magazine that complain about W&L
being such a horrible place, and I just do not know
what these people are talking about. It’s really
making me mad. Why do these alumni insist that
WA&L is a paradise lost? I sat on the Colonnade,

54 W&L

 

I partied on weekends, and I went to Goshen. All
my friends went to Goshen. It really is still there,
guys. And guess what? This only happened a few
months ago.

Jumping from a rock at Goshen in April is
magnificent. The water is cold, too cold to go in
any other way, and the air is warm and humid.
Climbing out you feel alive and exhilarated. Sit-
ting on a rock, relaxing with friends, and watching
the sun go slowly down behind the mountains
make you wish you could lie there forever and wish
the sun would never set.

The grass on the Colonnade is soft and green
and luscious. The white columns blaze down on
you and the lawn stretches far and wide. Frater-
nity brothers play football, sorority girls toss a
frisbee, and dogs wander with the wonderful
aimlessness that only dogs are allowed. It’s easy
to fall asleep here; not even the chiming of the bells
on Lee Chapel can really disturb you. . .except to
send you to class.

I’m sorry Mr. Whipple (‘‘Gone with the
Wind,’’ October 1990) and Mr. Cimmino (‘“‘A
‘Changed’ University,’’ July 1990) feel W&L is
such a terrible place. Mr. Whipple is obviously
ashamed of his school and suggests his classmates
cover for the school in front of associates. I don’t
know your W&L, gentlemen, and I don’t want to
know it. I know my W&L, and I want desperate-
ly to go back there. I graduated in June and it was,
perhaps, my saddest day there. I said good-bye to
some of the best friends I have ever known: frater-
nity brothers, professors, and yes, gentlemen, even
girls.

Of course W&L has changed; only a fool
would expect it not to have changed. Students no
longer wear coats and ties (which is good, consider-
ing how silly all the girls would look) and they no
longer write papers with a quill dipped in ink. In
my four years there, the school changed almost
completely. The last all-male classes left and more
and more girls came—dare I say, invaded the
hallowed halls.

Maybe coeducation was a market-driven fact.
But then, wasn’t all-male education a market-
driven fact when it was created? To be quite
honest, I would not have considered W&L had it
been an all-male school, and I imagine—I know—
that many of my classmates felt the same way.
Having attended a single-sex high school, I knew
how parochial a place like that could be. I wanted
to learn in an environment which considered both
halves of society. I am very glad I did. Some of
the best friends I have from W&L are females.
Sure, maybe the decision wasn’t as complex as that
when I was 18, but I had plenty of time to transfer
to Hampden-Sydney. I obviously did not, and I
am proud that my diploma comes from
Washington and Lee.

I have to ask a question of Mr. Whipple and
Mr. Cimmino and every other alumnus I’ve heard
put down W&L. Did the wonderful education you
got, but seem to think I did not get, make you so
bitter, or was it something else that happened later
in your lives? If anything, my Washington and Lee
is 10 times better than anything it has been in the
past. Four years ago when I was entering
Washington and Lee, very few people in Connec-
ticut had even heard of it. Now, I have people call-
ing me asking for recommendations.

I love W&L and Goshen and party weekends
and the ‘‘shimmering beauty of the campus.’’ Go
ahead, Mr. Whipple, bite the bullet and believe

it’s all gone. Believe, if you want, that only your
generation could experience such beauty, such joy,
and such love. It’s still there, and we all experience
it. If you want to criticize W&L, at least go there
and check it out. Check out Fancy Dress or
Homecoming or Christmas weekend. If that
doesn’t bring joy to your heart, maybe you should
just forget it. The school is all it ever was and
much, much more. You may have to learn a few
sorority names to understand all the T-shirts,
gentlemen, but give it a try. Then explain to me
what you are talking about.

I wonder if there was this much bad feeling ~
when they changed the name to Washington
College?

EDITOR:

Speaking of “‘irrelevant’’ arguments, Dr. Mar-
vin L. Daves’s attempt [‘‘And Furthermore,”’ Oc-
tober 1990] to refute the contention that burning
the flag is speech never even addresses the issue
he asserts he’s rebutting. In fact, he has begged
the very question he says he’s confronting.

His entire argument seems to attack what he
calls ‘‘judicial legislation.’’ He asserts that the
Supreme Court decision that flag burning is pro-
tected speech was a gross misapplication of the
court’s constitutional powers, but he never
demonstrates that flag burning is not speech. Ac-
tually, all Dr. Daves’s proofs that the decision was
wrong can be seen to be proofs that it was right
if you make the opposite assumption from his: that
flag burning is speech. If you assume that
position—an equally valid assertion, since Dr.
Daves offers no support for his stand—then
everything Dr. Daves delineates as proper judicial
procedure was followed. Only if you assume that
flag burning is not speech does Dr. Daves’s
analysis of the Supreme Court action make it seem
inconsistent with the court’s constitutional authori-
ty. A solid argument, however, cannot be based
on an assumption. This principle holds true, I
understand, also in a court of law—even the
highest one.

Furthermore, Dr. Daves and others who can-
not see flag burning as speech because they insist
on a literal interpretation of the word ‘‘speech”’
ought to consider that under that interpretation,
no nonverbal communication would be constitu-
tionally protected. No symbol or symbolic act,
however righteous in the eyes of Dr. Daves’s
ideological companions, would be free from of-
ficial censorship. If someone took a notion to pre-
vent it, you could no longer display a cross, a star
of David or a crescent, not to mention a hammer
and sickle or a swastika. If I could muster enough
support, I could prevent you from putting your
company logo on your correspondence. None 0
those are literally speech any more than is the flag
or its burning. Neither, you might note, are the
busts of Lee and Washington—two potent sym-
bols among certain folks.

EDITOR:

I am troubled by and have trouble figuring out
how to respond to Peter Cimmino’s letter in the
July issue, even though I have read his letter several
times. Maybe it’s easiest just to take it from the
top.

The only time I have really gotten involved with
W&L’s affairs since graduation was over the issue
of coeducation. My bias was in favor. I would like
to feel that I went to a great university, and you
have no chance of being, remaining, or becoming
a great university (however you define that) if you
start by excluding 50 percent of the eligible
candidates.

Like Peter, I would probably have trouble get-
ting into W&L today. But I would have equal trou-
ble getting hired today by Bankers Trust Co., for
which I have worked for the past 30-plus years.
So what? I’m still working there, and I am ex-
hilarated by the fact that it is a leading merchant
bank and I have to prove every day or so that they
ought to keep me on.

Like Peter, I had no use for the Gentleman’s
C mentality, but I don’t know if W&L’s present

 

students are ‘‘clawing each other’s eyeballs for WASHINGTON AND LEE
grades.’’ Somebody who’s closer to the campus

today will have to answer that one for me. I suspect ARM CHAIRS AND ROCKERS
(and hope) that the University still nurtures the With Crest in Five Colors

inner-goal directed individual and helps each stu-
dent develop self-confidence, regardless of his or
her grades.

Like Peter, I cherish Goshen Pass, which I had
the great good fortune to know long before I ar-
rived at W&L as a student, as my father grew up

in Lexington and we weak beck often.1t -cemaied The chairs are made of birch and rock maple, hand-rubbed in black lacquer (also

FIVE GREAT IDEAS THAT SHAPE OUR LIVES
(JULY 7-13)

An intellectual adventure for people of any age and experience who “love wisdom.”
Our inquiry into uncommonly explored reaches of five key concepts that have shaped
civilization and individual lives through the ages: beauty, goodness, justice, equality,
and faith. Our program will also examine several contemporary issues or decisions
that reveal the life of these ideas today. This Alumni College will include classic and
modern works of literature and philosophy in addition to film and art. Faculty for the
program are Harlan Beckley, David Caudill, and Lad Sessions together with several
guest speakers.

AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND:
WAY OVER AND DOWN UNDER (JULY 14-20)

A brisk history of both Australia and New Zealand, with special focus on the fascinating
and unusual natural history of the South Pacific. Discussions of British colonialism
in the subcontinent, the cultures of the aboriginal and other native populations in the
South Pacific, and fantastic variety of wildlife and unusual geography of this region,
as well as the literature and film of Australia. This program will anticipate an Alumni
College Abroad to New Zealand and Australia in 1992. Faculty include John McDaniel,
Harry Porter, Robin Winks of Yale University, and guest faculty from Australia.

EMPIRE WITHOUT A CROWN: CENTRAL EUROPE
YESTERDAY AND TODAY (JULY 21-27)

A timely inquiry into the rapid changes now occurring in Central Europe, with sharp
focus on the social, political, and economic developments in Poland, Czechoslovakia,
and Hungary. Our perspective will include both current developments as well as the
broader historical context of the Slavic nations. We'll also examine a full range of
cultural issues, from literature and the arts to education, media, and ‘‘national identi-
ty’’ as well. Faculty for the program include Lamar Cecil, Severn Duvall, and visiting
professor from Poland Krzysztof Jasiewicz, as well as distinguished guest speakers.
