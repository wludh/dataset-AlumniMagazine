ON THE COVER: Youre nose to nose with Jewel—
a remarkable 10-foot-high pachyderm which may best
symbolize the size and scope (not to mention party
affiliation) of the most recent Mock Convention, held
on the campus May 9-10. A series of special articles
on the 1980 convention, along with extensive photo
coverage, begins on the next page. Cover photo by
Sally Mann, who made most of the pictures featured in
the lead articles.

again this year “privy to what most
[G.O.P.| leaders considered ‘classified’
information. Some of the guidelines the
real Republican officials revealed will not
be known publicly until the Republican
convention in Detroit this July.”)

That the real politicians regard W&L’s
Mock Convention as unusually significant
was proved almost the minute the
balloting was over in Warner Center. An
urgent telephone call came through to the
podium; it was the chief of George Bush’s
campaign in the mid-Atlantic region. What
had happened, he wanted to know—which
delegations did what, and why, and on
whose authority? He was impressed with
the answers—not happy, but impressed.

To no one’s surprise, Reagan moved
out front with the very first delegate votes
cast—Alabama’s, where he captured 18 of
27. Former China envoy and CIA director
George Bush, the only other hopeful
whose name was even placed in
nomination by the mock Republicans,
never had a chance.

In fact, Alabama—perhaps
interestingly—was the least solidly pro-
Reagan state in the old Confederacy, the
consequence of a binding primary. Even
the border states, except Arkansas—also
perhaps interestingly—went
overwhelmingly to Reagan.

Bush managed to take majorities in
only 10 of the 53 delegations, and all of
them except Michigan were tiny states
numerically and most were predictable—
Connecticut, the District, Hawaii, Iowa,
Maine, Massachusetts, Puerto Rico and
the Virgin Islands in addition to Arkansas
and Michigan. Bush's biggest single bloc
came from Michigan, but even that state’s
majority of 43 in his favor represented a
scant 4 percent of the 998 needed to win
the nomination.

Reagan’s nomination came only 21
minutes into the session—the speediest
resolution of a Mock Convention in
memory.

The student delegates, flawlessly
faithful to their mission of trying to be
accurate in every particular, launched a
flag-waving celebration when Reagan went
over the top.

But as they acted out that réle, the

2

 

Nice try for Bush, but in vain

W&L men and their dates, despite the
student body's reputation for hard-core
political conservatism, seemed not to have
their own hearts wholly in it. The victory
demonstration lasted less than two
minutes, and in fact, the cheering when
W&L's lacrosse team was mentioned
(twice: by Illinois and by Virginia) was
notably more enthusiastic.

Perhaps because of the utter lack of
suspense over the outcome of the
presidential nomination, and perhaps also
because of their predecessors’ success in
prophesying who would be tapped as
running-mate four years ago (when Jimmy
Carter too had pretty much sewn up the

 

nomination by Mock Convention time),
the 1980 mock politicians paid a good bit
of attention to the vice-presidential nod.

And the word was Howard Baker.
Again, in good measure it was inside
information from real party pros that
directed the W&L convention.

(Look for a focus on the vice-
presidential nomination to become a
fixture at future Mock Conventions. At
W&L, once is a precedent, and twice is a
tradition. )

A Two-Day Triumph

great undertaking,’ one judge described
it, and a credit to state chairman Scott
Bond, a freshman who didn't take very
long to catch the Mock Convention spirit.

Real politicians abounded at the Mock
Convention, and the big names were
bigger than ever before. To bring together
the Republicans’ most venerable Senator,
the party chairman himself, W&L’s and
Virginia's own Senator, a rising young
representative from the once-solidly
Democratic deep South, and the governor
was no easy proposition.

Mayor Charles F. Phillips Jr., W&L’s
President Robert E. R. Huntley, Sen.
Warner, and Gov. John Dalton each came
to the podium in the first session to offer
greetings to the delegates. Dalton
confidently predicted that each of the
delegates would “be fully converted to the
Republican party by the time this is over.”
Judging by the response to his speech,
most already were—at least for the
duration of the weekend. And though
Warner got good-natured boos from the
crowd when he explained that his wife,
actress Elizabeth Taylor, couldn't be
present because of moviemaking
commitments, he received an ovation for
stating he was proud as a W&L man to be
“guided every step of my career by the
great Lee principles of excellence, duty
and honor.”

Arizona s Barry Goldwater, Senate
patriarch and 1964 Republican candidate
for president, brought several thousand
delegates and spectators to their feet time
and again with a keynote address filled
with assaults on the “meat-headed liberals”
and “knothead president” he regards as
ruining the government.

“The word ‘simple’ just kills the press
and the liberals,” he began, “and when a
conservative suggests that we try what has
always worked, it scares the hell out of
om.”

America’s decline in military power
and its economic woes were Goldwater's
chief targets as he slammed away at the
Democrats. “We're losing. I don’t like to
lose.” And the crowd roared when he jibed
at President Carter: “I’ve known some
pretty smart peanut farmers in my life. But
this isn’t one of them.”

a

  

... and 24 hours later, only the debris remains.

Henson Moore, the representative
from Louisiana, followed Goldwater,
describing the party platform as “a
statement of principles and goals—almost a
roadmap. A great electoral victor in a
state famous for its affection for
Democratic politicians—and the more

 

 

eccentric, the better— Moore noted
laughingly, “if you're a Republican in
Louisiana, you ll be happy to speak to any
group of two or more people—and if at
least one doesn’t walk away, you’ve scored
a great success.” As he hammered against
governmental controls on individual

A Thrill a Minute

An Incendiary Float, a Latesleeping Elephant, and the Lost Voice of Reagan

There wasn't much of a horse race for
the nomination at W&L’s 17th Mock
Convention, but—scrupulously
maintaining another venerable convention
tradition—there was no lack of
unscheduled drama and buffoonery.

At the parade reviewing stand,
pyrotechnics magnate Francois Blot stands
poised on the roof of the Robert E. Lee
Hotel with a fireworks display—watching
stray fragments set the Wisconsin float on
fire. The incendiary float, which began as a
salute to the dairy industry, is one of the
last floats in the parade, and the city fire
department's truck (in line anyway to close
the procession), is ready to douse the
rather spectacular flames. But not to
worry. Cool-headed spectators and
delegates calmly douse the fire with
glasses of milk, or other libations, even
before the Lexington firefighters can move
into action.

There was parade chaos even before
the parade started. Fifteen minutes after it
was supposed to have stepped off, when
nothing had happened, convention officials
learned that (1) the elephant had
overslept, and there was some question
about how to remedy such a situation and
who would do it; (2) the ceremonial ribbon
Sen. Warner was supposed to cut was too
short to reach across Main Street; (3) it
almost didn’t matter, because the Senator
himself was late and almost stranded,
having stopped in the fire lane at a super-
market outside Roanoke for a carton of
milk, leaving his student driver momen-
tarily alone—to be accosted, inevitably, by
the police. (The driver’s response:
“Listen, I'm driving a Senator to W&L!”
The constabulary was about to put the
student in the tank to sober up when
Warner returned and settled the situation
impressively.)

Clark Mollenhoff, the Pulitzered
investigative reporter turned W&L prof, is
overheard in the press gallery, muttering
“Only one thing's wrong. This is so darned
much better organized than any real
convention.”

When Jean Baxter—third-year law
student, western states co-ordinator, the
first woman ever to sit ona Mock
Convention Steering Committee— is

8

brought to the podium, the male delegates
greet her with a barrage of jovial boos,
then rise in a happy ovation that lasted a
full three minutes, longer than any other
at the convention. . .

Everyone has his favorite thrill at the
convention. It was difficult to find out what
the big one was for treasurer Chip Arnold,
until that consummate accountant let it be
known: “I’m so glad. I got to use my new
electronic calculator.”

Greatest collective heart-stop of the
weekend: actually losing Ronald Reagan
on the telephone when he called to make
his acceptance speech. About ten minutes
of unbelievable tension, until the gracious
Governor called a second time and asked
“Don't you guys want me to say a few
words?”

 

 

Dewar's Pays Off

LEXINGTON, Va.— Washington
and Lee University newspersons
exulted on learning that the good grey
New York Times had devoted a full
column in its front news section to the
University's Mock Republican Con-
vention. The story, by Francis Clines,
focused on Sen. Barry Goldwater’s
appearance at the Mock Convention
and also quoted liberally from Clines’s
interview with student pol Kevin
Dwyer.

“Hot damn!” exclaimed the PR
chief when he heard about the Times
article. “I told our gray-bearded,
avuncular boss it was worth it to bring
out the Dewar’s instead of feeding
them that cheap Passport scotch!”

—E. Stewart Epley
W&L Business Correspondent

 

 

 

Judge Charles E. Long Jr., a member
of the board of the Sumners Foundation,
overheard on the VIP balcony: “Every
dollar we gave these men has been seen in
the work they ve put out. This really is
practical politics and I love it practical.”
(The judge later declared his intention to
go back to the foundation and recommend
that another $20,000 be appropriated right
away, to insure the stability and success of
the 1984 W&L convention. )

State parade-float slogans— Hawaii's
“Aloha, yall”; Iowa’s “Cheaper Crude Or
No More Food’; North Carolina's rueful
“Number 10 in Lacrosse; Unrated in
Love’; Idaho’s “French-Fryin’ Legion
Marching Kazoo Band and Chowder
Review Society ; Wyoming's “Disco
Buffalo.”

And the states’ self-characterizations
during the roll-call votes! California:
“Home of two great faults, the San
Andreas and Jerry Brown.” Indiana,
asserting that its basketball team is the
best in the nation, drawing the weekend's
biggest spontaneous raspberry, and
Oklahoma, “home of the finest football
team money can buy,’ and Ohio, “home of
Woody Hayes and the recession.” Virginia,
“home of nine presidents, counting
Jefferson Davis,” and Wisconsin,
“unfortunately bound by law to cast six
votes for that political chameleon, John
Anderson.’ Connecticut, voting
predominantly for Bush, declaring its
interest in electing “experience that can’t
be found in a peanut field or on a movie
set.”

President Huntley, jumping from the
car with Sen. Warner and Miss Virginia
after their early leg of the parade, then
walking back to the Robert E. Lee Hotel
to see the rest of the pageant. As they cut
across Main Street, co-chairman Simmons
despaired: “That’s gonna disrupt the entire
parade. Everyone will mob around them.”
Junior W&L publicity official, semi-
veteran of Mock Conventions of old,
responds, “No one is even going to notice
those three with those big floats on the
street.” No one did. Two points for junior
PR man. And a crashing victory for the
convention parade.

Toms Tall Talk

Wolfe's Remarks to Alumni Turn Out to Be the Right Stuff. . . and More

More than 400 out-of-town alumni and
their families—a record number—were in
Lexington on the weekend of May 8-10 for
spring reunions.

Highlights of the three-day series of
events were the annual meeting of the
Alumni Association, the John Randolph
Tucker Lecture, the Mock Convention, and
a match between W&L’s fourth-ranked
lacrosse team and the University of North
Carolina—not to mention much socializing
and reminiscing.

Tom Wolfe, 51, award-winning author
of The Right Stuff and other books, opened
the weekend with a talk Thursday night to
his fellow alumni in Lee Chapel. Excerpts
from his speech are published below.

I am deeply appreciative to all of you
who are from pentennial and decennial
classes for inviting me to come talk to you
tonight. I am a member of the class of
1951, which makes me an off-year
alumnus.

One member of our class has been very
much in the news recently, that is Herb
Hunt, the son of the fabled oil billionaire,
Herb Hunt Sr. Herb and his brother,
Bunker Hunt, have recently been haled
before a thoroughly baffled Senate
committee to face charges, if that is the
correct word, of having cornered the silver
market. Actually, Bunker Hunt is a little
more flamboyant, more talkative than
Herb, and he has managed in the last
week of this episode to add a few choice
mots to the lexicon of the Bartlett’s
Quotations of Famous Remarks in the
History of American Capitalism—one of
which was, “A billion dollars ain’t what it
used to be.” And the other when one of
the Senators peered down at him and
demanded to know what Bunker Hunt’s
net worth was and Bunker Hunt said, “I
don’t know,” and the Senator said, “Come
now, Mr. Hunt, you must know what your
net worth is.” Bunker replied, “Senator, it
has been my experience that people who
know what their net worth is aren’t worth
as much as they think they are.” And that
remark caught my attention because I have
never figured out my net worth. So I sat
down a few nights ago and figured out my
net worth, and you know, he was right.

16

 

But, you know, never while Herb
Hunt was at Washington and Lee did he
try to display the fact that he was one of
the wealthiest young men on the face of
the American earth. In fact, he went to
great length to avoid this, but every now
and then there would be a little sign to tell
you that something unusual was going on
here. Mr. Herbert Hunt Sr. decided that
it was none too soon for Herbert Jr. as a
freshman to start at the bottom of the oil
industry and learn what it was all about. So
in pursuit of that end he bought the
Texaco station at the corner of Main and
Jefferson for him, right back behind Lee
Chapel here.

Herbert Hunt was on the football
team, and remember at this time, fall of
47, Washington and Lee was in the throes
of a disease called big time football. It was
a memorable time though, and I don’t
think any of us will ever forget it. In those

days it was necessary to play a team like
Army once a year. Army was the number-
one-ranked football team in the country
and the purpose of playing Army was that
they could go to any stadium in the nation
and draw 70,000 souls, the gate receipts
from which would pay for the entire
athletic program of any team that was
willing to play them. So W&L would get
on the train on Friday evenings and head
north to New York. Well, they got on the
train this particular year, 60 W&L football
players, and the conductor comes along,
and they discovered to their horror that
the trainer who had the tickets was
somehow stranded on a platform in
Staunton, where the train didn’t stop.
Everybody figured that there would be no
problem, just explain that it was the
Washington and Lee football team on their
way to a game in Yankee Stadium with
Army. But they ran into a conductor who
listened to every argument and even
confronted eight of the biggest tigers on
the train. And with that remarkable,
fireproof bureaucratic stare that only an
old time railroad conductor can give you,
he said: “Listen, if I don’t get sixty tickets
the whole bunch of you is getting off in
Winchester.” There was great despair
because here was a man that would not be
moved. Suddenly Herbert Hunt came up
and said, “Excuse me, sir, is it still
possible to buy tickets on the train once
you get on?”

The conductor said, “Sure, son, if you
happen to have 60 times $32.” And so
Herbert Hunt mildly reached into his
wallet and peeled off $1,920 and gave it to
the conductor. As the conductor stared,
Herbert began ripping through the
remains of his bankroll to see how much
he had left. And he turned around and
shook his head and said, “Fellows, three of
you are somehow going to have to pay
your way back from this trip.”

I think Washington and Lee has been
marvelous, mainly due to the people that
have been here, in its unerring ability to
keep traditions that were worth keeping
and to get rid of that, even if it was
unpopular, which should not be kept. One
of the great things that Washington and
Lee has preserved through thick and thin

leveland P. Hickman Jr. at work in the Galapagos Islands

produced a series of definitive college
textbooks in general zoology, Biology of
Animals, in its second edition in 1978, and
Integrated Principles of Zoology, with a
sixth edition last year, to name only two.
It may be noted that W&L Hickman’s
wife, Rae, resisted the impulse to run

 

right out and acquire a degree in zoology
when they married in 1950, setting up a
“four Cohans” of sorts in the scientific
world. Instead, she handles the string
section of their flute-violin duets.

He is the force behind the biology
department's Spring Term study program

 

in the Galapagos Islands. Since 1975, three
groups have gone from W&L to see
Darwin’s fabled paradise of unique plant
and animal life.

On top of it all, he enjoys woodworking
and photography— “when I can get the
time...”

Now a 13-year veteran of W&L’s
academic community, Hickman has
emerged as a thoughtful and energetic
critic of campus affairs. One object of his
appreciation is the fact that one can truly
use the word “community” in regard to the
campus. “At Alberta, there were greater
divisions between teachers in various
biological branches— genetics, physiology,
botany—than we have here between such
different disciplines as art and
mathematics.”

The Honor System also comes under
Hickman’s gaze: “I was fascinated by the
idea when I first came here. To be honest,
I never thought anything of the type could
work, but it does—in spite of an occasional
challenge or bit of erosion. This cannot be
watched too carefully, because if the
system is lost, we'll never get it back. And
only someone who has had to endure
being without such trust can tell you how
much better it is to live under its
benefits.”

 

measurements in any direct way,’ he
notes, “because they're too small to be
seen—even with an electron microscope.”

So the professor and his aides do it
indirectly, using a substance called
dextran, developed in Sweden several
years ago. Dextran molecules of varying
sizes are injected into the bloodstream of
the fish. Then, by collecting a sample of
urine from the fish, investigators are able
to see how small the dextran molecules
must be to pass through the pores in the
kidneys.

Hickman’s interest in fish kidneys
began when he noticed the limited scope
of research regarding the porosity of the
organ. Only humans and some higher
mammals had been checked. He turned to
marine subjects, “not really knowing what
to expect. I suppose that’s the big
difference between basic and applied

research. In the former, our interest is
entirely in an unknown, with no real end
in sight.

“At any rate, it was a happy surprise to
discover that the glomerular pore size in
the fish examined was almost identical to
that of the human kidney, making it an
ideal model for our research.”

Reluctant as he is to predict future uses
for his research (“Nothing makes a
scientist engaged in basic experimentation
more upset than being asked what his
work will be used for’), Hickman mentions
one possible consequence. “In certain
kinds of kidney failure,” he says,
“particularly with severely burned
patients, the porosity of the kidney grows
out of all proportion—even allowing
valuable proteins to escape the body. By
using the model fish systems, one day we
may be able to provide a background of

information to speed the recovery of such
patients.”

Hickman’s fish tastes have shifted over
the years. For some time, he was a fan of
the southern flounder. But beginning this
spring, he’s conducting research on a new
subject—as he describes it, “a really
remarkable amphibian, the amphiuma,
actually a large aquatic salamander.”

Assisting the professor in his labors is
an undergraduate senior, David W. West
of Washington, D.C. An honors student in
the W&L commerce school, he was a
member of the four-man team that took
first-runner-up honors in the Emory
University business games this winter.
Even so, West is an accomplished science
student, and recently decided to change
his plans for a business career in favor of
medical school in the fall.

Inside St. Margaret's Lothbury Church

Spices and the Whiteheads— received a
truly royal treatment from the Abbey
clergy. Their tour of the magnificent
structure lasted more than two hours, and
took them to several rooms rarely seen by
the public, including the famous Jerusalem
Chamber. (According to tradition, this was
the room where young Price Hal of
Shakespearean fame took the crown off the
head of his dying father, Henry IV, to
signal his succession as Henry V, the “hero
king.”)

Other official concert appearances
during the week came at Our Ladye, Star
of the Sea Catholic Church in Greenwich;
St. Nicholas’ Anglican Church in Fyfield,
Essex; St. Margaret's Lothbury Church in
London; and St. Helen’s Roman Catholic
Cathedral in Brentwood. To express the
official thanks of the University, church

 

 

officials at each concert site were
presented with a reproduction piece of
porcelain from W&L’'s Reeves Collection.
“The St. Margaret's concert was unique
in terms of our audience, Spice also
noted. Located directly across from the
Bank of England in the heart of London’s
Wall Street, the midday clientele at the
church “is composed almost completely of
business executives and financial bigwigs
on their lunch hour. But they were an
extraordinarily receptive group. Many of
them stayed for our entire hour of songs,
and congratulated us after the concert.”
The tour wasn't all work. The students
had two days free in London—“and they
did an enormous variety of things, ”
according to Spice. Said Whitehead, “My
wife and I spent a good deal of time in the

A tour of the historic Jerusalem Cha

 

Photographs by Ann Spice

 

     

mber

London museums and galleries, and it
seemed that we ran into hordes of Glee
Club members at such places all over
London, whenever they had a free
minute.”

Activities on these free days included
tours of St. Paul’s, the British Museum,
Madame Tussaud’s, the National Portrait
Gallery, the Houses of Parliament, the
Tower of London, the neighborhoods of
Soho and Piccadilly—and much more. A
group of students even ran into Dustin
Hoffman on the street, in London to
promote his film Kramer vs. Kramer less
than a week after winning the Best Actor
Oscar for his performance. And one Glee
Club member, with relatives in the north
of England, was even able to ride up to
their town for a visit—to which nearly the

The entryway at St. Martin’s Church—from
which bodies were temporarily suspended in
the days of shaky medieval medicine to insure
that the patient had truly died!

whole populace came in order to give an
official greeting.

The concerts outside London gave the
W&L party an opportunity to make a
number of interesting side-trips: to
Windsor Castle and the magnificent Ely
Cathedral; to Runnymede, where the
medieval barons forced King John to sign
the Magna Carta; to King’s College in
Cambridge; and to Canterbury Cathedral,
site of Thomas Becket’s martyrdom eight
centuries ago.

And once back in London, several of
the student singers availed themselves of
that city’s theatrical riches. Many went to
see Yul Brynner in The King and I or the
revival of My Fair Lady, and one and all
saw the stage production of Agatha
Christie’s The Mouse-Trap, currently in its

 

¥

A farewell serenade to the driver-guide at the Lon

28th continuous year.

English pubs saw a lot of Washington
and Lee action, too. In Fyfield, there was
only one pub in town—“And the pubs are
usually closed by 11 p.m.,” said Spice.
“But one of our guys kept talking and
singing with the chief of police, and he not
only let the place stay open, but presented
the student with his English ‘bobby’ hat at
the end of the night.”

All the Glee Club members lodged in
English homes along the concert route,
making for instant friendships. And some
changed perceptions. In one case, two
W&L men were to stay at the home of a
priest, whose housekeeper—an elderly
maiden lady— maintained rather
exaggerated preconceptions about
American youth (i.e., that they are all

 

    
 

don airport

muggers and plunderers), and spent the
first night restless and nervous. Next
morning, it was related, she hesitantly
entered the breakfast room, not knowing
what to expect. What she saw were the
two students giving thanks before they ate,
and she spent literally the rest of the day
calling her friends to tell them of the
miracle that occurred in her house.

The Glee Club esprit de corps was
indeed catching—and sunny spirits were
reflected in the London weather that
week, about the clearest to hit the island
kingdom in more than three years. All in
all, conditions were ideal for this fifth
anniversary tour by Spice and company,
who concluded, “If you weren't an
Anglophile before this trip, you have to be
one now.

who demanded that he “perform a few more
of them tricks”— McCardell dryly notes the
result of the experiment: his “cabbages came
up radishes.” He describes the campaign to
purge all things Northern from Southern
school books, leading D. H. Hill of Wash-
ington College to write a new mathematics
text requiring students to calculate the rate
at which Indiana militiamen deserted a
battlefield, and the profit earned by a Yankee
who peddled adulterated meat and wooden
nutmegs. Research undertaken to demon-
strate the biological inferiority of blacks led
Dr. Samuel Cartwright to the discovery of
such hitherto unknown diseases as “drape-
tomania’ which transformed docile slaves
into runaways, and “dysaethesia” which
turned them into rascals. Flourishes like
these make McCardell’s book a genuine joy
to read. Combined with exhaustive research
and perceptive insights, they mark him as a
scholar of real ability and promise.

In spite of its obvious merits, The Idea of a
Southern Nation falls into a trap common to
intellectual history. It is elitist history. It
demonstrates that the most intelligent, most
articulate, most outspoken of the South's
leaders nursed the dream of Southern inde-
pendence—and for a brief time during the
1860s, made that dream a reality. But it fails
to demonstrate that the mass of ordinary
Southerners shared this dream more than
superficially, or for long after the exhilaration
provoked by secession. The case for a gen-
uine Southern nationalism rests, in the end,
on the great body of ordinary Southerners.
Until McCardell can prove that these men
and women participated in the dream of a
Southern nation, his argument necessarily
remains asserted but not proved.

Nevertheless, his cogently argued and
elegantly written book is one that no serious
student of Southern history can afford to
miss.

John McCardell graduated cum laude from
Washington and Lee University in 1971. In
the acknowledgments of his book, McCardell
points to his undergraduate years as the
source of his interest in Southern history.
He singles out “the late, inimitable” Pro-
fessor Ollinger Crenshaw and “his skilled
and friendly colleagues” Allen Moger and
Robert McAhren for their examples as
teachers and scholars. One may also note

that the book has already been awarded the
Allan Nevins Prize by the Society of Ameri-
can Historians.

McCardell was born in Frederick, Md., in
1949, and attended the public schools there.
After graduation from Washington and Lee,
he served briefly with the U. S. Army and
entered Johns Hopkins University in 1972.
There he became a student of David Donald
—perhaps the most influential scholar ac-
tively writing and teaching in the field of
Southern history today. McCardell followed
Donald to Harvard, and completed his doc-
toral studies there in 1976. Since that time,
he has been assistant professor of history at
Middlebury College in Vermont.

 

“Uncle Boomer” Mollenhoff

by Hampden H. Smith III

Assistant Professor of Journalism

A Presidential Roast

CLARK R. MOLLENHOFF. The President Who
Failed: Carter Out of Control. New Jersey: Mac-
Millan, 1980.

 

 

A couple of winters ago, when the snow
was deep and sludgy in the Valley of Virginia,
journalism students at Washington and Lee
University could tell their professor was
coming when they heard a “whump-clickety,
whump-clickety” down the hall.

In an instant, a mountain of a man in a fur-

collared greatcoat would be wheeling through
the hallway and, in a sort of lumbering
charge, barrel into his office. Most likely,
the phone would be ringing. Very likely, the
caller would be an admiral or a congressman’s
aide or an assistant to a Cabinet officer or a
senior reporter from a leading newspaper.
Quite likely, the Lexington side of the con-
versation would be clearly audible—routine
profanity and all—at least throughout all of
Reid Hall's second floor.

The whump-clickety? That came from his
old black rubber galoshes, unbuckled either
from impatience or because the sheer bulk
of the man made fiddling with those silly
little clasps more trouble than it was worth.
The boots whomped in agony as the heels
thudded to the floor and the buckles went
clickety as they shuddered from the impact.

Not only galoshes shudder from the im-
pact of contact with Clark Mollenhoff,
scourge of Presidents, nemesis to all Wash-
ington perpetrators of evil, mismanagement
and fraud.

But his young charges, as can college stu-
dents pretty universally, were not to be
buffaloed by the brawn and bluster of their
giant pedagogue. Anybody with all that
idealism, anybody that determined to ferret
out every scintilla of Washington wrong-do-
ing, couldn't be but so awful.

So they named Clark Mollenhoff, dean of
investigative reporters, Pulitzer
winner, confronter of Presidents, recent
convert to academe, “Uncle Buckles.”

But now has come Mollenhoffs latest
book, his tenth—The President Who Failed:
Carter Out of Control. It is much like the
earlier book on Ford (The Man Who Par-
doned Nixon) and the one on Nixon (Game
Plan for Disaster)—a litany of perfidy, collu-
sion, shady deals, remarkable coincidences,
stupidity, deceit, chicanery, mismanage-
ment, fraud, felony. The facts roll off the
pages and over the reader in waves, from
records of congressional hearings, from
transcripts of presidential press conferences,
from documented statements by officials
ahigh and low.

With the publication of The President Who
Failed have come dozens of articles and re-
views, one of which focused more on the
man than the book. And in it was revealed
the horrible truth that, among some in

Lynchburg Citation Is Presented to the McDowells at Annual Banquet

The Lynchburg Citation—first awarded
some 20 years ago, and the highest
recognition conferred by a W&L alumni
chapter—went this year to Catharine
Feland McDowell and her late husband,
Professor Charles R. McDowell. The
citation was presented at the Lynchburg
chapter's annual banquet on April 12, at
the Oakwood Country Club. E. Starke
Sydnor, 66, '73L, chapter president, made
the presentation.

Mrs. McDowell, better known as “Mrs.
Mac’ to the students she knew while
acting as secretary to five W&L law deans,
retired in 1976. Her Tucker Hall career
spanned 30 years. Prof. McDowell was
himself an institution among generations of y ! 2
young lawyers, teaching at the University Professor Charles R. McDowell Catherine McDowell—“Mrs. Mac”
from 1927 until his death in 1968.

Accepting the award on behalf of Mrs.
McDowell, who was unable to attend the
banquet, was her son, Charles R.
McDowell Jr.—graduate of the class of
1948 and distinguished Washington
columnist for the Richmond Times-
Dispatch. McDowell also delivered the
major speech of the evening, an
interesting “off the record” report on the
national political scene and the 1980
presidential race.

Just before the citation was presented, a
letter was read from one of the few people
who were aware of the recipients |
identities in advance: Supreme Court J *

ustice Lewis F. Powell, 29, ’31L. It said oe
LYNCHBURG—At reception before making his “State of the Chapter” address is Bert Schewel, ’41,

in part that Professor McDowell was one with Mrs. Marc Schewel, Marc Schewel, ’69, Mrs. Bert Schewel.
of the most engaging faculty members I

have ever known. Catharine McDowell
also has a prominent place in the hearts of
generations of law school graduates.” And
as he accepted the citation, the son of
these two tremendously gifted people
quietly expressed his thanks: “I know how
happy mother will be to receive this—and
father would be, too. Especially. It just
says the right things.”

The evening began with a cocktail party,
leading into a delicious dinner for the
guests, with well over 100 in attendance.
The enthusiastic crowd was kept helpless
with laughter during the chapter's satiric
committee reports that have become a | ae
hallmark of the Lynchburg annual LYNCHBURG—Chapter officers are Marc Schewel,
meeting. Once again, Bert Schewel, ’41, 66, vice president; Walter B. Potter, 48, president.

announcements about chapter business
and introduced the speakers. Bill Hartog,
director of admissions at W&L, spoke about
the University’s long-range plans for
recruitment work and reported on the
status of this year’s admissions program.
Gary Dobbs, ’70, assistant professor of
biology, delivered an enthusiastic address
on W&Ls unique faculty advisor system,
after which both he and Hartog responded
to questions from the audience. Other
guests from the University were Assistant
Alumni Secretary Leroy C. (Buddy)
Atkins, 68, and Robert S. Keefe, 68,
director of the University News Office.

SHENANDOAH. With proper ceremony
and fanfare, alumni of the Winchester,
Leesburg, Front Royal and surrounding
areas joined for the inauguration of the
Shenandoah Chapter on March 21, at the
Wayside Inn in Middletown, Va. President
and Mrs. Huntley were on hand for the
occasion, as were Alumni Secretary
William C. Washburn, 40, and Mrs.
Washburn. Presiding over the meeting
was Jay Denny, 73, who handled the
introductions and expressed thanks to Bill
Fifer, "76, and the many others
instrumental in the organization of the
chapter. Following cocktails and dinner,
Washburn spoke on the role of alumni
chapters and their impact on the
University. President Huntley also added
an interpretation of the essential need for
alumni support, and the many ways in
which it helps to give Washington and Lee
its unique appeal. Another highlight of the
program was the presentation by Jim
Eastham, 74, to Huntley of an original
letter written by Edward Valentine
concerning the latter's Lee Chapel
sculpture of Robert E. Lee. Huntley read
the letter aloud to the audience and
accepted it with thanks on behalf of the
University. In the short business session
which ended the evening, Jay Denny was
requested to appoint a nominating
committee for the purpose of electing a
slate of officers for the chapter.

I go on admiring [Shenandoah], none in the

country does better with its resources.
—Robert Lowell, 1967

I can think offhand of only two or three uni-
versity-financed reviews in which the impact
of a strong editorial personality has created a
vital magazine. The examples that come to
my mind are those of David Ray and the
strong social-radical consciousness he has
brought to the editing of New Letters for the
University of Missouri at Kansas City; of the
elegant and rather patrician standards James
Boatwright has given to Shenandoah at
Washington and Lee; and of Robin Skelton,
who has brought such a distinctively inter-
national flavor to the Malahat Review at the

University of Victoria in British Columbia.
—George Hitchcock, editor of Kayak,
in The Little Magazine in America: A Modern
Documentary History (TriQuarterly, Fall 1978)

You are the best “little” magazine in the

country.
—Allen Tate, 1970

In this year’s collection are twenty-one
stories. . . . Sixteen were first published in
the pages of little magazines, quarterly re-
views, irregularly issued periodicals reaching
a small, a very small, readership. (Shenan-
doah, for example, one of the best of these
magazines from which I have taken two
stories, prints approximately one thousand

copies of each quarterly issue.)
—William Abrahams, in the introduction to
Prize Stories 1979: The O. Henry Awards

Dr. Robert Coles, child psychiatrist and
author, is, by his own description, one of
those “Yankees who went south and fell in
love with the region.” He is a loyal subscriber
to several “good southern literary quarter-
lies’: The Sewanee Review. . . The Southern

Review . . . The Georgia Review; and Shen-

andoah.”
