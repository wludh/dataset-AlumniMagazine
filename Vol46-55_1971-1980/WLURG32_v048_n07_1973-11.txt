On the cover: It’s a foggy October morning, and
Washington Hall is shrouded in mist on its ma-
jestic hill. There is a chill in the air, and the leaves
are beginning to fall. Anyone who has spent time
at Washington and Lee is familiar with this scene,
an indelible memory. So it appeared again on the
morning before the day on which the campus was
officially designated a National Historic Land-
mark. Photograph by Pat Hinely, ’73.

Campus is officially dedicated
as a National Historic Landmark

As usual, the weather was perfect. More than 500
guests gathered on the Front Campus in front of the
two homes in which Robert E. Lee had lived while presi-
dent of Washington College. The trustees were there;
so were a number of newsmen; so were dignitaries from
Virginia’s educational, political, and cultural establish-
ments.

They had come to honor, of all things, a dozen or so
buildings—most of them dating to the first half of the
1800s, a collection of red-brick and whitewashed-wood
structures “that, together, form one of the most dignified
and beautiful college campuses in the nation,” as the
National Park Service put it.

The Governor was there, Linwood Holton, himself
a product (1944) of the institution which, he said, “has
throughout its history fought to preserve, and strengthen,
and uplift the ideals for which [Generals] Washington
and Lee stood.”

Collections of Virginia. Jn the foreground
of this foreshortened view runs the Great
Wagon Road, which linked Pennsylvania
with the South.

The ceremony was preceded by a panel
discussion in Lee Chapel on “Washington
and Lee’s Architecture, Past, Present, and
Future.” The panelists were Everett
Fauber, Sr., the noted restoration architect;
I. Taylor Sanders, the University historian;
and Frederic Cox of Marcellus Wright,
Cox & Cilimberg, principal architects for
the capital portion of W&L’s development
program.

A. Connally, was there too. It is hardly a routine dis-
tinction that the Park Service and Interior Department
have bestowed on Washington and Lee, he said: the
Front Campus has been designated to receive the high-
est honor in the federal government’s power to confer
on a private site because “careful scholarship and
rigorous comparative scrutiny” have found the Colon-
nade and flanking buildings to possess “a significance
which transcends this Valley and the limits of the Com-
monwealth of Virginia... to possess historical signifi-
cance to the whole nation—to all Americans every-
where.”

And accepting the accolades on behalf of the Uni-
versity was the gracious and well-spoken rector of its
Board, Dr. John Newton Thomas. Not only is the Land-
mark designation a first-order compliment to Washington
and Lee, he said with tongue only half in cheek; it is
also a sign of the government’s “own discernment.”

(The only unexpected turn came when, literally in
the middle of Governor Holton’s address, word began
sweeping through the crowd of attending news re-
porters that rumors were rampant in Richmond and
Washington that Holton was to be designated the new
vice president; President Nixon had said, earlier in the
day, that he would announce his nominee that night,
and Holton had been invited to the White House for
the announcement—in his capacity, as it turned out, as
chairman of the Republican Governors’ Conference. But
the reporters were eager to speculate, and an Associated
Press report triggered waves of it.)

After the ceremony members of the Board of Trus-
tees were hosts to an hour-long reception (cider) on the
lawn; later in the evening they were also hosts at the
annual black-tie banquet of the Robert E. Lee Associ-
ates (fresh salmon, Liebfraumilch, a side of beef). Dr.
Thomas was the after-dinner speaker; his topic was,
aptly, “The Distinctive Contributions of Washington
and Lee.’ (His remarks appear elsewhere in this maga-
zine.)

The University’s enduring traits are, he said, “aca-
demic excellence, concern for the individual, and the
maintenance of high moral standards.”

The October issue of The Magazine Antiques
carried two articles—one of them the cover fea-
ture—and an editorial about Washington and Lee,
coinciding with ceremonies marking the designa-
tion of the Front Campus area as a National
Historic Landmark.

The cover article is “The Buildings of Wash-
ington and Lee University,” an historical sketch
concentrating principally on the ante bellum
campus and its architecture. The article is by
Parke S. Rouse, Jr., a 1937 W&L graduate who is
executive director of ‘The Jamestown Foundation
and director of Virginia’s Bicentennial Commission.

Also appearing in the October Antiques is
“The Reeves Collection of China Trade Porcelain
at Washington and Lee University,” a review of
the February premiére exhibition of pieces from
the collection held at the High Museum of Art
in Atlanta. The authors are Callie Huger Efird
and Katherine Gross Farnham, authors of the
catalogue for .the High exhibition.

Both articles are accompanied by numerous
illustrations—the Rouse article by a full-page color
photo of Lee Chapel and 10 black-and-white scenes
of the campus in the past and now; the Efird-
Farnham article by nine color plates and four
black-and-white photos. In addition, the editorial
is accompanied by another full-color photograph
of a piece from the Reeves collection.

All the color and several of the black-and-white
photos were taken by Thomas C. Bradshaw, II, of
Lexington, a commercial photographer who is,
ironically, a graduate of Virginia Military Institute.

The cover photo of Washington Hall and the
inside color photo of Lee Chapel are the same
photos that appeared on the inside front and back
covers of the booklet Washington and Lee Uni-
versity: A National Historic Landmark, mailed in
October to all alumni and to other friends of the
University.

its maturity as a cultural establishment of consid-
erable magnitude’’—characterized by ‘the majestic
Greek revival facade of the old Washington Col-
lege group” on the one hand and one of the
majestic examples from the Reeves collection on
the other.

“No other people ever demanded so much of
its higher institutions of learning as have the
American,” Garrett says. “None other was ever
so well served by them.”

Shannon is elected a trustee

after nomination by alumni

Dr. Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., a 1939
graduate of Washington and Lee and
retiring president of the University of
Virginia, has been elected to the Board
of Trustees at Washington and Lee.

Shannon was nominated for the
trusteeship by a vote of his fellow W&L
and the Board confirmed his
selection at its October meeting. ‘The an-

alumni,

nouncement was made on Homecoming
and Alumni Reunion Weekend at W&L.

Also at the October meeting, four in-
cumbent ‘Trustees were re-elected to
serve additional six-year terms on the
board. The four are Ross L. Malone of
New York, rector-elect; Lewis F. Powell,
Jr., of Richmond; John M. Stemmons of
Dallas, and Joseph T. Lykes, Jr., of New
Orleans.

Under the comprehensive board re-
organization of 1969, Trustees can serve
a maximum of two consecutive six-year
terms. (Trustees who have been off the
board for a year or more are eligible to
begin service again, however.)

Malone, the rector-elect (see related
article), is vice president and general
counsel of General Motors Corp. Powell
is an associate justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States. Stemmons is
president of Industrial Properties Corp.
in Dallas and chairman also of the
Achievement Council, the volunteer group
charged with primary responsibility for
the University’s decade-long $56-million
Development Program. Lykes is president
and chief executive officer of Lykes-
Youngstown Corp. and chairman of the
Achievement Council’s business and in-
dustry committee. (As a member of the
federal judiciary, Powell cannot partici-
pate actively in fund-raising programs.)

Shannon, whose father was professor
of English at Washington and Lee from

1914 until his death in 1938, was a

November, 1973

Rhodes Scholar, having been nominated
by W&L. He was elected to Phi Beta
Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa while
a Washington and Lee student and has
held Fulbright and Guggenheim fellow-
ships as well.

Shannon was associate professor of
English at Virginia when he was elected
president of U.Va. in 1959. He will step
down from that post next summer, re-
turning full-time to the classroom. He
is an authority on Tennyson.

Shannon has been president of the
Virginia Association of Colleges and the
Council of Southern Universities; presi-
dent and chairman of the executive com-
mittee of the National Association of
State Universities and Land-Grant Col-
leges; board member of the Southern
Regional Education Board and the Na-
tional Commission for Accrediting, and
a member of the boards of visitors of
both the U.S. Naval and the Air Force
Academies.

Dr. Edgar Shannon addressing last year’s Phi Beta Kappa convocation at WL.

 

He holds honorary doctorates from
Washington and Lee (1959), Southwes-
tern, Duke, Hampden-Sydney, Wake
Forest, Centre, Jefferson Medical and
Bridgewater.

In 1967, Shannon was presented the
Lynchburg Citation, the highest honor
any W&L alumni chapter confers on a
graduate of the University. The citation
read in part:

“As president of the University of
Virginia he has fulfilled his heritage of
distinguished scholarship with vision,
skill and integrity — by his example en-
couraging his colleagues and his students
to higher academic attainment.

“As

Lee], gentleman, and patriot, he has been

alumnus [of Washington and

loyal to noble traditions — but, naturally
enough, ‘not unmindful of the future’.”

He is married to the former Eleanor
Bosworth, and they have five daughters —
Eleanor, Elizabeth, Lois, Susan and Vir-

ginia.

 

Malone is named rector,
succeeding Dr. Thomas

 

Incoming Rector Ross Malone with outgoing Rector John Newton Thomas and President Huntley.

Ross L. Malone, vice president and

general counsel of General Motors
Corp., has been elected rector of the
Board of Trustees of Washington and
Lee. He will assume the office formally
at the Board’s winter meeting in Janu-
ary.

The traditional title “rector” is the
equivalent at Washington and Lee to
chairman of the board. The term is trac-
ed back to the founding of Augusta
Academy, from which the University
evolved, in 1749.

As rector, Malone succeeds Dr. John
Richmond. Dr.

Thomas, professor emeritus of systematic

Newton Thomas of

theology at Union Theological Seminary,
has been a W&L Trustee since 1938 and

8

rector since 1970. Dr. Thomas is 70, the
age for mandatory retirement from the
Washington and Lee board. He will re-
tire officially from the Board at its Janu-
ary meeting.

Retiring in October after completion
of his
Joseph E. Birnie of Atlanta, a ‘Trustee

second term of service was
since 1961 and chairman of the Board’s
investments committee and its successor,
the finance committee, since inception of
the committee system in 1966.

Malone is a former president of the
American Bar Association (1958-59) and
deputy attorney general of the United
States (1952-53). He was named vice
president and general counsel of GM in

1967.

A native of Roswell, N. M., he re-
ceived his law degree from Washington
and Lee in 1932, and upon graduation
began practicing law in his hometown.
He and Mrs. Malone maintain their resi-
dence in Roswell, though they spend
most of their time in New York City,
where they have an apartment, and De-
troit.

At 47, Malone was one of the young-
est men ever elected ABA president. He
is also past president of the American
an arm of the ABA
which supports research in the practice of

Bar Foundation,

law and administration of justice. He is
a fellow of the American College of Trial
Lawyers and was a member of the Presi-
dent’s Commission on Law Enforcement

WeL

and the Administration of Justice. Ma-
lone is a trustee of Southern Methodist
University, the New York University
Law Foundation, and the Southwestern
Legal Foundation.

He is a member of Omicron Delta
Kappa, honorary leadership fraternity,
and Sigma Nu, social fraternity. He holds
honorary degrees from seven colleges and
universities, including Washington and
Lee (1958), William and Mary, and the
Universities of New Mexico and British
Columbia.

Birnie, the retiring Trustee, is chair-
man of the executive committee of the
National Bank of Georgia, and has serv-
ed as its president and board chairman
as well. He is a 1927 alumnus of Wash-
ington and Lee and has been president
of both the Richmond and Atlanta chap-
ters of the W&L Alumni Association. In
1949, he was national treasurer of the
University’s Bicentennial fund-raising
program.

A native of Greenville, S. C., Birnie
began his career in banking as a clerk in
the Alexander National Bank of St.
Petersburg, Fla. Subsequently he went to
work for the Bank of Virginia in Rich-
mond, then in 1938 he joined the Bank
of Georgia (now the National Bank of
Georgia), becoming president and direc-
tor in 1940. He is past national president
of the Consumers Banking Association
and past president of the Atlanta Sym-
phony Association. He is a director of
several businesses and of many other
civic and charitable groups as well.

As chairman of the Washington and
Lee Board’s finance committee, Birnie
persuaded his fellow Trustees to adopt
the so-called “total rate of return” con-
cept of investing, under which the Uni-
versity seeks a combination of capital
growth and dividend income from its

November, 1973

endowment according to exacting stand-
ards.

In a resolution adopted by the Board
on the occasion of Birnie’s retirement, it
noted: “During a period of time when

were
higher
education, Washington and Lee was for-

the gravest financial challenges

confronting American private

tunate to have in the forefront of its
financial leadership a man with the broad
experience and imaginative foresight of
Joe Birnie. Washington and Lee’s
sound stance in the wash of today’s er-
ratic financial currents can be linked di-
rectly to [his] effective trusteeship.”
“The 12 years during which Joe Bir-

nie was a member of the Board of Trus-

 

 

 

weg Tae gE CHS,
er Caius

 

tees were years of critically important de-
cisions affecting the future of Washington
and Lee. He took part in many spirited
debates that accompanied the progress
of a changing University through a
changing world. A man of principle and
integrity, the expressions of his views
always commanded the greatest respect
and consideration. Throughout his
service Joe Birnie brought a special
measure of the gentility and charm of
the Southern gentleman to a Board al-
ready abundantly endowed with such
attributes.”

The Trustees’ resolution bestowed on
Birnie “with admiration and affection”
the title trustee emeritus.

Randy Rouse, Master of the Fox Hounds

 

Randolph D. (Randy) Rouse of Arling-
ton, Va., was the subject of a crisp fea-
ture article in the sports section of the
Sept. 20, 1973, edition of the Washington
Post. The reason: Rouse has been the or-
ganizer of the last 13 of the 16 annual
Fairfax Steeplechase Races and another
one was coming up in two days. Said the
article, the steeplechase “just wouldn’t be
the same without Randy Rouse” and
went on, “under his guidance, the steeple-
chase races have become to the horsy set
what a ticket on the 50-yard line is to a
football fan; the only place to be.” Rouse
is Master of the Fox Hounds, president

of the National Steeplechase and Hunt
Association, chairman of the Fairfax Race
Association, and, according to the article,
“just about one of the most affable, if
not the only millionaire on his block.”
Rouse, in the article, tells how he worked
his way through Washington and Lee dur-
ing the depression years on a scholarship
and a few part-time jobs. He graduated
in 1939. He is now a builder-developer-
banker-farmer and _hotel-and-restaurant
owner. The article said he has applied
his business acumen to raising, training,
and racing his 16 horses. He said he has no
idea how many trophies and awards he

has amassed over the years, but there
“are just a mess of them.” Rouse spent
six months with other race association
members planning the steeplechase. This
included handling the average attendance
of 8,000, some 60-odd_ horses, officials,
jockeys, and equipment. Rouse, an ex-
pert rider, is also a central figure in the
annual Thanksgiving Day fox hunt in
the area. He noted that there are 8 mil-
lion horse owners in the country, and
added, “There is a tremendous interest in
horses and fox hunting today. There are
foxes all over this area. The only prob-
lem is, you rarely ever catch one.”
