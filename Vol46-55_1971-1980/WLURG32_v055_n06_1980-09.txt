FRATERNITY IMPROVEMENTS

University Takes Charge of Mechanical Maintenance in All 15 Houses

Washington and Lee has assumed
responsibility for maintaining the plumbing,
heating and electrical systems of the 15
fraternity houses at the University.

The University is also tightening its
review of the financial operation of all 17 of
its social fraternities.

The two moves are the first steps arising
from a study and report completed last year
by a special on-campus committee of
University officers, teachers, and the W&L
Interfraternity Council’s student president.
The report was submitted to W&L’s
president and Board of Trustees, which has a
special committee of its own considering the
question of the University’s financial
relationship with fraternities.

The campus committee’s report notes:
‘‘Most fraternity houses are in such a state of
physical deterioration as to require major
renovation soon,’’ and it estimates the
average house’s repair bill at $100,000.

All 15 fraternities with houses hold
subsidized, low-interest mortgage loans from
the University’s general endowment. In all,
the outstanding amount of the 15 mortgages
exceeds half-a-million dollars. In addition,
10 of the 15 houses are situated on land
owned by the University.

Under the new arrangement going into
effect this year, W&L’s Buildings and
Grounds department will provide ‘‘daily
maintenance and repair of plumbing, heating
and electrical wiring.’’ Major renovation and
contract work will not be included, but the
University will help fraternities arrange for
those kinds of projects when necessary, in
recognition of the ‘‘serious difficulties’
fraternities have experienced in recent years
when they have tried to obtain those services
themselves.

President Huntley said, in a letter to each
fraternity president, that the University will
absorb ‘“‘some of the overhead costs’’ in the
new program, but “‘cannot assume all [the]
expenses.’’ Houses will be charged a
maximum of $2,800 this academic year as
the basic fee, with the possibility of a
downward adjustment later in the year for the
two or three fraternities whose houses are in
comparatively good shape.

After the first year, the University hopes
to charge fraternities ‘‘on the basis of
services actually received,’’ President

Huntley wrote, but a uniform assessment is
necessary in the beginning because of the
absence of data by which individual charges
might be predicted.

Two employees have been added to the
Buildings and Grounds staff to carry out the
program, and other B&G personnel will
contribute their expertise in various technical
areas as well.

Participation by all W&L’s fraternities in
both programs—the mechanical-system
maintenance program and the financial-
review program—is being required by the
University.

W&L’s official attention to the fraternity
question grew out of concern primarily for
the health and safety of fraternity men and
secondarily for protection of the capital
investment in fraternity structures both of
alumni corporations, which own each house,
and of the University.

In the report submitted to the University
trustees, the campus committee noted:

 

‘Fraternities at Washington and Lee cannot
survive without University financial
assistance in some form.”’

In his letter to each fraternity president,
W&L President Huntley wrote: ‘‘Washington
and Lee’s commitment to a strong and
healthy fraternity system is clear, although
individuals may differ on the most
appropriate means to carry out that
commitment.’’

Last year, more than 60 percent of
W&L’s undergraduates were members of the
fraternity system—814 men in an
undergraduate population of 1,328. The 60-
to-65-percent figure has been about average
in recent years.

An estimated 225 men, almost all
sophomores, live in fraternity houses, and
about 550 regularly take their meals in
fraternity houses.

The two steps adopted this fall—
assumption of responsibility for maintaining
heating, plumbing and electrical systems and

|

FRATERNITY IMPROVEMENTS

regular review by the University of each
fraternity’s monthly financial statements—
are described by President Huntley as
‘*interim’’ measures.

The campus committee’s full report
outlines three ‘‘long-range models’’ for the
W&L fraternity system, from continuation of
existing policies with some modifications
through direct University ownership and
operation of all houses to ‘‘a somewhat
radical departure from fraternity life as it
currently exists,’’ creation of an on-campus
complex of social lodges that would replace
the off-campus houses where members eat
and live as well as socialize.

That report, President Huntley said in his
memo, will become the subject of ‘*full and
extended discussion’’ beginning this fall
among students, alumni, trustees, faculty
members and W&L administrators.

W&L’s fraternity system as a whole has
come under fire in recent years from a broad
coalition of groups ranging from the
fraternities’ own alumni to Lexington’s

2

townspeople because of the perceived
dilapidation of many fraternity houses.

(In other respects than the physical,
fraternities at W&L, as elsewhere, have been
targets of criticism for as long as anyone can
remember. But lately, increasingly serious
charges have been leveled against W&L’s
fraternities on the grounds that they
overemphasize social activities to the severe
detriment—some say to the virtual
exclusion—of the University’s academic
purposes.

(In 1978, the W&L faculty put
fraternities on formal notice that midweek
house parties, an institution in recent years,
would no longer be tolerated. A Student
Affairs Committee report, endorsed by the
University Council and submitted to the
faculty, noted: ‘‘The fraternity system as a
whole probably does little to promote
scholarship, [although] some fraternities
promote academic performance. . . . Just as
any sweeping generalization about fraternity
house appearance and maintenance overlooks

 

 

significant differences among fraternities, so
also would any similar statement in regard to
fraternities and academics. Quite simply,
some fraternities actively promote
achievement, some are neutral in this regard,
and some may in fact discourage academic
achievement through a general house attitude
and overemphasis on social activities.”’

(In a recent column on the topic, Robert
N. Fishburn, ’55, commentary-page editor of
the Roanoke Times & World-News, called
the new W&L policy ‘‘a bold step, but one
obviously necessary,’’ and he attributed the
problem chiefly to the disappearance of the
fraternity housemother. ‘‘Her presence,”’
Fishburn wrote, ‘‘however fleeting and
ritualistic, provided the semblance of
civilization, like a doily perched atop a
tattered chair.’’ Fraternity men, he said, used
to be more diligent looking after the physical
state of the house not always “‘because of
some vague, societal obligation, but [at least
in part] because we didn’t want to feel her
sepulchral chill.’’)

A STEP BACK IN TIME

A Chronometrical Survey of Some of the University’s Timely Assets

 

The Chandlee clock, in the Lee House
8

 

 

A student in my modern poetry course
once asked why I had such an interest in old
clocks and watches. Missing the point of my
happiest analogy, he surmised that a poem
bore at best only quaint resemblance to a
clock. It struck him further as odd that a
professor of the modern would have much
interest in the antique. I explained on
reflection that, while the work of his
classmates created in me a natural
preoccupation with time, I went to these
things mainly for relief. In the exquisite
movement of an ancient watch, for example,
I found a lustrous and precise universe.
There everything made sense and moved in
perfect harmony toward a profoundly useful
function. As a humanist, of course, I would
never want to live there, but as a teacher in
the inexact science of literature I found it
salutary to visit such a place at least once a
week. So my interest in old timepieces was
more than a diversion to my profession. It
was in part a consequence.

On this occasion, my interest is an
excuse for some minor pedantry as well. We
have at Washington and Lee several
venerable old clocks and watches that are, or
ought to be, as remarkable to the general
public as they are to the horologist. Two of
them in particular, the Chandlee clock in the
Lee House and George Washington’s watch
in the Lee Chapel Museum, have doubtless
considerable historical value. We are indeed
fortunate to have them. But to the inveterate
clockwatcher, such as myself, there are in
the halls, offices, and closets of our campus
a number of pieces whose appeal may extend
beyond their common function. Centuries
ago, clockmakers promoted their art with the
slogan, ‘‘Good clocks tell more than time.’’
Today, by their very taciturnity, these old
clocks seem to fathom and contain whole
epochs. The Chandlee clock is one of them.

The plaque on the Chandlee clock reads:

This clock, made by Benjamin Chandlee about
1752 and owned by the Lee-Custis family at
Arlington, was received by Washington and
Lee University in 1972 as a gift from the
estate of Frederick A. Fitzgerald of Lexington,
Virginia.
That the Lee-Custis clock should find its way
to Lexington independently of Washington

and Lee is itself an extraordinary
circumstance. We have the good offices of

 

The Chandlee clock, (detail), ca. 1752

Rupert N. Latture to thank for discovering
the coincidence and arranging the Fitzgerald
bequest to the University.

A note by Mr. Fitzgerald on a
photograph of his beloved clock explains
how the piece came into his possession. It
began its journey from Lee’s home at
Arlington during the Civil War when, in the
hands of Federal troops, it was sold at
auction to a Mr. John Mitchel, then of New
York. Mr. Mitchel later moved to Montclair,
N.J., and, in 1895, sold his clock to a Dr.
S. C. G. Watkins, a local dentist and civic
historian who regaled his patients with the
clock’s tradition. In 1938, Mr. Fitzgerald
bought the clock from the Watkins estate and
some years later moved to Lexington, where
he owned and operated a bookstore on Main
Street. Some time after the death of her
husband, Mrs. Fitzgerald called upon Mr.
Latture, seeking counsel on the clock’s
rightful disposition. Thus in 1972, over a
hundred years after its departure from
Arlington House, Lee’s noble clock arrived
at its post in Lee’s final residence.

Apart from its association with the Lee
family, the Chandlee clock has an illustrous

 

 

Lee and his college (banjo clock, detail)

 

The familiar Lee Chapel clock

tradition of its own. It is one of the few
surviving tall case clocks made entirely in
the American colonies. From the eighteenth
century well into the nineteenth, most tall
case, or grandfather, clocks owned
movements manufactured in England. The
American ‘‘clockmaker’’ made only the
case. Benjamin Chandlee Jr., (1723-91) and
his father, however, were highly skilled
artisans who possessed both the rare
knowledge and equipment for the
manufacture of brass movements. The
process was slow but, with the demand from
the increasing number of people in the
colonies who could afford a clock, the
Chandlee clockmaking business thrived. Of
the 40 clocks made by the senior Chandlee at
the family shop in Notingham, Md., only six
are known to exist. Benjamin Jr., produced
about 60, though only 20 have been found.
The clock inherited by the Lees from the
Custis family was probably made by
Benjamin Jr., as certain refinements in its
style indicate some straying from the Quaker
austerity of the elder Chandlee. The ornate
brass spandrels on the face have been lost
and the finials appear to be replacements, but
otherwise the clock and its mahogany case
are remarkably well-preserved. Today, it

 

Inside the Chapel belfry

stands at its proud height at the end of the
entrance hall of the Lee House. Mr. Latture,
I am told, pays it an occasional visit.

Five other clocks on campus deserve at
least brief mention. Most of them have been
bequeathed to the University. They include
three tall case clocks, all with movements
made in England. The George Slater clock in
the Head Librarian’s office was made around
1850 in Josiah Wedgewood’s little town of
Burselm in Northwest Staffordshire. It has
been handsomely restored by a local
cabinetmaker, Irvin Rosen of McKinley.

A clock marked ‘‘R. Preco, Tewksbury,
Mass’’ arrived with the Reeves Collection
from Providence, R.I. Mr. Preco may have
made the case, but the works were imported
from a London clockmaker named Wilson in
the early 19th century. It awaits restoration.

An elegantly inlaid clock marked
‘*London, 1759’’ stands in the outer office of
the President. It offers a revealing cultural
contrast to the pious simplicity of its colonial
counterpart, the Chandlee clock. American
cabinetry did not aspire to such
sophistication until the Philadelphia school
of the later 18th century.

Waltham in the early 20th century is in the

George Washington’s watch

care of Bub Mohler, director of University
services. An unsuccessful prototype designed
for the Southern trade, it displays a rather
earnest painting in reverse of Lee and his
college on the pendulum glass. The clock
itself is ‘‘temperamental,’’ according to Mr.
Mohler, as well it should be.

This leaves the most visible face on
campus, the tower clock above Lee Chapel.
Early photographs suggest that the tower
always wanted a clock. Leslie Lyle Campell,
a retired physics professor who earned one of
the few Ph.D.s awarded by W&L, had one
finally installed in 1948. He donated the
clock and Westminster chimes to the memory
of his friend and classmate, Livingston
Waddell Houston, who drowned in the North
River in 1886. (There’s a memory.) The
clock is powered by a small electric motor
and is generally reliable, though in its early
years it had a capricious tendency to run
backwards. It has a full complement of
chimes designed to signal each quarter hour,
but as a courtesy to the general population
the clock is programmed to sound only on
the hour. On the day I climbed the tower
ladder to investigate the mechanism, at
precisely three o’clock I lost my hearing for
two days.

Even in its time, George Washington’s

10

 

His initials on the reverse

pocket watch, with its small hour and minute
register and long sweep second hand, was an
unusual piece. The emphasis on seconds in
its design suggests a rather vaunting
testimony to its accuracy. By the hallmarks
on its case, one can date the watch at 1786.
The English firm that made the watch,
Anderson and Robinson of Lancaster, ceased
production shortly thereafter. It is not known
whether this was the only watch Washington
owned in his later years—he may have kept
as many as he had sets of teeth. Certainly its
price must have made it very dear to him.
Even for a gentleman of his wealth and
position, a 22 carat, pair-cased gold watch
was quite expensive. Washington also may
have found it a bit clumsy as well; the bulky
fusee style watch was beginning to be replac-
ed by models that seemed somewhat less like a
large walnut in the pocket of one’s waistcoat.
It may have been carried only on formal
occasions, as the soft gold case does not
show much wear.

Lee himself came into possession of
Washington’s watch when the Polk family,
which had owned the watch in the early 19th
century, honored Lee’s distant relation to
Washington through the Custis family. Lee’s
own watches were of the thinner, more
practical variety. The Lee Chapel Museum

 

Its inside inscription

has two of them, both gold keywind models.
One made by M. T. Tobius of London, ca.
1820, was reportedly found in Lee’s tent by
advancing Union soldiers. It was donated to
the Chapel Museum by a descendant of one
of them, Mrs. A. P. Silverthorn, in 1947.
The other (with a dial favoring Confederate
gray) is a fine Swiss watch by Gounouilhon
and Francois, given to the Museum by Lee’s
grandson, George Bolling Lee.

Perhaps the most gorgeous watch in the
Museum collection is that once owned by
Bolivar Christian, the trustee who nominated
General Lee to the presidency of Washington
College. So astonishing is it in its glittering
grandeur that the watch is virtually
unreadable. It arrived with ceremony in
1975, bequeathed to the University by
Christian’s great nephew, Harry Lee
Christian.

There are doubtless other clocks and
watches at the University with stories
perhaps more amusing than those above: the
digital chronometers of the coaching staff,
for example, synchronized for a chorus of
‘‘beeps’’ on the hour, or the teacup-rattling
class-change bell clock on the third floor of
Washington Hall. But this treatise must end.
And I haven’t yet explained how a clock is
like a poem.

Ce $1.1-Million Tucker Renovation Begins; New Trustee; Boothology

?

Washington and Lee has begun a year-
long, $1.1-million renovation and
remodeling of one-and-a-half floors of the
former law building on the Colonnade,
Tucker Hall, to accommodate the psychology
department and computer center.

The project is being undertaken in two
phases. In the first, the old law library
reading room—which occupied the back half
of Tucker Hall’s main floor—is being
readied to house the computer and a
mezzanine is being added in the middle of
the room to provide offices and classrooms
for the psychology department.

Simultaneously, the front part of
Tucker’s basement is being remodeled to
become a cluster of laboratory and work
areas for experiments in psychology.

Once the new computer facilities are
completed—about Christmastime this year—
the computer itself, now operating in
temporary quarters in the back part of the
Tucker basement, will be moved upstairs to
its new permanent location, and work will
begin to convert that part of the basement
into other labs, offices, and teaching and
research facilities in psychology.

That second part of the Tucker project is
expected to be completed next summer.

The new mezzanine level in the old law
library is being constructed as a kind of
island in the middle of the two-story room,
in order to preserve the architectural
character that distinguishes it.

 

 

The computer center on the main level
will provide ample work areas for students,
teachers, and the computer staff in addition
to the computer itself. W&L’s computer is
used for formal instruction in computer ; sian Be |

faculty in a large number of departments—
principally in the natural and social
sciences—and for many administrative
functions, from payroll and accounting to
keeping students’ academic records.

When the basement is completed, it will
become the teaching and_research center for
W&L’s psychologists.

In addition to another faculty office, the
basement will have several small laboratories
that will be used by teachers and
psychology students for research, and most on eB :
of the labs will be equipped for sophisticated A vintage view of Tucker’s double-story law library

experiments in a wide range of subfields of
psychology.

There will be two laboratories equipped
for research in developmental psychology,
for instance; another for electrophysiological
experimentation such as measurement of
brain waves; a lab for research into
perceptual phenomena; one for psychomotor
testing, and another for psyometric testing.

Each of those subfields is one in which
W&L offers coursework, and at least one
W&L professor is also actively engaged in
research in each.

The two psychology classrooms, which
have been specially designed, will be
equipped with videotape playback
capabilities. There will also be videotape
recording and playback equipment in all the
laboratories in which it will be useful.

The Tucker renovation will add extensive
new facilities for research in human
psychology that have been inadequately
provided in the department’s current area in
duPont Hall. There will also be several small
rooms devoted to animal experimentation in
the portion of the Tucker basement being
renovated in the first phase of the project.

W&L’s fine arts department will move
into the space in duPont freed next summer
when the psychologists complete their move
to Tucker.

The renovation of 45-year-old Tucker—
an element in W&L’s decade-long $62-
million development plan—is part of a
general program to provide badly needed
additional classroom, office and research
space for many of the undergraduate
departments in the social sciences and
humanities.

Tucker was partly renovated, after the
law school moved to Lewis Hall, in order to
accommodate most of W&L’s foreign
language classroom-and-office needs.

And Newcomb Hall will be remodeled
after the commerce school moves to
McCormick and will become the home of the
history department and perhaps one or two
other, smaller departments.

Washington and Lee an ideal location for
1980. Most of the workshop’s meetings and
lectures took place in the new undergraduate
library.

Summer 1981 will find the campus even
busier, with the inauguration of two
business-related conferences. Planning has
already begun for a conference for rising
high-school seniors to acquaint them with
economic and business-related fields. The
architects of the program expect to enlist
between 50 and 60 students, primarily from
Virginia, to participate in the program.
Professors in W&L’s School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics will conduct the
conference.

A summer institute in the. humanities for
business executives is also being planned. It
is envisioned as a two-week program of
intensive interdisciplinary study of a topic of
critical interest to upper and middle-level
executives, and will be conducted primarily
by the W&L faculty in the humanities, with
support from the business-administration
faculty.

 

After two centuries,
Booths come in pairs now

Even at Washington and Lee, where
family ties that reach into hoary mists of
history and distance are the rule rather than
the exception, there can’t be many
genealogical networks as vast as that of Cary
Gamble Booth and George Lea Booth, who
received their degrees this past June. (They
were the only identical twin sons of an
alumnus in the class. In fact, they were the
only twins in the class. But that is another
story.)

The Booth brothers’ background could
hardly be more solidly W&L. Their family
ties to the school run like lacework through
both sides of the families of their parents: A.
Lea Booth of Lynchburg, a 1940 W&L
graduate, and Mary Morris Gamble Booth, a
Sweet Briar graduate.

It all goes back seven generations to their
great-great-great-great-grandfather, Robert
Gamble, who went to Augusta Academy
even before it was chartered in 1782. He was
a colonel in the Revolution, then entered
business in Richmond, where Gamble’s Hill
is named in his honor. He was a founding

16

 

officer of the Society of the Cincinnati,
whose Virginia treasury was donated to
Washington College.

The line traces through a great-great-
grandfather, uncles, in-laws, and cousins at
varying degrees of removal through,
inexorably, their father, Lea Booth, whose
W&L connections are themselves about as
extensive as anyone’s ever were. He was the
University’s public-relations chief for a time
and taught journalism; he was and is the
founding executive director of the Virginia
Foundation for Independent Colleges, a
group created 28 years ago largely at the
instigation of then W&L president, Dr.
Francis P. Gaines, to raise money from
business and industry on behalf of 12 of
Virginia’s private four-year liberal arts
colleges. In 1976, he received an honorary
LL.D. degree from his alma mater.

Other family members with W&L
connections include a great-great-great-great-
uncle, Cary Breckenridge, an 1816 graduate;
a great-great-grandfather, George William
Peterkin, who received honorary doctorates
in both divinity and law in 1878, became the
first missionary Episcopal bishop of West

Mary Morris Gamble Booth and Lea Booth, ’40, with sons George and Cary, ’80, (or maybe Cary and George).

 

Virginia, and was aide-de-camp to General
Pendleton in the Civil War; and a great
uncle, Edmund Lee Gamble, class of 1929,
who became a distinguished professor of
chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.

One of the most prominent antecedents of
the Booth twin brothers was their great-
grandfather, David Gardiner Tyler, son of
President John Tyler. ‘‘Gardie’’ Tyler, who
eventually became a Congressman and a
judge, studied at Washington College both
before and after the Civil War, graduating in
1869. Tyler revered General Lee during his
years as a student at Washington College and
wrote in a letter that Lee was ‘‘universally
beloved and reverenced by all the students,
and his word is law with them. . . . His
influence and energy alone have made what
was formerly a simple Academy one of the
finest colleges in America.’”’

It is fitting that Tyler became one of
‘*General Lee’s boys,’’ because Lee was also
a relative of Cary and George Booth—a first
cousin, five times removed. But with Booth
and Gamble and Tyler and Lee connections,
who’s counting?

WATER-POLO PIONEERS

W&L’s Newest Team Aspires to Swim Its Way to Eastern Championship

The youngster in the W&L athletic
family is beginning to grow up—and grow
up fast.

In the fall of 1977, water polo began as
the University’s 13th intercollegiate sport.
That season, the Generals finished with an
11-9 record; in 1978 it was 15-9; last fall it
was 20-7 and included a trip to the Eastern
Intercollegiates.

‘*This sport and our reputation are indeed
growing,’’ says head coach Page Remillard,
who took the helm beginning with the 1979
season. *‘We’re developing into one of the
strongest teams in the East. The next team
goal—maybe even more like a dream—is a
spot in the NCAA Championship
Tournament. That would be quite an
accomplishment for a Division III (non-
scholarship) school.”’

Remillard, a mustachioed 1974 graduate
of the California State Polytechnic University

20

Coach Remillard and team swimmers huddle during a time out.

at Pomona (Cal Poly-Pomona for short),
inherited the W&L program from Bill
Stearns, who initiated the sport on a club-
team basis in 1972. Early success coupled
with player desire led to adoption as a varsity
sport.

‘*There was a tremendous amount of
enthusiasm among those early W&L
players,’’ recalls Remillard, who in May of
1977 journeyed from California’s Claremont-
Mudd College to conduct a water polo clinic
here at the University. ‘‘As the pioneers of
the sport at W&L, they devoted their
energies toward firmly establishing the sport.
The team’s success these first three years is
mainly due to their efforts.

Most of these ‘‘pioneers,’’ however,
have graduated. For the 1980 season, only
one player remains from the initial squad.
Yet once departed, the athletes have
remained true to both school and sport.

‘“These early players, now in graduate
schools or business along the East Coast,
have stayed in touch,’’ Remillard explains.
A case-in-point is Biff Martin, a 1979 W&L
graduate who accepted a position with the
University’s admissions office this past
summer. A three-year water polo letterman
and the team’s leading scorer in 1979 with
98 goals, Martin will assist Remillard this
fall.

‘“As great as these pioneers were, we’re
now Starting to see a new breed of water polo
player at W&L,”’ says Remillard.
‘*Prospective student-athletes today have the
same enthusiasm, but they are coming to us
with more skills and with more individual
goals.

‘“The early players, for the most part,
picked up the sport here at W&L. Athletes
today are coming from established high
school programs.

 

Like soccer in a pool

**These new athletes are also coming in
with more individual goals. The pioneers’
goal was to provide the University with a
stable, competitive varsity sport. And
they’ve done that. Incoming players, while
still wishing to remain stable and
competitive, are looking for more individual
challenges. Specifically, the challenge to
expand their present skills, much as a student
strives to expand his knowledge in a
particular subject.’

To help these newcomers, Remillard and
his assistants (he’s constantly on the prowl
for interested people) are directing their
coaching efforts toward teaching. The idea is
to present players with as much water polo
information as possible and let them mix in
their respective skills.

‘*T believe that we have a better educated
team than ninty-nine percent of our
opponents,’’ he states. ‘‘We’re not always
better skilled, but our players know more
techniques, more game situations than
opponent players.”’

If these newcomers, their new goals, and
Remillard’s teaching philosophy mesh
together properly, will W&L become the
East Coast power?

‘It’s a possibility. Let’s just say that
we're on the right road and heading in the
right direction. We can see the Emerald City

 

and hope to arrive soon.”’

Essentially, water polo is soccer in a
pool—using a cantalope-size ball featuring a
sandpaper-type surface; using it with hands,
but with no feet touching the bottom; teams
of seven players each, including a
goaltender; four seven-minute quarters; if
necessary, two three-minute overtime
periods, and then sudden death.

W&L plays in the Cy Twombly pool at
the J. W. Warner Center, which was
completed in 1972. Never mind that the pool
has a deep and a shallow end, water polo still
works quite well.

‘‘Ideally, water polo requires a 30-meter
length pool with at least a seven-foot depth,”’
Remillard explains. ‘‘But realistically, you
can play it anywhere. Most colleges can’t go
out and build a water polo tank, so they
adapt the sport to fit their facilities.

‘“We play in tanks and shallow-deep
pools during our season. We’ve encountered
no problems at all switching back and
forth.”’

The Generals belong to the 12-team
Southern League, one of four collegiate
conferences east of the Mississippi. The
others are the Mid-Atlantic, Mid-East, and
North-East. The top two teams from each
league championship gather to compete at
the Eastern Intercollegiates. Making it from

the east to the NCAA Championship
Tournament requires an invitation.

W&L’s Southern League counterparts
include: Virginia, Richmond, Hampden-
Sydney, Lynchburg, Georgia Southern,
Duke, North Carolina, V.M.I., James
Madison, George Washington, and East
Carolina.

 

WA&L is co-host again
to golf Invitational

If at first you succeed, then by all means
do it again.

In October 1979, the W&L golf
Generals joined forces with their counterparts
across town to host the V.M.I./Washington
& Lee Invitational at the Lexington Golf and
Country Club. Thirteen schools from around
the state participated in the event, the first of
its kind for the area.

Encouraged by the large turnout and
exciting finish (the University of Virginia
edged Virginia Tech on the second hole of a
sudden-death play-off), the teams were hosts
to the 36-hole event again this fall. Play was
scheduled for Sept. 20-21 on the 6,444-yard
Lexington course.

‘*It appears we’ve got a fine annual
tournament here,’’ said Buck Leslie, who
this fall began his seventh year as W&L’s
coach. ‘*So far, we’ve got every team back
from last year’s tournament, and we’re
hoping to enlist a few more schools.”’

The Generals finished eighth among all
teams in the 1979 Invitational and second
among NCAA Division III members in the
event.

**Having so many fine Division I teams
competing makes it a tough event for any
school to win,’’ said Leslie. ‘‘We like to
think that with a home course advantage and
with some fine players, W&L will challenge
for both team and individual honors in future
Invitationals.”’

Generals whom Leslie expected to strive
for honors this fall included junior and co-
captain Bill Alfano of Butler, Pa., classmates
Jim Kaplan of Wilmette, Ill., and Titus
Harris of Houston, Texas, and sophomore
Bert Ponder of Macon, Ga. These men
helped W&L compile a 13-3 dual match
record during spring 1980.

&&

I go on admiring [Shenandoah], none in the

country does better with its resources.
—Robert Lowell, 1967

I can think offhand of only two or three uni-
versity-financed reviews in which the impact
of a strong editorial personality has created a
vital magazine. The examples that come to
my mind are those of David Ray and the
strong social-radical consciousness he has
brought to the editing of New Letters for the
University of Missouri at Kansas City; of the
elegant and rather patrician standards James
Boatwright has given to Shenandoah at
Washington and Lee; and of Robin Skelton,
who has brought such a distinctively inter-
national flavor to the Malahat Review at the

University of Victoria in British Columbia.
—George Hitchcock, editor of Kayak,
in The Little Magazine in America: A Modern
Documentary History (TriQuarterly, Fall 1978)

You are the best “little” magazine in the

country.
—Allen Tate, 1970

In this year’s collection are twenty-one
stories. . . . Sixteen were first published in
the pages of little magazines, quarterly re-
views, irregularly issued periodicals reaching
a small, a very small, readership. (Shenan-
doah, for example, one of the best of these
magazines from which I have taken two
stories, prints approximately one thousand

copies of each quarterly issue.)
—William Abrahams, in the introduction to
Prize Stories 1979: The O. Henry Awards

Dr. Robert Coles, child psychiatrist and
author, is, by his own description, one of
those “Yankees who went south and fell in
love with the region.” He is a loyal subscriber
to several “good southern literary quarter-
lies’: The Sewanee Review... The Southern
Review . . . The Georgia Review; and Shen-

andoah.”
—“Where Opinion Makers Get Their Opinions,”
Esquire, June 5, 1979
