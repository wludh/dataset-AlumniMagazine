ON THE COVER: A blending of the old and the
new symbolizes Washington and Lee’s sustaining
heritage and its confident thrust into the future.
At the center is President Robert E. R. Huntley,
whose positive leadership of the University in the
1970’s is in the best tradition of the values and
strengths imparted to the University by George
Washington and Robert E. Lee in another era.
Below, workmen are putting finishing touches on
Lewis Hall, the new law building, which the School
of Law will occupy next fall. Photos (except for
those of Lee and Washington) by Pat Hinely, ‘73.

A UNIVERSITY REPORT 1974-75

 

ROBERT E. R. HUNTLEY
President of the University

 

 

This report, distilled to salient
points, presents the state of Washing-
ton and Lee today against the back-
ground of many of the important
events of the past academic year. It
offers insight into how well the Uni-
versity is performing its misston and
where it 1s tending. I found the report
interesting and commend it to your
attention.

ROBERT E. R. HUNTLEY

 

 

ADMISSIONS AND
ENROLLMENT

Well-qualified students con-
tinue to seek admission to Washing-
ton and Lee. In recent years, the
University has received about four
applications for every place in the
undergraduate freshman class. ‘This
stable admissions pattern is gratify-
ing since some educational institu-
tions, particularly private schools,
are experiencing declines in applica-
tions. However, Washington and
Lee is not complacent. It is aware
that its admissions program must
remain equal to the growing com-
petitive challenge in student re-
cruitment.

The admissions outcome for the
freshman class entering this fall was
very encouraging. Applications rose
13 per cent to 1,399, compared to
1,235 applications received in
1974—a year that brought a slight
drop in the number of candidates
(down about 12 per cent) for the
first time since 1968.

For the 1975 entering class, the
University issued 819 acceptances
and enrolled a class of 373. In
1974, the University issued 809 ac-

ceptances and enrolled a class of 366.

In both years, however, the quality
of the students as measured by
average college board scores and
class rank was down slightly—reflect-
ing a national trend.

Overall enrollment is holding
steady. By the end of the first week
of classes this year, enrollment stood

at 1,360 in the undergraduate school
and 240 in the School of Law. ‘The
overall enrollment of about 1,600

is almost precisely the size student
body that the Board of ‘Trustees and
the administration have designated
as proper for existing facilities and
those planned for undergraduate use.
(Completion this summer of Lewis
Hall, the new law building, will
permit the School of Law to increase
its enrollment over a period of

three years to 350.)

‘The University looks for an un-
dergraduate class of between 350
and 360. This size freshman class
produces an undergraduate student
body of about 1,350 to 1,375.
Attrition—the dropping out of stu-
dents in the upperclass years for
whatever reason—has not been a
problem at Washington and Lee in
recent years. This year, for instance,
only about 50 upperclassmen who
were eligible to return failed to
return—a very low figure. And
these non-returnees were more than
compensated for by about 60 stu-
dents who transferred from other
institutions into the three upper-
classes at Washington and Lee. In
addition, there are 12 women stu-
dents who are attending the Univer-
sity for all or part of the 1975-76
academic year under an exchange
program which includes four nearby
women’s colleges—Hollins, Sweet
Briar, Randolph-Macon Women’s,
and Mary Baldwin.

Recognizing the importance of
family continuity, Washington and
Lee continues to accept a high pro-

 

 

 

 

Honor System as an anachronism or
as too difficult to administer,
Washington and Lee students,
through the Student Executive Com-
mittee, are rededicating them-
selves to the principles of personal
honor and to a sense of community
in which respect for others can
thrive. Ben Bailey, President of

the Student Body, enunciated this
determination in his Commence-
ment address in May: “I will always
disagree with persons who feel that
the Honor System is too harsh or
that it is outdated. I don’t think an
institution is imposing any great
burden on a student by asking him
or her to do his own work, to tell
the truth, and to respect the property
of others.”

The past year brought the for-
mulation and adoption by the Uni-
versity Council of a statement en-
titled ‘Policy and Standards for
Student Conduct and Discipline.”
The statement resulted from a year
of deliberation by an ad hoc com-
mittee of the faculty, the faculty it-
self, and other campus groups.
The document sets forth policies,
standards, and procedures for hand-
ling cases of student misconduct
on and off the campus and for re-
solving cases in which a student may
face state criminal charges. Under
the system, the Student Control
Committee—an all student group—
and the Student Affairs Committee
have primary responsibility for
implementing the standards and
procedures, with the faculty having
final authority. The disciplinary
system avoids trespassing on the
Honor System, but it recognizes
that some cases may involve both.

 

An overlapping case is referred to
the Executive Committee of the Stu-
dent Body, which administers the
Honor System, and no disciplinary
action is taken unless the Execu-
tive Committee returns the case to
the disciplinary bodies for action.
The University community is made
aware of the policies and standards
of conduct through publication

of the statement in the University
Catalogue and the Student Hand-
book.

The Student Activities Board,
an arm of the Student Executive
Committee, is serving the entire
University community well by spon-
soring social and cultural events that
add zest to campus life: dances,
including Fancy Dress, movies, con-
certs, and outings.

Fraternities continue to be a focal
point of student life, with over 65
per cent of last year’s freshman
class listed as pledges and about
58 per cent of the student body
affiliated with one of the 15 chapters.
Nearly 94 per cent of freshmen
participated in fraternity rush this
fall. Fraternities, however, were a
matter of concern during the past
year. Attention focused on the
physical condition of some houses
and on a denationalization move
to permit the University and the
Interfraternity Council to recognize
local fraternities without national
affiliation.

In response to concern expressed
over the deteriorating condition of

several houses, the Fraternity Loan
Committee inspected several houses
and found areas in two of them

that needed repair during the sum-
mer. Further attention to this
situation is needed and planned for
the current year by the Interfra-
ternity Council, Student Affairs Com-
mittee, and other campus groups.

The Student Affairs Committee,
acting on the recommendation of
the IFC, approved a motion stating
that national affiliation is not re-
quired for recognition of a fraternity
on this campus. Disaffiliation of
existing national chapters may be
accomplished only through ap-
proval of the undergraduate chap-
ter, the alumni corporation (or
other legal entity holding title to
the property), the IFC, and the
Student Affairs Committee. Under
this procedure disaffiliation was
approved for Pi Kappa Alpha, but
no final action has been taken by
that chapter.

During the past year, the num-
ber of chapters on campus remained
the same as Psi Upsilon became
inactive and Kappa Alpha, which
was founded at Washington and
Lee, returned as an official colony
after an absence of four years.

Inadequate career counseling and
placement services for students has
been a matter of concern for sev-
eral years. To help meet the need,
Mr. Michael Cappeto has been
appointed to serve in the new posi-
tion of Director of Career Develop-
ment and Placement in addition to
his other responsibilities as Director
of the University Center. In this
latter capacity, he succeeds Kenneth
P. Lane, Jr., who resigned in August.


 

ACADEMIC PROGRAM

‘The extensive revision of the
undergraduate curriculum in 1969
allowing students more flexibility
and individual responsibility in
their choice of courses has met with
general satisfaction. ‘he change in
the academic calendar providing two
12-week terms and a six-week spring
term is also working well, particu-
larly enhancing independent work
during the short term.

Washington and Lee is nota-
ble among institutions its size for
the number of courses it offers, and
the number of courses continues to
increase. Since 1971-72, the total
number of courses has climbed
from 682 to 732—an addition of
50 courses, many of them of in-
creasing sophistication. Yet the
number of class sections has remained
the same for the past three years,
enabling the University to main-
tain its close faculty-student rela-
tionships. More than 80 per cent of
the classes taught consist of fewer
than 25 students; more than 90 per
cent have fewer than 30 students.
At the same time, Washington and
Lee has not escaped the nation-wide
trend toward higher grades. The
number of undergraduates receiv-
ing honors upon graduation has al-
most doubled in three years. How-
ever, the grade-point average at
Washington and Lee has not risen in
the past few years as much as at
most other institutions throughout
the nation.

THE COLLEGE

A highlight of the past year—
and continuing this year—was the
offering, for the first time, of a
special program: “Society and the
Professions—Studies in Applied
Ethics.” The program is supported
by the Lilly Endowment, Inc., of
Indianapolis. It includes courses
“designed to integrate the liberal
arts curriculum with specific pre-
professional training in medicine,
law, and journalism.” (A similar
program in corporate social respon-
sibility has been instituted in the
School of Commerce, Economics, and
Politics.) In connection with the
ethics courses in medicine, law, and
journalism, a three-day conference
was held in each of the areas, in-
volving students, practicing pro-
fessionals, and specialists in applied
ethics. Five lectures given at these
conferences have been published
in a booklet compiled from the
program.

With the support of the Mary
Reynolds Babcock Foundation, the
University expanded its offerings
in courses related to East Asia. Ad-
ditional work in Chinese language
and East Asian history were offered
during the past year. Japanese
language, on a largely self-instruc-
tional basis, was offered for the first
time in 1974-75. The addition of a
teacher in the field of Asian his-
tory and the visits of lecturers in
Asian art and culture have in-
creased interest in these areas on the
campus.

In addition to the grants from
the Lilly Endowment and the Mary

Reynolds Babcock Foundation, it
should be noted that a generous
grant from the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation, made in 1972, continues
to strengthen the University’s
ability to support its faculty. I’wo
recent grants from the National
Science Foundation are also worthy
of note: one to the Chemistry De-
partment to support undergraduate
research during the summer of 1975,
and the other a three-year grant to
Dr. Leonard Jarrard, Professor of
Psychology, in support of his con-
tinuing research on the hippocampus,
a structure of the brain.

The professional archaeological
excavations at the ruins of Liberty
Hall are providing both instruction
and a better understanding of the
origins of Washington and Lee.
Studies of the site began in the
spring of 1974 and are continuing
this year. Several students are work-
ing on the project as Robert E.
Lee Research scholars under the
direction of Dr. John McDaniel, As-
sistant Professor of Anthropology.
Others are working there in con-
nection with anthropology courses
offered by Washington and Lee and
the Virginia Military Institute, with
support of funds designated for
that purpose. The studies are yield-
ing many artifacts that shed light
on eighteenth- and early-nine-
teenth-century life in this area.

SCHOOL OF COMMERCE,
ECONOMICS, AND POLITICS

Beginning last year and con-
tinuing into this academic year,
increasing numbers of sophomores
and juniors have been declaring a
business administration major. Cur-
rently, there are 71 business ad-
ministration majors in the junior
class, and 65 business majors in the
sophomore class. In addition, more
and more non-business majors are
electing the elementary courses in
administration, accounting, econom-
ics, and politics. This year, nearly
48 per cent of the undergraduate
student body are taking one or more
courses in the school. ‘These
increases seem to have developed
as a direct result of the recession
conditions in the economy and the
desire of students to major in
fields directly related to a later
career.

These increases have put a
substantial burden on the faculty,
particularly in administration and
accounting. In some cases, the size
of sections in the elementary courses
have had to be increased beyond
the ideal.

A continuing problem, aggravated
by the increasing enrollment, is
the inadequacy of Newcomb Hall
to house the School of Commerce,
Economics, and Politics. Every
square inch of the building is
being used; classrooms are crowded
and in constant use during the day.

If the current increases in enroll-
ment continue, the planned move
of the Commerce School to Mc-
Cormick Library will be more im-
perative than ever. Both students and
faculty were disappointed when it
became necessary, because of a lack
of funding, to postpone construc-
tion of a new undergraduate library,
and they hope further delay will be
short-lived.

During the year, the School con-
tinued to bring in outside lecturers
to appear before classes or to give
public lectures. Mr. Howard Bird,
Vice President of Mobil Oil Corpora-
tion, spent a week on campus as
a Woodrow Wilson Scholar, meeting
with classes and giving public talks.
Last year brought the development
of an interdisciplinary program
dealing with the social respon-
sibility of the corporation. Financed
by the Lilly Endowment, the three-
year program is directed by Dr.
Charles F. Phillips, Jr., Professor
of Economics. For the third year in
a row, the University, and the
Chesapeake and Potomac Tele-
phone Companies cosponsored a
symposium on “Competition and
Regulation” during the month of
August.

THE SCHOOL OF LAW
Eighty-one first year students
registered in the School of Law this

fall. ‘These students were selected
from 1,044 applicants for admission,
about 13 for each place in the class.
Applications came from students in
275 undergraduate institutions in
46 states. Eleven women were in the
entering class. (The School of Law
became coeducational in 1972.)

The total number of applica-
tions was down about 9 per cent
from 1974’s entering class. ‘This is
true for all good law schools be-
cause, according to law school
admissions directors throughout the
country, potential applicants of
below-average achievement are rul-
ing themselves out and not even
applying.

The Washington and Lee School
of Law will thus face a challenge in
maintaining the average quality
of its student body as it phases its
operations into the new law build-
ing, Lewis Hall, and starts admitting
a class of 115 students a year in-
stead of 80. The increasingly tight
job market for law graduates is
dampening the enthusiasm of young
people for a career in law.

As in the undergraduate school,
there is a need for far greater
amounts of financial aid in the law
school. The tuition differential be-
tween state-supported law schools
and privately-supported law schools
is increasing steadily. On the
average, tuition in the Washington
and Lee School of Law is over twice
as high as that in state-supported

 

schools. ‘To have a reasonable
chance of attracting good students,
the School of Law must be able to
bridge this tuition gap. ‘The need
for more financial aid funds is
also required by the larger student
body that will come with the oc-
cupancy of Lewis Hall.

A heartening development in
the area of financial aid last year
was the $150,000 challenge grant
from the Claude Worthington
Benedum Foundation of Pittsburgh
to provide aid for students in the
School of Law from West Virginia.
When matched by alumni and
friends of the University, the grant
will be used to establish an en-
dowed fund, with the income sup-
porting honor scholarships in law.

In a difficult year for placement
of law students, Washington and
Lee law graduates did quite well.
Eighty per cent of the Class of
1975 were employed by September
of this year, taking positions in 34
cities in 13 states. Law firms and
judicial clerkships accounted for
most of this employment. Over 15
per cent of the class went into
judicial clerkships, affirming the
judiciary’s respect for Washington
and Lee law graduates. Overall,
Washington and Lee’s placement
rate compares favorably with only
about 50 per cent placement report-
ed by some other respectable law
schools.

The School of Law’s curriculum

continues to grow in response to
changing needs in legal education.
During the past seven years, the
number of courses offered has in-
creased from 43 to 69. The faculty
remains strong; each year brings an
increase in their participation in
professional organizations and
their production of scholarly pub-
lications. The law library now con-
tains more than 100,000 volumes—
double the number five years ago.

One measure of the greater
depth in the quality and capacity
of the law student body is the in-
creased frequency of the Law Review.
It was published only twice a year
until 1973, when it went to three
times a year. This year it will be
issued quarterly.

The School of Law’s public service
activities continue to provide practi-
cal educational experience to the
participating law students and
valuable assistance to those taking
advantage of these services. Chief
among such services are the Legal
Aid Association, which provides
legal service to indigents in Rock-
bridge County; Legal Research
Association, which provides a
research service for lawyers who
submit to student members of the
association actual questions and
problems they are dealing with in
their law offices; and the Alderson
Legal Assistance Program, which
provides legal assistance by students
to the inmates of the Federal Refor-
matory for Women, Alderson,

W. Va.

ATHLETICS

The University’s policy of non-
subsidized athletics—a policy that
gives every student an equal oppor-
tunity to participate—continues to
serve its purpose of making athletics
an integral part of the overall
educational program. Last year, 368
students took part in 12 intercol-
legiate sports—28 per cent of the
undergraduate enrollment. ‘The
overall win-and-loss records of the
athletic teams was 91 wins, 81 losses,
and four ties.

Both the basketball and lacrosse
teams were invited to participate
in National Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation post-season contests. Wash-
ington and Lee was chosen to be
host of the NCAA Division III
basketball tournament—the first time
Washington and Lee had been se-
lected for this competition. And
the lacrosse team stunned the
sports world by upsetting the na-
tion’s No. 1 team, Johns Hopkins,
in the quarter-finals of the NCAA
tournament. After this 11-7 victory,
the team lost in the semi-finals to
the University of Maryland, which
went on to win the national cham-
pionship. Four lacrosse players
won All-America honors: Rob
Lindsey, first team defense; Dave
Warfied, second team attack; ‘Tommy
Keigler, third team defense; and
Don Carroll, honorable mention
attack.

‘The tennis team had its best
season ever with a 13-2 record. The
team was led by No. 1 singles cham-
pion, John Embree, who won 18 of 24
matches. Embree qualified for the

NCAA tournament and did well,
although he did not win All-America
honors. ‘he golf team also had a
superior record of 13-2, just missing
selection to the NCAA tournament.

Last winter, five swimmers
qualified for the NCAA tournament,
and all five men came out with
All-America honors. Freshmen
swimmer John Hudson was a sen-
sational performer and won AIll-
America status in five different
events. In track, Tony Perry qualifi-
ed for the NCAA tournament, and
in wrestling, Doug Ford did the
same. Both men missed All-America
honors, but performed well in the
NCAA competition.

Last year, the football team
suffered through a dismal season
(1-8-1), although the very young
squad showed much improvement.

Washington and Lee’s overall
athletic programs were helped by
the opening of eight new all-weather
tennis courts just behind the stands
of Wilson Field and the addition
of a new practice field in the area
west of Wilson Field.

Athletic Director William D.
McHenry reports that lights are
urgently needed for the new practice
field and also additional space is
needed for an improved baseball
field or new soccer field. Planning
for future expansion is imperative,
he notes, because of the ever in-
creasing use of athletic facilities for
physical education, intercollegiate
and intramural competition, and
recreation.

BUILDING AND CAMPUS
DEVELOPMENT

The opening this fall of Woods
Creek Apartments, after a year’s
delay, has helped relieve pressure
on housing accommodations for
upperclass and law students. ‘These
commodious apartment units,
situated in three attractive buildings
on the west slope of Woods Creek
Valley, house 178 students. ‘The
buildings are of concrete, finished
in weathered, textured wood panel-
ing that blends harmoniously with
the surroundings. ‘They are an
altogether welcome and pleasing
addition to the campus.

Construction is progressing on
Lewis Hall, the new home of the
School of Law, and the building
should be ready for occupancy by
next fall. This magnificent building
will permit the law school to in-
crease its enrollment by 100 to 350
—determined to be the optimum
size for a law program of the char-
acter of Washington and Lee’s. ‘The
expansion in enrollment will be
accomplished gradually over three
years by admitting first year classes
of 110 to 120 students, rather than
the 80-student classes now admitted.
Tucker Hall, after the law school
moves out, will be renovated for use
by several undergraduate academic
departments which are now scattered
among several buildings because of
space limitations.

 

A new undergraduate library is
urgently needed. Plans for the new
building are virtually complete, but
construction has been delayed by a
lack of funding. The old McCormick
Library building has become ob-
solete because of the impact of the
so-called ‘information explosion,”
involving the ever-increasing intel-
lectual sophistication of the Univer-
sity’s students and teachers, the
dramatic expansion in the size and
scope of the curriculum, and the
demands and opportunities of
technology.

The need for a new undergradu-
ate library is all the more pressing
because of the cramped condition
of the School of Commerce, Eco-
nomics, and Politics in Newcomb
Hall. The Commerce School would
move into a renovated McCormick
Hall after a new library building
is completed and occupied. Newcomb
Hall would then be freed to provide
much needed space in other academ-
ic areas.

The opening of new tennis
courts and a new athletic practice
field has already been noted. New
appealingly landscaped parking
lots have been installed below the
addition to Doremus Gymnasium,
and work continues on new access
roads to Woods Creek Apartments
and Lewis Hall. The planting
around existing buildings of many
full-grown English boxwoods, the
generous gift of Wilmer S. Poynor
of Birmingham, Ala., is enhancing
the beauty of the campus.

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

In 1972, the University an-
nounced a $56-million development
program for the decade of the
1970s, with an initial objective of
$36 million by the Bicentennial
Year 1976. These funds are par-
ticularly needed for increased en-
dowment, new buildings, and aug-
mented student financial aid. Pro-
gress toward completing the 1976
objective is reported fully elsewhere
in this publication. But it should
be heartening to all alumni and
friends of Washington and Lee to
note that, as of June 30, 1975, gift
commitments totalling $27,597,925
or 76.7 per cent of the $36-million
objective have been made. ‘The
University*is deeply grateful to all
contributors. This overall significant
progress holds promise that the
development task can be completed
successfully. Three specific areas of
concern remain: endowment en-
largement is not keeping pace with
need; a $2-million funding gap for
the addition to the gymnasium re-
mains; and, as previously mentioned,
lack of funding has delayed con-
struction of a new undergraduate
library.

No less encouraging is the pro-
gress of Washington and Lee’s
annual giving programs in support
of current expenses. The 1974-75

Alumni Fund reached a record high
of $505,204. This amount was
$35,204 over the goal and $82,439
more than was raised last year, an
increase of 19.5 per cent. This dis-
play of faith in Washington and
Lee by its alumni is tangible evidence
that the University can face the
future with strength and confidence.
One notable gift received during
1974-75 deserves mention—the $1.5-
million gift of Miss Ruth Parmly of
New York City to the University’s
endowment to maintain and
strengthen its programs in the
sciences with special emphasis on
physics, physics-engineering, and
mathematics. ‘The gift honors her
father, the late Charles Howard
Parmly, who was a revered teacher
of physics and engineering at the
College of the City of New York
and the founder of CCNY’s engi-
neering school. In recognition of
the gift, Washington and Lee has
named the building housing the
biology, physics, and physics-engineer-
ing departments, Parmly Hall.
Washington and Lee’s gratitude to
Miss Parmly is unbounded.

FINANCES

In 1974-75, Washington and Lee
again operated in the black. This is
no small accomplishment during a
time of mounting energy costs,
inflation, and a depressed economy.

But it should be noted that for
the first time in recent history the
budget projected for 1975-76 re-
flects an imbalance of $60,317 of
expenditures over anticipated re-
venue. ‘There is a continuous ef-
fort to hold down expenses, and
the hope is that this budgeted
deficit will be eliminated by reduc-
tions in expenditures and added
sources of revenue. (The 1975-76
budget is set forth in an accompany-
ing table.)

In 1974-75, the University’s
Educational and General revenue
and expenditure budget was $6,275,-
247, and its total operational budget
came to $8,460,401. (See accompany-
ing table). Put another way, this
means that it costs $23,179 per day
to operate the University over a
period of a calendar year.

Of its total Educational and
General income, the University
receives 62 per cent from tuition
and fees; 14 per cent from endow-
ment; 16 per ceut from trusts,
special, and corporate gifts; 8 per
cent from the Alumni Fund for
unrestricted purposes for current

to feel a severe pinch. In recent
years, Washington and Lee was able
to give financial assistance, in the
full amount of need, to any admited
student who without assistance
would be unable to attend the Uni-
versity. Now because of the increas-
ing strain on financial aid resources
the University must reluctantly turn
down many students it would like
to help.

Clearly, Washington and Lee is
dependent upon yearly gifts to stay

in the black. ‘This year, for example,
the University’s Educational and
General expense is budgeted at
$6,863,450. Of this amount,
$5,765,133 is expected to be covered
by tuition, earnings on endowment,
and income from trusts, non-endow-
ment funds, and other miscellane-
ous sources. ‘The difference of
$1,098,317 must come from gifts.

ALUMNI AFFAIRS

During 1974-75, the Alumni
Board of Directors, through the
agency of a special committee, con-
ducted a self-study aimed at discover-
ing ways of improving all phases
of the alumni program. ‘The study
resulted in many recommendations
designed to bind alumni even
closer to their alma mater. Major
efforts are being made to revitalize
alumni chapter activities, to improve
class organization, to make class
reunions more attractive, to identify
and recruit alumni leaders at the
local level, and to improve all
forms of communication between
alumni and the University. One
major recommendation was put
into effect last spring—the appoint-
ment of J. Martin Bass, ’70, as As-
sistant Alumni Secretary with special
responsibilities for alumni chapter
activities. Other recommendations
of the study committee are being
gradually phased into the alumni
program as the Alumni Board
continues to study the report.

BICENTENNIAL PROGRAMS

The American Revolution Bi-
centennial Administration has de-
signated Washington and Lee a
“Bicentennial College Campus.”
The University’s programs in ob-
servance of the nation’s 200th an-
niversary of independence cluster
around its own heritage, some of the
historical treasures it owns which
illustrate the early history of the
United States, and its plans to
preserve and enhance its traditional
position of strength in American
education.

Among the programs connected
with the Bicentennial celebration
are these:

The nationwide tour currently
under way of a number of historic
portraits once owned by the families
of George Washington and Robert
E. Lee, including the famous first
portrait of Washington by Charles
Willson Peale; another two-year
tour of about 200 pieces of rare
Chinese export porcelain from the
University’s Reeves Collection,
circa eighteenth and early-nine-
teenth centuries, with decorations
that reflect Revolutionary-era politi-
cal, cultural, religious, and aesthetic
influences; the extensive profes-
sional archaeological excavations
at the ruins of Liberty Hall.

A major program to preserve
permanently many of the existing

records pertaining to the Univer-
sity’s earliest history; an arrangement
with Wamsutta Mills to receive a
royalty in support of the Univer-
sity’s educational program from
sales of linens which Wamsutta de-
veloped from patterns found in
the Reeves Collection of Chinese
export porcelain; finely crafted
reproductions of nine pieces from
the Reeves Collection by arrange-
ment with European porcelain manu-
facturers, the sales of which will
similarly result in a royalty for the
University’s educational program.
The 1976 Mock Convention
staged by Washington and Lee’s
student body, already recognized
by the Virginia Bicentennial Com-
mission as an official Bicentennial
event; a large number of on-campus
programs and research activities,
ranging from a production next
year of the Broadway musical 1776
to the extensive studies of the early
rectors and other figures in the
pre-Lee history of the University;
and completion in 1976 of the $36-
million first-phase objective of
Washington and Lee’s development
program for the 1970s.

FRIENDS

Washington and Lee receives each
year many gifts in support of current
operations from persons whose rela-
tionship to the University is that of
“friends.” Most of these gifts are
unrestricted, either as direct grants
or in the form of memorials. Some
are designated for student aid to be
awarded during the academic year.
These gifts are a source of support
for which the University is deeply
grateful.

In the list below, the heading
“Lee Associate” refers to gifts of
$1,000 or more made in 1974-75; the
heading “Colonnade Club” refers to
gifts of $100-$999 made in 1974-75.

The University’s friends in the
business and industrial community
contributed a significant 14.3% of the
total gift income received for sup-
port of current operations in 1974-75.
As always, the cornerstone of this sup-
port in 1974-75 was the $121,994 re-
ceived through the statewide program
of solicitation carried out by the Vir-
ginia Foundation for Independent
Colleges. Under the direction of a
board that includes 33 business lead-
ers and the presidents of the 12 in-
dependent member colleges, this or-
ganization enlisted the support of
963 Virginia business establishments
to raise a total of $1,324,426—the
highest amount in history—for pri-
vate higher education in Virginia.
During 1974-75, President Robert E.
R. Huntley of Washington and Lee
had the privilege of being president
of the VFIC.

The remainder of the contribu-
tions from business and industry
came in the form of direct grants and
matching gifts made through pro-
grams especially designed to aid in-
dependent colleges.

THE ESTATE PLANNING PROGRAM

Over the years many of those who believe in the
educational mission of Washington and Lee have
chosen to commit a portion of their resources to the
successful continuation of that mission. By including
Washington and Lee among the beneficiaries of their
estates they have made a perpetual record of their
belief in the importance of a university of this kind
and have put their imprint on the future.

Many of these supporters of Washington and Lee
have been its alumni, but many others have not been.
One of the latter was Dr. John Cole.

Dr. Cole, a 1908 graduate of the University of
Virginia’s Medical School, practiced medicine in
Fredericksburg, Virginia for more than 60 years. A
bachelor, Dr. Cole was very close throughout his life
to his brother William B. F. Cole. “Billy’’ Cole ob-
tained his law degree from Washington and Lee
in 1920, and for almost 40 years he also practiced his
profession in Fredericksburg, where he died in 1964.

When John Cole died 10 years later, Washington
and Lee learned, to its surprise, that he had bequeathed
to it one-third of his estate, to be used by the School
of Law as a memorial to his brother “Billy.”

During the most recent fiscal year, distributions
made to Washington and Lee from the estates of Dr.
Cole and other benefactors amounted to $589,919.43.
This brings to more than $3.5 million the amount of
new capital that has come to the University in the
past three years from the estates of alumni and friends.

Last year the names of Christopher Chenery, ’09,
Richard Gooch, ’30, Lee Grabill, 14, ‘Thomas Standi-
fer, 19, and Marjorie Hix (widow of Edward Hix,
’17) were added, with Dr. Cole’s, to the long record
of those who, through the generations, have shared
their estates with Washington and Lee. The Uni-
versity, as it exists today, is a monument to these
men and women.

Familiar campus buildings—Doremus Gymnasium,
duPont and Robinson Halls and Evans Dining Hall
among them—bear the names of those who shared a
belief in the great heritage and continued strength of
this University and recognized its needs when they
planned the disposition of their estates. ‘The library
in Lewis Hall, the striking new home of the School
of Law, will be named for the late Wilbur C. Hall,

52

 

MARTIN P. Burks, 32
Chairman
Estate Planning Council

 

’"15L, whose bequest of more than $1 million for that
purpose is one of the largest ever received by the
University.

Less visible memorials, but of equal permanence
and importance to the life of the University, are those
additions to endowment for scholarships, for pro-
fessorships, and for general support that have
come from the estates of numerous alumni and friends.

Supporters have informed the University of
existing provisions for its benefit in wills, insurance
programs, or through living trusts that some day will
add their principal to its endowment funds. ‘These
statements of support, which total about $3,000,000,
are tremendously helpful to the University in plan-
ning for its role in educating generations to come.
They are tremendously encouraging as expressions of
confidence in what is being done at Washington and
Lee and its importance for the future.

Many of these gifts which will come to the Uni-
versity will be relatively small in size just as many
of those made in the past have been. Some will be
very substantial and will enable one donor or one
family to bring to completion an entire project.
Each is of equal value as a statement of faith—faith
in a philosophy of education that has produced
leaders for more than two centuries, that takes its
inspiration from the past and looks with hopeful
determination to the future.

Sharing one’s estate with Washington and Lee is
a way of influencing that future, of assuring that
one’s work is never done and one’s ideals are forever
remembered. There is no better tribute to this Uni-
versity, memorial to oneself, or benefaction to pos-
terity.

Washington and Lee encourages all its alumni to
consider seriously the place of the University in
their long-range financial planning. Through the
office of University Development it stands ready to as-
sist you and your advisors in making the plan that
best suits you, your family’s situation and the Uni-
versity’s needs. When a provision for its benefit has
been made, the University hopes that it will be notified
in order that its planning for the future may be eased.
All such communications are, of course, held in the
strictest confidence.
