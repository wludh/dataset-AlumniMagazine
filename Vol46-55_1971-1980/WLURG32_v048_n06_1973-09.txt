On the Cover: They came in a bus, these Boy
Scouts, to visit Lee Chapel and its museum. Many
had cameras and photographed their comrades as
they trooped into the famous shrine. This is a
scene repeated many times throughtout the year,
but particularly in the summer when thousands of
tourists visit the campus. The pictures on the first
four pages of this issue of WeL are a sampler of
the tourist atmosphere during the summer months.

~ When summer comes to W&L,

so do tourists-and welcome!

Summertime is visiting time, and Washington and
Lee gets its full share of tourists. They come in
pairs; they come in families of three, four, five, Six
or more; they often come by the busful. ‘hey come
by the thousands over a period of months, attracted
by a historic campus of sylvan beauty and peace.
Lee Chapel, the burial place of Robert E. Lee—
his shrine, really—is the principal tourist mecca.
But visitors are likely to stroll elsewhere, sampling
the charm of the Colonnade, reading a plaque here
and there, pausing for a look around the foyer of
Washington Hall, circling around the back campus,
or just sitting for a few moments on a bench in the
shade of an ancient campus tree. Nearly all have
cameras, and Washington and Lee is surely one of the
most photographed campuses in the country. Visitors
to Washington and Lee are ever welcome. And they
may be expected in greater numbers since the campus
has been designated a National Historic Land-
mark. The photographs on these pages attempt to
capture a bit of the tourist scene at Washington
and Lee.

 

NATIONAL Historic LANDMARK CEREMONY
The ceremony designating Washington and Lee's
campus a National Historic Landmark will be
held at 4:30 p.m., Friday, October 12, 1973, on
the Front Campus. The ceremony is, of course,
open to all alumni and friends.

 

 

 

The statue of Cyrus McCormick on the Front
Campus is often believed to be one of Robert E.
Lee until close inspection reveals otherwise.
These three visitors by moving in close learn the
facts.

The famous Recumbent Statue of Lee by the
sculptor, Edward Valentine, is a prime attraction
in Lee Chapel. The boy with the camera will have
a picture of the statue for the family album.

 

 

 

A stroll down the sun-spangled Colonnade
offers tourists an opportunity to experience
the daily pleasure of W&L students.

 

Standing under the ivy-clad tree in front of Lee
Chapel, a visitor aims his camera at the build-
ings on the Hill—an irrestible scene for
photographers.

- The racing silks of The Meadow:

color them W&L blue and white

 

When you watched the Derby
and the Belmont and the Preakness
this year—and then the big Secretariat /
Riva Ridge invitational Sept. 15—
did something seem vaguely familiar
about the star performers?

It should have. Their racing silks
are Washington and Lee blue and
white.

The late Christopher T. Chenery
designated the colors of his alma
mater to symbolize his stable—The
Meadow, which he founded in 1936.
Chenery, who died last Jan. 3, was
a 1909 engineering graduate of the
University and served as a ‘Trustee
from 1950 until his retirement in
1970. His dedication to W&L has
long standing: he was largely re-
sponsible for the success of the 1949
University Bicentennial, and he was
chairman of the 1958-60 fund-raising
program for new science facilities
and the renovation of Reid Hall.

He was a utilities magnate by
profession—founder and president of
Federal Water & Gas Corp., board
chairman of Southern Natural Gas,
president or chairman of seven smaller
utilities, and a director of seven
others—but his passion was for horse-
racing. The Meadow bred Riva
Ridge, last year’s Kentucky Derby
winner, and Secretariat, the first
Triple Crown winner in a quarter-
century. And, like Hildene and
Cicada and First Landing and Hill
Prince and all the other Meadow
standouts before them, they raced in
the colors of the Generals—for
Washington and Lee was another of
Chenery’s loves.

Calvert Thomas—incoming Alumni Fund chairman.

September, 1973

a
a .
w

 

Agent, Vernon W. Holleman, Jr., of
Washington, D. C., will receive the trophy
for his class at Fall Reunions, Oct. 19-20.

The impact of the Richmond Trophy
may be seen in these figures: Last year,
only one academic class achieved better
than 40% participation; this year, 16
classes had 40% participation or better.

Participation in the Alumni Fund is
expected to be further stimulated by the
establishment of two additional trophies,
the Washington Trophy and the Bierer
Trophy, for outstanding support of the
fund. These trophies and the 1972-73
winners are reported in an accompanying
article.

The 1972 Report of Gifts to be pub-
lished in October will contain a full re-
port on the 1972-73 Alumni Fund as well
as reports on the University’s other an-
nual giving programs and the Develop-
ment Program for the 1970's.

 

New Fund Officers

Calvert Thomas, ’38, of New York,
secretary and assistant general counsel of
General Motors Corp., is the new chair-
man of the Washington and Lee Alumni
Fund. On July 1, he succeeded James H.
Bierer, *40, of Pittsburgh, who headed
the fund effort for two years.

 

Thomas, as fund chairman, will rep-
resent the fund in all of its general con-
tacts with alumni and in the formulation
of alumni giving plans in close coopera-
tion with W&L’s alumni and develop-
ment offices.

Thomas’ goal will be to continue the
rise that the fund achieved under the
leadership of Bierer, the University’s first
fund chairman. The fund increased 36%
during the two years Bierer held the post.

Thomas’ appointment was announced
by William H. Hillier, ’38, of Chicago,

7

 

president of the Alumni Association. Hil-
lier, Thomas, and Bierer met in Lexing-
ton in late June to prepare for the change
in the chairmanship.

Thomas served last year as fund vice
chairman for the Academic Classes 1935-
48. This year, he will have the assistance
of seven vice chairmen, three of them
new to the fund organization.

The new vice chairmen are L. Gor-
don Miller, Jr., 45, of Richmond, execu-
tive vice president and director of Wheat,
First Securities, Inc.; J. Carter Fox, 61, of
West Point, Va., controller and assistant
treasurer of The Chesapeake Corp. of

 

J. Carter Fox
8

 

Virginia; and James M. Ballengee, ‘48L,
of Philadelphia, president and chairman
of the Philadelphia Surburban Corp.

Miller is vice chairman for the Academ-
ic Classes 1935-48; Fox for the Academic
Classes 1961-73; and Ballengee for the
Law Classes 1924-51.

Continuing as vice chairmen this year
are Alumni Secretary William C. Wash-
burn for the Old Guard (classes that were
at W&L more than 50 years ago); Herbert
G. Jahncke, 730, of New Orleans for the
Academic Classes 1924-34; Oliver M. Men-
dell, ’50, of New York for the Academic
Classes 1949-60; and John S. Stump, III,

John S. Stump, II

L. Gordon Miller, Jr.

 

 

’57L, of Alexandria, Va., for the Law
Classes 1952-73.

In announcing Thomas’ appointment,
Hillier said annual contributions through
the Alumni Fund are a major factor in
enabling the University to operate with a
balanced budget. Annual Alumni Fund
support, he said, represents more than
half of the $7.85-million goal for support
of current operating expenses in W&L’s
$56-million Development Program.

Thomas joined the General Motors
legal staff in 1946, became assistant gen-
eral counsel in 1972, and secretary of the
corporation in 1973.

the academic requirements and is expected to return for the
Fall ‘Term. The eight were among those receiving degrees from
Washington and Lee on May 31.

All of the 10 students who were indicted entered pleas of
guilty to all counts. Seven of the 10 as of mid-July were serving
jail sentences, ranging from 60 days to two years. Fines in the
cases ranged from $500 to $7,000. In addition, all received
varying terms of probation. The three who were not in jail, in-
cluding the junior, received suspended terms in addition to
paying fines.

In sum, this matter of great complexity and difficulty was
considered by various individuals, committees, and bodies in
the University community during the past year. ‘There was no
precedent to their actions, and there was no “right” or “good”
way to deal with the various aspects of the problem.

For the reasons outlined, no disciplinary or other punitive
action was taken by the University against those individuals
indicted and convicted on drug distribution charges. Hope-
fully, as one result of this year’s experience, policy and pro-
cedures can be clarified as a guide for future action.

 

University Policy Statement on Drugs
Washington and Lee University wants to help the

individual achieve a realistic understanding of the con-
sequences of drug use and the ability to make informed,
responsible decisions. The University’s prime responsibi-
lities concerning drugs are education and counseling.
Consistent with these responsibilities, the University
wishes to create an environment in which students may
discuss drug problems openly and without fear of re-
prisal. The University, to foster this environment, will
sponsor regular seminars on drugs and drug use as well
as offer counseling assistance at all times. In addition,
McCormick Library and the University Center will
maintain special collections of literature on drugs.

Students sincerely interested in resolving personal
drug problems may seek guidance from University physi-
cians, the Dean of Students, and his staff; in seeking
such aid, students may rest assured they do not risk dis-
ciplinary action. Although conversations with these per-
sons do not enjoy immunity from court inquiry, they are
under no obligation to initiate reporting of drug offenses
and would do so only in clearly dangerous and extra-
ordinary situations.

Although the enforcement of law is not within the
educational function of the University, no one should
delude himself that the campus is a sanctuary from law-
enforcement agents. Society regulates by the law the use
of drugs; it forbids even the possession of certain drugs.
Law-enforcement agents have jurisdiction on campus
and, when possessing proper documents, may legally

make arrests or search any room or building without
prior notice to University officials. Moreover, the Univer-
sity cannot intervene to protect an accused person from
the consequences of his arrest or conviction. Whether he
is on or off campus, a student is subject to the law.

Washington and Lee University does not wish to set
student against student, or faculty against student, to
ferret out offenders; to do so would undermine the edu-
cational enterprise. Nevertheless, the University cannot
ignore violations which come to its attention; that would
deny society its legitimate claim that we abide by the
law and would invite others to undertake the enforce-
ment we, ourselves, would not provide. Allegations of
drug misuse will be considered by the Student Control
Committee.

As in other matters of student conduct, the Student
Control Committee’s jurisdiction and concern extend
over the Washington and Lee student whether he is on
this campus, in the local community, or visiting other
colleges and universities. In arriving at its decisions, the
Student Control Committee will examine the particular
circumstances of each case and consider the interests of
the individual and the University. One principle, how-
ever, does seem clear: An individual who uses drugs is
responsible for his actions; an individual who makes
illegal drugs available to others is responsible not only
for his own actions, but for the actions and welfare of
others as well. Accordingly, the severity of the penalty
may depend upon the degree to which an individual’s
action affects the interests of others.
