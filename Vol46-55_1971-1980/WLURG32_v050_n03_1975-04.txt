ON THE COVER: House Mountain is the back-
drop for this panoramic view of the new develop-
ments in and across Woods Creek Valley. At the
lower right behind the trees is the new heating-
cooling plant, which will serve the new and exist-
ing buildings. Just above it, Lewis Hall, the new
home of the School of Law, is taking final shape.
At the lower left is one of the three units of Woods
Creek Apartments, which will house 178 upper-
class and law students next fall. The new campus
map on the inside back cover shows the relation-
ship of these new buildings to the existing cam-
pus. Photograph by Sally Mann.

Washington and Lee Trustee John M. Stemmons is,
by any measure, one of the men who have made Dallas,
Texas, the eighth largest city in the nation—a great,
bustling, proud civic, cultural, and industrial center—
a metropolis he affectionately calls “my village.”

Stemmons’ language is as colorful as the glittering
land in which he lives. Some say he resembles John
Wayne, sounds like Tex Ritter, and behaves like LBJ.
But these are fleeting impressions. John Stemmons is
pure John Stemmons.

He throws around a lot of “damns” and “hells”
(terms of emphasis), talks of “knocking heads together”’
and “blood running in the gutter” and “hustling
money” and “being a bagman” (his way of describing
how things are accomplished and financed). His favorite
form of address is “cousin,” and a “cookie” is anyone
who is alive and kicking. He stands taller than six feet
and is an altogether awe-inspiring figure. But no one

can listen to his plain talk and unvarnished commen-
taries without warming to his incisive mind, contagious
personality, and humanness.

Pin him down on his philosophy of life. (he is an
Episcopal lay leader), and he is likely to say: “Well,
cousin, my prayer is, ‘Dear Lord, keep me from vanity
and hypocrisy and let me understand humility.’ That’s
about as far as I can go on that.”

John Stemmons is not the total ‘Texan he might ap-
pear to be. A large slice of him reposes in Virginia and
is dedicated to the welfare of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity.

“It’s a hell of a good school,” he is wont to say. But
there is much more to the Stemmons-Washington and
Lee love affair than that.

Stemmons has been a member of the Board of
Trustees since 1965, a job he hesitated to take because it
was then a life-time post (six-year terms were later ef-

]

fected) and also primarily, he says, because ‘“‘of the mere
fact that I had not graduated.” He fortunately overcame
those qualms.

Today, Stemmons is chairman of the University’s
Achievement Council—that all-important group of
Trustees and other Washington and Lee leaders who
are spearheading Washington and Lee’s development
program for the decade of the 1970s. The initial goal is
$36 million by the end of the Bicentennial year 1976.
The funds are earmarked for desperately needed new
plant—particularly a new undergraduate library—addi-
tions to the endowment, and, through annual giving, for
current operations. So far, nearly $27.5 million has been
raised toward the initial goal.

Can the goal be reached? Stemmons is optimistic and
determined: |

“I say yes. We will make it. It’s going to take some
blood, sweat, and tears, some head-beating, a hell of a
lot of traveling, and a lot of cajoling. But there is no
question in my mind about it. The very fact that we
have gotten as far as we have is indicative of success.”

When John Stemmons speaks of success, he knows
what he is talking about. Success is the hallmark of his
career, and it is almost a proverb in Dallas\ that what-
ever John Stemmons sets his mind and heart to suc-
ceeds. The lean days and disappointments in his life
have served only to make success all the sweeter.

Stemmons was born and reared in Dallas. His grand-
father, a Confederate veteran, settled in Dallas in 1868
and established a law practice. He also became involved
in land development and sealed the family’s destiny.
Stemmons’ father, Leslie, studied law, became a land
developer and in the early 1920s had a great vision—the
reclamation and clearing of 10,500 acres of bottom land
along the Trinity River right in the heart of Dallas,
land that was virtually useless because of frequent flood-
ing. Leslie Stemmons worked mightily at the task until
the Trinity was rechanneled and tamed by levees. He
put together the most important pieces of land into a
corporation to be developed as an industrial district—a
pioneering concept in those days.

Meanwhile, John Stemmons, his two brothers, and a
sister were growing up. Storey, the eldest of the tribe,
who was later to work side by side with John in bring-
ing the Trinity River Industrial District to fruition,

»

went off to Washington and Lee and studied law. He
had been attracted to the school by his infatuation with
Southern lore and by the good reports of a cousin who
had attended W&L. Storey graduated with a law degree
in 1927, and that fall John entered Washington and Lee.

John says he was a “‘sorry student” and “never stud-
ied and just played around and had more fun than a
showdog.” He claims that he was “thrown out 30 or 40
times for bad grades and other malfeasances.” But if he
did not get a degree, he did acquire other things he
values even more highly.

“Book learning is fine,” he says. “It teaches you
some discipline. But the most important thing to me at
W&L was the association I had with students from all
over the country, men with different ideas and different
viewpoints. It gave me a breadth of thinking that I
have always been most grateful for. No one goes to
Washington and Lee without coming away with a
broadened concept and broadened vision of life.”

And he found a wife—the former Ruth Thomas,
sister of John Newton Thomas, rector emeritus of the
Board of Trustees, and of Bill Thomas, John’s room-
mate at Washington and Lee. Thereby hangs a tale:

John was a “long, skinny boy” who tried to play foot-
ball at W&IL. One day after the regular season he was
playing with a group of students on the lawn across
the street from the Beta House, and one redheaded
boy who “was as agile as can be” was “kind of running
rough shod over the gang.” John didn’t like that and
“decided to let him have it.” He grabbed the ball on a
pass and tore out. But the redhead left his feet and
threw himself into the side of John’s back, breaking off
five of the tips of John’s vertebrate.

“I tell you I thought the world had come to an end,”
he recalls. “They had to tape me up and take me to
Charlottesville and put me in a cast.”

So instead of going home for Christmas that year he
went across the mountain to Bedford, Va., and spent
the holidays with his roommate Bill Thomas. There he
met and fell in love with Ruth and eventually married
her.

“I brought her to Texas 43 years ago. She looks out
her window every morning for her mountains and they
ain’t there,” he says. “But she is about to become recon-
ciled.”

Stemmons shows a visitor some of the aerial photographs thal

high-rise Stemmons Towers, where John Stemmons pre-
sides over the affairs of Industrial Properties Corp. ‘The
windows of his office offer a spectacular view to the
south of the Dallas skyline.

Storey Stemmons died five years ago, and John says,
“T miss the old man (his pet name for Storey) tremen-
dously.”” He notes that while he no longer has a W&L
man as his closest associate in the business he does have
the father of a W&L graduate in Lee Halford, who be-
came president of the corporation in early March. Stem-
mons who had been president since 1945 became chair-
man of the board. Halford is the father of Lee Halford
Jr.. who graduated from W&L in 1969, did graduate
work at the University of Texas, and is now employed
by the Stemmons corporation.

All through the years that Stemmons labored for his
corporation he also gave a great deal of time to CiV1C
endeavors relating to the overall development of Dallas.

“A city is as healthy as its people make it,” he ex-
plains. “Dallas has been good to my family and to me,
and I have always felt an obligation to do what I could
for it and have probably participated in a lot more
than I had any business doing.”

The same year he became president of the corpora-
tion he was elected president of the Dallas Real Estate
Board and a year later was awarded the Easterwood Cup
for outstanding sales achievement and development by
the Dallas Board of Realtors. Within a decade he was
named Texas Realtor of the Year by the State Associa-
tion.

trace 30 years of progress in the Trinity River Industrial District.

 

 

 

 

 

In 1967, he received one of the city’s most coveted
recognitions, the Linz Award for outstanding commun-
ity service.

The sales and marketing executives of Dallas ac-
corded him the chapter’s highest professional honor by
naming him Dallas’ Distinguished Salesman for 1971.
And in 1972 the Dallas Press Club honored him as the
city’s All-Time Headliner, citing “his many selfless en-
deavors to make Dallas a better place in which to live,
work, and serve. Some of his achievements:

Board chairman of the Dallas County Flood Control
District (1945-70); vice president and director, Dallas
Chamber of Commerce (1954-63); vice president, ‘Texas
Real Estate Association (1954); Layman of the Year-1956,
the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas; president, Greater Dal-
las Council of Churches (1963); president, Dallas Citi-
zens Council (1964); president, Dallas Rotary Club
(1964-65); general campaign chairman, Dallas County
United Fund (1965); president, Better Business Bureau,
(1967-68); president, Greater Dallas Planning Council
(1975).

He is a director of the Dr Pepper Co., Southland
Financial Corp., Republic National Bank of Dallas,
Dallas Power and Light Co., vice president of the State
Fair of Texas, Trinity Improvement Association and
the Southwest Medical Foundation, and a trustee or
director of the Hoblitzelle Foundation, Dallas Citizens
Council, Dallas County United Way, Gaston Episcopal
Hospital, and Children’s Medical Center.

He is also a director of a non-profit foundation which

will build and operate Thanks-Giving Square, a na-
tional shrine to America’s oldest tradition. The shrine,

located on a 3% acre tract in downtown Dallas, will ©
have a bell tower, fountains, and a chapel—a Bicenten-

nial gift to the nation from the city of Dallas.

Still, over the years, Stemmons has somehow found
the time as a W&L trust ,
many working hours to th
of the University. He «

versity officials, architects, and lar

 

  
   
  

his words ‘ ‘supposed to be the chief money hustler.”
And as with his civic work in Dallas, he works for W&L
out of a sense of obligation. —

“I fell in love with Virginia when I was 5 there,” he
says, “and I am still very enamored of it. Having two
brothers-in-law and one brother who were minks, I have
always had a real deep feeling for the school. ‘I feel it
has been most constructive in the development of the
kind of character that I am.” |

Stemmons has seen many changes occur at Washing:
ton and Lee since he went on the Board. In general, he
has no quarrel with most of that change. He is sadden-
ed, he says, by the deterioration in student dress and
manners, although he understands changes in student
life, requirements and demands “have been a fluctuating
thing like everything else.” He says change is “not
necessarily abhorrent to people, but drastic change in
tradition is not a desired thing.” He feels that Washing-
ton and Lee is dedicated to preserving its basic tradi-

tions such as its emphasis of honor among men and

respect for the individual. He visits the campus fre-
quently and sees, he says, “a greater respect for tradition

and for the normal courtesies of life i in the student body |

today than I saw three or four years ago.”

John M. Stemmons

 

“Two things will kill Washington and Lee quicker

_ than anything else. One is the idea of getting large. I |
- fought very hard against setting down the condition that

the school might go to 2,000 students. I think that would

be very bad. I hope it stays around 1,600, where it is
~ now. And, God knows, coeducation would kill ‘Washing.
ton and Lee in five years. There is nothing in Lexing-

ton to attract: students who want to” be in coeducational :

| institutions. Nothing: at all. You have, all the git’

 

‘As to. the physical. changes taking pees Stemmons

says with | confidence, “You are not going to have a

valid complaint about the planning or the architectural
design.” He feels Woods Creek ravine and “the go
ous land” across it are. great assets. He says the archi-

 

 tectural style of the principal new buildings—the new
law school, Lewis Hall, across the ravine, the student

apartments in the ravine, and the planned new library—
is “no great departure” from the traditional style of the
Colonnade and is actually “a modern conception of it.”
He says the architects have cooperated with “our insis-
tence on the beauty of plainness and simplicity.” All of |
the developments, he feels, will have a “feeling of kin-
ship” with existing structures, - 7 /
“So I am very pleased with the plans that we put =

 

 
  
   
  
 
  
 
    
   

hope someday that there could be a theater built on the —

top of what I call Pine Mountain overlooking the Maury —
River that could be used by the communi ty, VMI, and

W&L. It would be very fine to have something uke
that.” | -
One significant change for the better, he notes, is
a diminishing of the notion among alumni and others
that Washington and Lee is “fairly well heeled and has _
no financial problems.” He feels that the success thus f 1
of the development program—particularly the $9-million —
gift to the law school of Frances and Sydney Le
very fact that it was made—has “jolted people an
them understand the necessity of making si ni

 

 

 

 

 

 

a

 

gilts to W&L.””

   
  

Ask Stemmons what Washington and Lee’s No. 1
| priority is and he says emphatically: “It’s get-
pone) to build a new library. That’s very -

 

n 0 fap
“Tt is very difficult to raise money for Washington

and Lee because we are scattered to the four winds,”

 
 

 

have not been able to get myself or others to hit the road
and get this job done. We will. I feel sure we will.”
_ Stemmons feels that the ¢ oe ir

    
 

of prospects y in , er yily in

includes all. a opine et period. It — annual
giving as well as gifts of a substantial nature made on a
one-time basis.”

He believes strongly that annual giving must go
hand in hand with the capital campaign to increase en-

dowment and finance new buildings:

“Without any question, annual giving | ‘is the life’s
blood of any institution. Through annual giving, you~

get not only financial support for day-to-day operations,

but you also get the moral support you must have. If
you don’t get both of these. things, the institution 1s_

going to falter.”
Does Washington and Lee’ S future really y depend on
the success of the current campaign?

“Well, it is ludicrous to say that the school would
fold up in the event that we fail to get the last million
dollars. But it is essential to say that the money has to
be collected. The endowment has to be increased. An-
nual giving has to be maintained. Interest has to be per-
petuated ‘particularly among alumni if Washington and
Lee is to prevail in years to come. The soothsayers have

| sibility for the school’s future: |

“need to see is so difficult. This is my great dereliction. I.

indicated that private schools cannot survive 15 or 20
years from now. I think that is wrong. I think private
schools can survive. But they must have the support that

- good student

 

is required to maintain a good faculty, a

body, and the necessary bolts and nuts that go with it.”
avy Tespon-

th of the program ‘this will improve con-
7 siderably and make i it easier r for | persons to jar themselves ©
loose from their corpus to make Ral gifts to the
school.”

What is Stemmons’ approach. to persuading people
to put Washington and Lee at the top of their list
of priorities?

_ “All of us have a debt to the school. We were all
subsidized when we went there whether we paid the

full tuition or not by virtue of past endowments that —
started with George way back yonder. In my opinion, 90

per cent of the people who have gone there have been
very happy there. And as they reminisce and look back
on what they've done they can’t help but realize a

great obligation to the institution. That has to. boos .
to their attention.” |

- Ask John Stemmons, who will be 66 in July, to look

back on all the honors he has received for his accom-

plishments and say which one gave him the greatest

satisfaction, and he will say:

“Cousin, you can get puffed up over awards and that
sort of thing. But in the final analysis awards come to
you because of things that other people helped you do.”

The people of Dallas know that side of Stemmons

well, and increasingly so do the people of W&L.

As of April 15, gift commitments totalling
$27,211,988 or 75.6 per cent of the $36 million Phase
I financial objective of the Washington and Lee
Development Program have been obtained. Special
attention is called to the list of leadership gifts of
$100,000 or more listed on Page 4 of this report. These
gifts have provided 78.10 per cent of our present
total commitments.

However, substantial numbers of individuals who
have never been asked for their commitments are still
to be reached. We are about to go into the final stretch,
and a large job remains to be done if we are to complete
this phase of the program successfully as our Bicen-
tennial achievement in 1976.

One of our University’s greatest strengths—the wide
geographic distribution of its students, and hence of
its alumni—is a real hurdle when it comes to raising
money. Our people are scattered to the four winds.
The problem of getting around to talk with all of those
whom our Achievement Council members need to see
personally in order properly to discuss leadership gift
opportunities is very difficult.

A way has now been found to confront this difficulty.
It is our great pleasure to announce that six of our
alumni, whose class years range from ’37 to 69, have

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
PROGRESS REPORT

agreed to take substantial leaves of absence—for a
period of several months—from their regular endeavors
to serve the Washington and Lee Development Program
as Staff Associates. Their names and pictures and a bit
of information about them follow this report. They
will be working closely with our Board of Trustees and
our Achievement Council members in getting this im-
portant work accomplished.

As we have stressed before, annual giving must go
hand in hand with those larger gifts which serve to
increase endowment and finance new buildings and
renovations. Without question, annual giving, which
is an integral part of the $36,000,000 objective, is the
life’s blood of this institution. It builds moral support
as well as financial support for day-to-day operations.
With doom being preached by many for private
institutions, the notable activity of our Alumni Fund
Class Agents and the continuing success of our annual
giving program encourage us to believe that Wash-
ington and Lee will prevail in the years to come.

DeJarnette said he is grateful to the
principal officers of his firm for their
awareness of the desirability of accepting
responsibility such as he is assuming.

“In our business we find you get
ahead by taking on more rather than
giving up something,” he said, and that
will be his approach to doing both jobs.
He added that he feels a debt of grati-
tude to the University, having made some
close personal friends while here ‘‘whose
friendship makes life a genuine pleasure
a lot of the time.” He said the good re-
sults he has experienced as a Class Agent
has made him “very optimistic” about the
University’s ability to complete the de-
velopment program.

Williamson has had an outstanding
career in banking and has held many
positions of leadership in the U. S.
Chamber of Commerce, serving on the
International Committee and the Task
Force on Multinational Corporations and
the Task Force on Reverse Investments
in the U. S. In 1973, he was a member of

sons.

Williamson said he “feels deeply the
values this University represents” as ex-
pressed in its effort to “develop one’s
sense of responsibility as a citizen and
as a person.” He added: “I feel that it
has a unique place in the field ot educa-
tion nationally and that it deserves and,
in fact, must have a broader base of
support to assure its continued growth

 

 

in quality and excellence.”

Chapter news

ATLANTA. The Atlanta chapter has
indeed had a busy year. The Board of
Directors started the season with a meet-
ing last Aug. 15, resulting in the follow-
ing elections: Nathan V. Hendricks III,
president; Fleming Keefe, vice president;
William Tyler, secretary, and John W.
Hines, treasurer. The board was expand-
ed to include 16 members, and a program
of quarterly luncheon meetings was es-
tablished. Retiring president J. D. Hum-
phries was applauded for a job well
done.

In late August, the initial social activ-
ity of the chapter began at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. Nathan V. Hendricks. In-
coming freshmen and their parents were
treated to light refreshments and heavy
discussion about what they could expect
for the next four years. The chapter
looks forward to welcoming these fresh-
men into the ranks of Atlanta alumni.

The first quarterly board meeting was
held at the Piedmont Driving Club on
Oct. 24. In addition to planning the
year’s activities, the board was proud to
announce that Dave Eubank, a sopho-
more from New York, was the first win-
ner of the Atlanta Lacrosse ‘Trophy.
This trophy will be awarded each year
to the W&L lacrosse player who has
shown the most improvement.

On a rainy night in mid-November,
the chapter met at the Lovett School
auditorium to greet Drs. Edward C.
Atwood, John DeVogt, and Todd Lowry
and had the opportunity to question
them about the present state of the
economy. The only point of agreement
was that we should burn our class notes
and toss a coin as to future economic
projections. Before the discussion, the
visiting professors and their wives were
treated to cocktails and dinner at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Hendricks. At-
lanta alumni wish to thank Drs. Atwood,
Lowry, and DeVogt for a pleasant and
informative evening.

It was a great day for an outing when W&L and UVa. alumni battled to a 6-6 tie in

their 11th annual bowl game in Atlanta.

Washington and Lee and Virginia alum-
ni converged on Powers Ferry Polo
Field for the 11th Annual W&L-Virginia
Football Bowl. A tough battle ensued,
and despite overtime efforts, the game
ended a 6-6 tie. Plenty of beer, sun-
shine, and a lively combo contributed to
making this the most successful outing
in recent history.

On Feb. 6, the board held its quar-
terly meeting at the Atlanta City Club.
Fleming Keefe reported on his visit to
Lexington to attend the W&L Special
Alumni Conference on Nov. 14-16; also
general business matters were discussed.

The highlight of the social season was
a cocktail party on April 3 at the Pied-

indeed happy to welcome these digni-
taries who were in town to attend the
finance committee meeting of the Board
of ‘Trustees. A frank and relatively pain-
less (for the time being) discussion of
finances of the University and generous
cocktails were enjoyed by all.

In summary, it has been another ban-
ner year for the Atlanta alumni. Close
ties with the University, financial par-
ticipation by nearly one-third of local
alumni, and excellent leadership have
added to this year’s success. We are look-
ing forward to a spring gathering soon
and hope that next year will bring an
even more active calendar.

CHICAGO. An enthusiastic group of
alumni joined for cocktails and dinner
on March 13 at the Chicago Bar As-
sociation. President Huntley was the
guest of honor. In his remarks, he traced
the history of Washington and Lee as a
private institution, stressed the impor-
tance of the Alumni Association and of
high performance by individual alumni
chapters to the strength of the Univer-
sity. He praised the positive response of
alumni in the Chicago area and encour-
aged them to support their alumni chap-
ter on behalf of Washington and Lee.
Arrangements for the meeting were made
by Stanley A. Walton III, ’62A, ’65L,
who was recently elected president of the
chapter. Walton spoke briefly on some of
the chapter’s plans for the future and
recognized members of the chapter’s exe-
cutive committee. Alumni Secretary Bill
Washburn also attended the meeting.

TIDEWATER. The Tidewater chapter
held its second annual oyster roast on
March 22 at the Bayville Farms in Vir-
ginia Beach. Unlike the previous year,

April 1975

  
 
 
 
 
  
 

At the meeting in
Chicago were Paul K.

The Fund, now slightly more than

| a ‘year old, has received gifts ranging in
size from $5,000 to $63,000 (a substantial
trust estate of which Washington and
Lee is a beneficiary is also being invest-
ed as part of the Fund). The importance

of such gifts to the University cannot be

| overstated.

Some of these funds will be unre-

‘stricted additions to endowment. Some
will be used for purposes specified by

the donor, such as scholarships or the

| establishment of a lecture series. The
knowledge that this new capital will some

day be available enables the University

to plan more confidently and more flex-

and in which the ‘University has an im-
portant role to play.

Donors who participate in the Pool-

income produced by their capital. They
