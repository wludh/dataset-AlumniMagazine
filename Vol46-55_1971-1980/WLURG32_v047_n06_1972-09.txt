On the cover: The drawing of Washington Hall
bespeaks the charm and lasting beauty of the Wash-
ington and Lee Front Campus, which has now
joined Lee Chapel in being designated a National
Historic Landmark. The drawing, one of a group
of campus scenes, was executed by Marion Junkin
in 1927, the year he was graduated from Washing-
ton and Lee, and is used here through his courtesy.
The group of drawings was published in 1933 in
the form of a calendar distributed by the Univer-
sity. Dr. Junkin has been professor of art at W&L
since 1949.

The campus of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has been declared a National Historic Land-
mark by the U.S. Department of Interior.
Washington and Lee is only the third campus
in the nation to receive this designation, the
highest that can be conferred on a private site
by the federal government.

The citation said in part: “Washington and
Lee University . . . is composed of architecturally
harmonious and spatially related neoclassical
buildings that together form one of the most
dignified and beautiful college campuses in the
nation.

“The central and most significant element of
the complex, the Colonnade, along with the
flanking faculty residences, gives the impression
of being the product of a single architectural
concept. But in reality this splendid succession
of columned and pilastered buildings is an
evolutionary product of a building program
extending over nearly 150 years. While the mod-
ern University plant exceeds well the historic
core, the antebellum buildings have remained
the visual symbol and psychological heart of this
venerable institution.

“Even though the individual buildings that
make up Washington and Lee have gone through
extensive changes in the course of their growth
and development, the integrity of the University
complex as a whole has survived. It is a special
part of America’s heritage judged by the Secre-
tary of the Interior to possess significance for all
Americans and to be worthy of a place on the
Department of Interior’s roll of landmarks com-
memorating the nation’s past.”

John M. Stemmons, chairman of the Wash-
ington and Lee Achievement Council, announc-
ed the designation in Richmond on June 2 at a
dinner honoring Frances and Sydney Lewis, who

recently gave the University $9 million. The
Achievement Council, composed of ‘Trustees
and several vice chairmen, is providing the
leadership for the first phase of the University’s
$56-million, decade-long Development Program.
The program includes $1.1 million for the
restoration and preservation of the historic Front
Campus area.

The Front Campus is the second part of Wash-
ington and Lee to be declared a National His-
toric Landmark. Lee Chapel, built by Gen. Lee
and the burial place of him and his family was
so designated in 1961.

The major elements included in the Historic
Landmark designation are:

Washington Hall, built in 1824 by the noted
architect Colonel John Jordan, primarily of
brick made from earth on the campus itself.

Payne and Robinson Halls, flanking Washing-
ton Hall, built in 1831 and 1842 respectively,
in the same modified Greek Revival architectural
style as Washington Hall.

Four faculty homes, two at each end of the
campus, constructed in 1842, one of which is
the famous Lee-Jackson House.

Newcomb Hall, home of the School of Com-
merce, Economics and Politics, completed in
1882 and scheduled for renovation in the De-
velopment Program.

Tucker Hall, which currently houses the
School of Law, constructed in 1936 to replace an
earlier law building that burned in 1934.

The President’s House, built in 1867 under
General Lee’s supervision as his postwar home
and the home of every Washington and Lee
president since then.

The designation will be commemorated later
with the official presentation of a National His-
toric Landmark marker.

 

 

September, 1972

by Rupert N. Latture

Old George, campus sentinel,

has seen a lot of history

Why is the Washington and Lee campus
worthy of being a National Historic
Landmark? Rupert N. Latture, professor
of politics emeritus and an adviser to
President Huntley, gives many of the
answers in the following article—with the
help of the eyes of Old George.

Recently the occupants of Washington
Hall were startled by a strange noise
seemingly coming from the top of the
building. Old George had just heard ex-
citing news and was trying to dance a jig.
At that moment, March 16, 1972, the an-
nouncement had been made of a gift of
$9 million by Frances and Sydney Lewis
to build a magnificent new law school
complex on the Washington and Lee
campus. This thrilling piece of news was
enough to justify Old George’s attempt
to kick up his heels.

The announcement that affected Old
George so deeply leads us to recall some
of the interesting happenings occurring
within the range of vision of this sentinel
of the University grounds.

The statue of Old George is a splendid
example of folk art, embodying the like-
ness of the Father of our Country, who
was the first substantial benefactor of
Liberty Hall Academy. The statue was
carved from a large pine log by Capt.
Matthew Kahle, a Lexington cabinet-
maker, in 1842. The figure is eight feet
tall and depicts Washington wearing a
Roman toga.

One of the
shows Old George in a sad state of re-

accompanying pictures

pair. For more than a century numer-
ous coats of paint protected the statue
from the elements. Recently, however,
insects have bored into the old pine, thus
attracting woodpeckers to dig unsightly
holes in their search for tasty morsels.

a

Scientific treatment has been applied in
an effort to halt further depredation and
deterioration.

For many years it was customary for
members of the freshman class to prove
their mettle by climbing up to the cupola
to paint Old George green, red, or some
garish color. This bold act constituted a
challenge to members of the sophomore
class who felt obligated to protect the
gleaming white figure from any form of
desecration, particularly by freshmen.
Sometimes dangerous struggles between
representatives of the rival classes took
place in the limited area around the cup-
ola within sight of uneasy spectators. But
now the approach to the roof and cupola
is firmly closed against venturesome
pranksters.

The college bell is housed in the tower
which supports the statue. It has sum-
moned students to classes for more than a
hundred years and still performs that
function faithfully. In former years, fresh-
men had the privilege of ringing the bell
after football victories thus giving Old
George a thorough shaking. That practice
was discontinued when the old rope was
replaced by an electrically operated de-
vice that rings the bell automatically.

What emotions Old George must have
experienced in peeking at Maj. Thomas
J. Jackson as he strolled among the cam-
pus trees, hand in hand with Eleanor
Junkin, the fair daughter of Dr. George
Junkin, president of Washington College!
After Maj. Jackson and Miss Junkin were
married, Old George continued to observe
Prof. Jackson pass back and forth from
the Virginia Military Institute to the
home of his father-in-law, where he lived
for a time. This residence was later oc-
cupied by Jackson’s revered chief, Gen.
Robert E. Lee, when he later came in

 

 

1865 to serve as president of Washington
College.

In April, 1861, after two months of de-
bate, the Virginia State Convention voted
to secede from the Union. Washington
College students promptly raised the
“Southern flag’ on a pole which they at-
tached firmly to the statue of Old George
—whereupon President Junkin asked the
students to take the flag down. The stu-
dents did not act. President Junkin then
convened the faculty and asked those gen-
tlemen to order the students to bring the
flag down. The faculty did not comply
with the request, and a few days later the
distraught Dr. Junkin, with part of his
family and some of his personal belong-
ings, mounted a carriage and drove speed-
ily into Pennsylvania, where he remain-
ed until his death. Several years later Old
George looked on when Dr. Junkin’s re-
mains were brought to Lexington for
burial a few yards from the grave and
monument of his illustrious son-in-law,
Stonewall Jackson.

In June 1861, a body of Washington
College students began military drill un-
der the puzzled gaze of Old George. ‘They
were the Liberty Hall Volunteers. These
spirited young men were trained briefly,
equipped, uniformed, and sent down the
Valley to serve as a bodyguard for Gen.
Stonewall Jackson. The Volunteers fought
as a unit “from Manassas to Appomat-
tox.” They participated in numerous
battles and were cited a number of times
for their bravery in combat. Many of
them sacrificed their lives in the service
of Virginia and the Confederacy.

On May 15, 1863, Old George was
deeply saddened to see the Corps of Vir-
ginia Military Institute cadets escorting
the body of the beloved Stonewall Jack-
son back to his home town for burial, fol-

lowing his death from wounds received
in the Battle of Chancellorsville. This es-
centric professor had ridden into lasting
fame as a brilliant tactician for his swift
and surprising movements of troops in
the Valley Campaign and recognition as
one of Lee’s greatest lieutenants.

A story of truly epic quality is associ-
ated in a very special way with Old
George, showing why he is regarded as a
sort of charismatic symbol guarding the
University community. Ki Williams, Class
of 1915, relates that one day during his
senior year he met Dr. Harry Campbell,
dean of the University, in front of Lee
Chapel. When asked what he was looking
at so intently, Ki replied that he was
just admiring the pleasing appearance of
the white pillars and pilasters gleaming
in the bright sunlight. Dr. Campbell
then told him this story! At the time of
Hunter’s Raid on Lexington in June
1864, Henry A. duPont, a young captain
of artillery, was directed to demolish the
Virginia Military Institute and Washing-
ton College. The guns were turned
against the Institute, and the buildings
were promptly destroyed and several re-
sidences were set on fire. The artillery de-
tail then moved in the direction of Wash-
ington College. At this point Dr. Camp-
bell’s father, Prof. John Lyle Campbell,
arrived and called Captain duPont’s at-
tention to the statue of George Washing-
ton standing in a stately pose on top of
the principal building of the Colonnade.
This thoughtful and sensitive officer took
a good look at the white-columned build-
ings resting on the crest of the ridge. He
shook his head and declared that he
could not bring himself to fire on a
building which supported the life-like
statue of the Father of our Country, par-
ticularly since the building had no mili-

Ws

tary importance. It is interesting to note
that among the uninvited visitors to the
campus that day were two future Presi-
dents of the United States, Col. Ruther-
ford B. Hayes and Lt. William McKin-
ley. Books, laboratory equipment, and a
valuable store of minerals were carried
away, but the landmark buildings were
spared. A bronze plaque in Washington
Hall memorializes Capt. duPont’s service
to Washington and Lee University. It
would strengthen the credibility of this
tradition if it had been mentioned in
the memoirs of Capt. duPont (later
United States Senator from Delaware).
One quiet September afternoon in
1865, Old George caught a glimpse of
Traveller walking slowly into Lexing-
ton, bringing his famous master who was
to begin five years of matchless leadership
as president of Washington College. A
tender and trustful companionship be-
tween Gen. Lee and his noble iron gray
mount had developed during their three
war years together and was observed re-
peatedly by Old George as they left the
campus in the late afternoons in search
of solace along the scenic roads of Rock-
bridge County. Several weeks after Gen.
Lee arrived, Mrs. Lee and members of
her family came from Richmond by can-
alboat to live in what has become known
as the ‘‘Lee-Jackson house.” I'wo years
later Old George kept his eye on the
workmen who were engaged in the con-
struction of a chapel under the personal
supervision of Lee himself. The chapel
occupied a place deep in Lee’s heart be-
cause it reflected his own earnest Chris-
tian faith and his concern for the spirit-
ual life of his students. He was a regular
attendant at chapel services, and he main-
tained his office on the ground floor of

the building. By casting his eyes south-

This was Old George’s view after the Civil War.

The birds sometimes pester him.

building of the residence which was to be

and by every president since.

ington College, and a host of grief-strick-
en mourners joined in the procession
which moved through the streets of Lex-
ington, to V.M.I. and back to the chapel.
The remains of the South’s incomparable
leader lay buried in the basement of the
chapel for 13 years awaiting the erection
of the mausoleum where now rest Gen.
Lee, his father, Gen. “Light Horse Harry”
Lee, and other members of the Lee
family.

In 1875, the beautiful Valentine statue
was completed in Richmond and brought

looked on as almost the entire body of
Washington and Lee students provided
the power to pull the wagon bearing the
heavy marble statue from Alexander’s
Landing to the campus where it was
stored. Eight years later when the mau-
soleum was completed the statue was put
in place with an appropriate unveiling
ceremony in the presence of many distin-
guished guests.

In the spring of 1908, Old George saw
two strangers arrive on the campus, hav-
ing driven by carriage from Hot Springs
to see Valentine’s recumbent statue of
Lee and to see what Washington and Lee

and in the background the recumbent

bending an ear to hear the enchanting
language of this renowned orator.

In the summer of 1961, Old George
was almost unnerved as he watched the
roof of Lee Chapel come tumbling down.
Workmen were busy removing the slate
shingles so they could be returned to
position after the installation of steel
rafters. Cement floors replaced the well
seasoned pine boards, and other fireproof
materials were introduced into the struc-
ture. Some of the old timbers had begun
to sag, and the fire hazards were alarming.
A thorough restoration was required to
guard the Chapel against deterioration
and possible loss. Funds for this timely
and significantly rehabilitation were pro-
vided through the generosity of the Ford
Motor Company Fund. The Fund’s pur-
pose was to preserve a unique and treas-
ured landmark as a source of inspiration
to a stream of pilgrims who visit the
shrine year after year.

In May 1970, a wave of hysteria swept
over college campuses throughout the
country when United States troops enter-
ed Cambodia. A large number of Wash-
ington and Lee students gathered in
front of Lee Chapel right under the be-
wildered gaze of Old George to protest
the expansion of the war in Indochina.
Student spokesmen made some _ hastily
conceived demands, such as the discon-
tinuance of classes. President Huntley
spoke to the excited students, and so did
some responsible student leaders. Within
a few hours calm prevailed, and the entire
episode passed without any violence or
disruption of classes.

Old George is visibly moved by the re-
spectful gesture of the neatly uniformed
V.M.I. cadets as many of them salute

they pass in front of the Chapel on their
way to and from town. The friendly ex-
change of greetings among Washington
and Lee students is a source of pride to
Old George, too.

Soon Old George will be confronted
with a problem. During all these years
his face has been turned to the southeast.
Now, how can he see what is going on at
his back? A thoroughly modern library

is to be erected just behind Washington
Hall, almost at Old George’s heels. ‘The
impressive Lewis Hall and housing units
for married and unmarried students will
be built across Woods Creek. New roads,
bridges, and extensive landscaping will be
of exciting interest.

Surely a way will be found to enable
the venerable Old George to continue his
responsible oversight of the enlarged
campus as it expands westward.

Approximately 500 persons gathered
at Richmond’s John Marshall Hotel
on June 2 in tribute to Frances and
Sydney Lewis, who last March gave
Washington and Lee $9 million in
support of the School of Law’s portion
of the University’s $56-million De-
velopment Program.

The testimonial dinner, which
coincided with the spring meeting of
the Board of Trustees, was preceded
by a reception given by Dr. and Mrs.
John Newton Thomas and U.S.
Supreme Court Justice and Mrs.
Lewis F. Powell Jr. Dr. Thomas,
rector of the Board of ‘Trustees,
presided at the dinner. Justice Powell

 

and Lewis are also ‘Trustees.

The occasion brought together
many persons prominent in the fields
of law, business, politics, and educa-
tion. Among the guests were mem-
bers of Virginia’s Congressional
delegation, representatives of the
State Supreme Court and of other
state courts of record, members of
the State Legislature, commonwealth
officials, and numerous heads of
Virginia’s business, industrial, and
banking establishments. Presidents
of seven of the 12 colleges which are
members of the Virginia Foundation
for Independent Colleges were
present together with many of the
Foundation’s trustees.

Also attending were the persons
who, along with the Trustees, are

 

 

performing important volunteer work
for Washington and Lee, including
members of the Achievement Coun-
cil, the Alumni Board of Directors,
Parents’ Council, the Estate Planning
Council, and the Robert E. Lee
Associates.

Prominent among the guests was
John W. Warner, a Trustee, who was
recently appointed Secretary of the
Navy. He had returned just the day
before from Moscow, where he had
gone to sign a naval treaty with
Russia, one of the accords reached
during President Nixon’s visit to
the U.S.S.R.

A highlight of the evening was the
announcement by John M. Stemmons
that the Washington and Lee campus
has been designated a National
Historic Landmark. Stemmons is
chairman of the Achievement Coun-

cil, the group of Trustees, other
alumni, parents, and friends which
has assumed the responsibility of
raising $36 million for Washington
and Lee by 1976—the first phase of
the Development Program. ‘The Lewis
gift forms a part of that undertaking.
The funds will provide a new law
school building to be named Lewis
Hall and the initial endowment for
a new research center to be named
the Frances Lewis Law Center.
Informal remarks were also made

to the gathering by University Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley and
Ross Malone, the ‘Trustee who is
chairman of the Law School Com-
mittee of the Achievement Council.
Malone, vice president and general
counsel of General Motors Corp.,
reviewed the heritage of the School
of Law and closed with this tribute
to the school and to the Lewises:
“Every alumnus of Washington

of the Law School, its alumni, the
high quality of its faculty and of its
student bodies past and_ present.

on the part of its alumni which is
equalled by few if any educational
institutions in the country.

“The magnificient gift of Sydney
and Frances Lewis, which this
occasion commemorates, is inspiring
evidence of that loyalty and affection
on the part of one alumnus and his
wife. I am sure that they would be
the first to tell you that this same
bond extends throughout the Wash-
ington and Lee family, and I am
equally sure that the response of our
alumni to the Development Program
of the University will further confirm
the existence and the strength of
that bond.

this vision we have for Washington
and Lee is important not only for

us, but for the myriad institutions
which, like Washington and Lee, are
dedicated to the proposition that we
must maintain a strong independent
sector in the educational world, in
Virginia and in the nation. We must
do this if we are to have the much
bragged about diversity which we
claim for higher education in
America and if we are to expand
that diversity in the multitude of
ways which the complexity of our

September, 1972

 

civilization now surely requires.
“Washington and Lee will do its
part. We will make our own decisions
and set our own goals. We expect
to follow no one else in copying
what they do. We expect no one else
to follow us in copying what we do.
We expect each institution of strength
to stand on its own feet. We are
going to do that and with your help
we are going to do it well.”
Entertainment was provided by the
Washington and Lee Glee Club,
whose members remained beyond
the end of the academic year to
perform at the event. The group
presented essentially the same concert
it performed for Pablo Casals, at his
request, when the singers were in
Puerto Rico in April.

Mrs. Gaines? She’s fine!

What McDonald hath wrought

You have probably been wondering
how Mrs. Francis P. Gaines is getting
along. She is fine, thank you.

Since the death of her husband, the
late, great president of Washington and
Lee University, she has continued to live
at 1 Estill Street in Lexington. She stiil
entertains at occasional dinner parties, re-
minding her guests of the years during
which she served as the gracious hostess
in the President’s House. Naturally she is
frequently a guest at University functions.

Dr. and Mrs. Gaines came to Lexing-
ton in 1930 from Wake Forest College
where he had been president for three
years. After 29 years of outstanding suc-
cess as president of Washington and Lee,
Dr. Gaines retired in 1959. He and Mrs.
Gaines built an attractive and comfort-
able house in Davidson Park. On Decem-
ber 31, 1963, Dr. Gaines suffered a heart
attack and died instantly.

True to family tradition, the three
Gaines sons, are engaged in education.
Dr. Pendleton Gaines, formerly _ presi-
dent of Wofford College, is dean of con-
tinuing education at the University of Ari-
zona. He directs the activities of the many
branches of the university outside of
Tucson. Robert Gaines has been coordi-
nator of the public schools in Ayer Coun-
ty, Mass. Dr. Edwin Gaines is associate
dean of the University of Arizona. This
fall he will be on leave to serve as visiting
professor of history at the University of
East Anglia, Norwich, England.

Mrs. Gaines has three brothers. Dr.
Pierre Robert is a prominent pediatrician
in Beaumont, Tex. Associated with him
in the practice of medicine is his son, Dr.
Pierre Robert Jr., who graduated from
Washington and Lee in 1951.

Dr. Joseph Robert was formerly presi-
dent of Hampden-Sydney College and is

Cavett Robert

 

now professor of history at the University
of Richmond.

Cavett Robert, a 1932 graduate of the
W&L School of Law, lives in Phoenix,
Ariz., and travels from one end of the
country to the other making inspirational
addresses to clubs, institutions, and busi-
ness organizations.

Cavett Robert was recently named
‘‘Arizona’s Ambassador of Good Will” by
Gov. Jack Williams in recognition of his
service in carrying the message of the
good life in Arizona to audiences through-
out the nation. He was presented a cita-
tion and an Arizona flag to be displayed
on the podiums of the many cities where
he appears.

Robert was also the recipient recently
of the 1972 Golden Gavel Award of
Toastmasters International. The award,
the highest in the organization, is pre-
sented as a tribute to persons who have
distinguished themselves in the field of
communication and leadership. His on-
stage style has been described as a “mind-

WeL

ES

boggling mixture of Billy Graham, Will
Rogers, and Rhett Butler.”

He is the author of Human Engineer-
ing and Motivation and has been a lawyer
in New York, a utility executive, and di-
rector of one of the nation’s largest sales
organizations. On July 19, he was the
keynote speaker at the Southern Indus-
trial Relations Conference in Atlanta.

 

McDonald’s Mature Oak

The acorn which Walter McDonald of

 

Cincinnati planted 40 years ago has
grown into a sturdy oak. McDonald, a
Trustee of Washington and Lee from
1945 to 1961, was largely responsible for
the establishment at the University of the
class agent system, a program that over
the years has produced an ever-increas-
ing amount of alumni gifts for the Uni-
versity.

This past year, for instance, nearly 100
class agents volunteered their services,
and they and their classmates produced
$372,000 in unrestricted gifts in support
of the University’s educational and gen-
eral budget. The amount exceeded the
Alumni Fund goal for 1971-72 by ap-
proximately $12,000.

(A full report on the Alumni Fund
and other gifts to Washington and Lee
will be carried in a later issue of this
magazine.)

This performance and the fact that in
the decade of the ’70’s the University will
require nearly $8 million in annual giv-
ing if it is to meet the overall goals of its
$56-million Development Program em-
phasize the significance of McDonald’s
farsighted and dedicated service to Wash-
ington and Lee.

In 1931, McDonald, a 1910 graduate
of the School of Law, was elected presi-

September, 1972

dent of the Alumni Board of Directors.
The Great Depression was on, and the
finances of the University were at a low
ebb. The Alumni Association was equally
short of funds. McDonald and Cy Young,
then alumni secretary, recognized the ur-
gent need for alumni support for all
phases of University activity. They de-
cided to do something about it.

McDonald
and Young determined upon a plan and

After long consideration,

procedure for appealing to alumni for as-
sistance on an annual basis. They were
aware that the class agent system had
been successful at other colleges and de-
cided to introduce the program at Wash-
ington and Lee.

McDonald put his heart into the work
and a considerable sum of his money. He
paid Young’s expenses to visit alumni in
a dozen cities to stimulate their interest
in helping Washington and Lee. More-
over, McDonald brought to the campus
at his own expense a competent consul-

Walter McDonald, benefactor of W&L.

tant John Darnall, who spent a _ year
setting up the class agent program, a sys-
tem under which a member of a class as-
sumes the responsibility for soliciting
annual gifts from his classmates.

McDonald’s concern and vision were
soundly based. For under Cy Young and
later under the able leadership of Alumni
Secretary Bill Washburn the history of
the Alumni Fund has been one of grow-
ing success. In 1933, there were 505 con-
tributors giving $3,700. Ten years later,
1,409 alumni gave $12,300. In 1953, the
number of contributors had risen to 2,317
and the amount to $48,800. By 1963, the
figures were up to 3,905 donors and
$140,800 in gifts. Now, 10 years later, the
Alumni Fund has approached the $400,-
000 mark.

Special thanks are due to McDonald,
the hundreds of class agents and the
thousands of their classmates who have
made the class agent program work for
Washington and Lee.
