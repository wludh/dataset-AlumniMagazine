A letter from Northern Ireland:
‘The barriers are built into society’

March,

1972

 

Dr. William Buchanan, professor of politics at WL
and head of the department, is on a year’s leave of ab-
sence, attending Queens University in Belfast and doing
research on the parliament of Northern Ireland. The
editors of W&L are grateful to him for this personal view
of the “troubles” that are tormenting Northern Ireland.

I’m responding with enthusiasm to your suggestion
that I submit to the alumni magazine something “‘per-
sonal” rather than “scholarly” on our experiences here,
because I find it hard to be the detached, dispassionate
observer. ‘The role of a visiting scholar in this situation
is not always a happy one—rather like the guest who ar-
rives just as the phone rings, the bathtub overflows and
the roast burns. I occasionally encounter someone who
says, “How kind of an American to come over and
straighten out our affairs for us.’’ But the vast majority
are genuinely eager to help a foreigner who is vainly try-
ing to comprehend a very complex set of events. ‘he best
insight is given by the now famous comment of an anony-
mous Belfast citizen: “Anyone who isn’t confused here
doesn’t really understand what’s going on.”

Remember last spring our jokes about how I might
become Jewish for the year to avoid identifying with
either side? I came determined not only to be, but to
appear, uncommitted. It’s fruitless. Everybody plays a
game in which he tries to determine the faith of a new
acquaintance, but one of the rules is that it’s not polite
to ask directly. One’s name and its spelling, one’s neigh-
borhood, one’s occupation are all grounds for a-guess. As
a final resort you try to find what school he or his chil-
dren attended, but this is so definite a clue that in effect
it’s an admission that the game is lost. Of course, these
clues won’t work with an American. (One comment was:
“Washington and Lee—how ecumenical.”) ‘This doesn’t
deter them from making up their minds. I should have
felt a moment of triumph when a prominent Protestant
politician introduced me to a Catholic one with the re-
mark, “Professor Buchanan is a co-religionist of yours.”
I should have been triumphant, but such is the pervasive-

 

Dr. William Buchanan is pictured here in the country side near
Lexington—a setting far more peaceful than the one he has
been experiencing for the past six months in Northern Ireland.

A Letter from Northern Ireland

 

 

 

Wide World

In Belfast, grim-faced policemen carry the coffin of a constable who was killed by terrorist machine gun bullets during an ambush in

Londonderry. Such scenes are now common in Belfast.

ness of the necessity of placing everyone that I heard
myself, much to my disgust, saying, “No, I’m not really

.er... uh.”

Perhaps the most basic difference in the approach of
an American is the naive expectation, or at least hope,
that some “solution” or accommodation can be discover-
ed. The European, and particularly the Irish, view of
politics is that it is at best a messy and unpromising affair
to whose defects the sensible observer must become re-
signed. Empirically this view is sounder, but there are
virtues in naivete. As I look to the years ahead and the
comparable problems that face us, black and white,
North and South, I believe that hoping for accommoda-
tion is a better strategy than resignation.

Of course, if I had been raised in Belfast I’d look at
it differently. There was a period, roughly between 1800

2

and 1839, when relations between Protestants and Catho-
lics were good, and Anglicans contributed to the build-
ing of churches for the Catholics trickling in from the
country. Then the city went into a population boom due
to the linen and shipbuilding industries. Many of the
row houses you see on TV were built between 1830 and
1900 to accommodate this population. ‘They still do—not
very comfortably. Two rooms downstairs, three up; two
windows front, two back; a cold water faucet in the
kitchen and a toilet facing on the tiny rear patio that
holds the garbage can. Nearly half the families have no
more amenities than this. Though clean and well kept,
they don’t provide much room for children to play or
adolescents to exercise. The Catholics settled around
their first churches and in the streets leading off the main
road from the West that brought them into the city. That

“Then it occurred to me that this
middle-class haven of security
was safe only relatively.”

few minutes on the main arteries. We seldom see soldiers
on foot patrol in our neighborhood, though one day last
month they surrounded an apartment house across the
alley for several hours—we never knew why.

Of course it is far different in the troubled areas,
where searches and arrests occur during the night, with
women banging garbage can lids to warn the IRA that
troops are in the vicinity, with stones flying during the
day and tear gas seeping into the house, with snipers and
troops firing at one another, and children underfoot even
at the grimmest moments. (You can’t keep them in all the
time, their mothers say.) Perhaps the most poignant story
is about the car, found parked repeatedly on a country
road in the middle of the night. The police became su-
spicious and surrounded it with spotlights and guns at
ready. Inside was an elderly couple. It wasn’t as com-
fortable as their bed, they explained, but at least you
could get a quiet night’s sleep.

If there is a point to this, it’s that a community can
survive tremendous disruption when there seems to be
nothing you can do about it—personally, that is. Shops
are boarded up after the bombings, workers show up in
the morning haggard and sleepy, funerals proceed up the
street, people stay in at night and watch TV. The IRA is
making the same miscalculation that the U.S. Air Force
has made on several occasions—overestimating the effect
on society of high explosives.

If this were a scholarly article ’d have to provide a
conclusion. Of course there isn’t any conclusion. ‘here
was once a time when Americans looked on such circum-
stances as being remote in time and place—the sort of
situation that English speaking people were now sensible
enough not to get themselves into. But I’m impressed
with how little there is in the Ulster situation that
couldn’t potentially be translated into American terms.
What is particularly distressing is that both sets of people
who are doing these abominable things to one another
are individually most hospitable, friendly, courteous,
sympathetic people—not just in their encounters with
visiting Americans but in their individual relations with
one another, even across the religious divide. ‘he worst
occurs only when each group gets together behind its
barriers—but the barriers are hard to surmount for they
are built into the society.

John J. Crittenden:
He almost made it

In searching the records for Washington and Lee
men who have served as Justices of the U.S. Supreme
Court, it was found that John J. Crittenden, who at-
tended Washington Academy 1802-04, was nominated
by John Quincy Adams to be an Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court, but was not confirmed by the Senate.
Crittenden was nominated to fill the vacancy created by
the death of Justice Robert ‘Trimble, who died on
August 25, 1828. Remembering his father’s experience
with nominations, President Adams did not make a recess
appointment. In the meantime President Adams and
General Andrew Jackson had waged a bitter campaign
for the presidency, with Jackson emerging as the winner.

On December 17, 1828, President Adams sent a mes-
sage to the Senate nominating Crittenden to fill the Court
vacancy. The nomination was referred to the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary that same day. However, no
report was made by the Committee until January 26,
1829, and even then the debates were kept secret for a
time. Senator Berrien (Georgia) for the Committee on
the Judiciary reported two resolutions, the main one
being “Resolved that it is not expedient to act upon the
nomination of John J. Crittenden as Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court of the United States during the pres-
ent session of Congress.”’

Excerpts taken from remarks made by Senator Holmes
(Maine) during the debate on February 2, 1829, gives a
fairly clear idea of the underlying reason for Senate in-
action. “‘Sir’’, he said, “let the advocates of this resolution
say what they will, and enforce this determination by
what arguments they can, and the public will and must
believe that this Mr. Crittenden is postponed and vir-
tually rejected for no other earthly reason than that he
was not in favor of General Jackson for President... .
Now if it is expedient to take from one administration
and give it to the next, why not meet the question at
once and reject? Why not say that John J. Crittenden
ought not to be a Justice of the Supreme Court because
he was opposed to the election of General Jackson? If
that is the reason, avow it, and the people will judge
whether it is a sound one”’.

John J. Crittenden was an extraordinary person. His
actions as a student at Washington Academy showed
early evidence of independence and boldness. Dr. Cren-

8

 

John J. Crittenden

shaw in his General Lee’s College tells of two instances
in which he was disciplined by the trustees, once for re-
fusing to testify in a faculty investigation of a report
that certain students were attempting to “fight or abet a
duel’, and the second for throwing a biscuit at the ste-
ward in the dining hall. As a consequence he transferred
to the College of William and Mary to complete his col-
lege studies.

Few men have rendered more varied services in gov-
ernment than John J. Crittenden. He served for several
years in the Kentucky legislature, in the state judiciary,
and in the governorship of his state. He served four un-
connected terms as Kentucky’s representative in the U.S.
Senate. He was Attorney General of the United States
under three Presidents: Harrison, Tyler and Fillmore.
He strove mightily to bring reconciliation between North
and South on the issues of secession and slavery. His last
public office was a two-year term in the U.S. House of
Representatives. He was renowned for his eloquence, his
integrity and his patriotism.

It is regrettable that the faculty of Washington Aca-
demy did not perceive Crittenden’s irascibility as indica-
tive of the significant role he was to play in the drama
of American history.

President and Mrs. Huntley examine the Lee clock given to the University by
Mrs. Fred A. Fitzgerald.

March, 1972

     

S. G. C. Watkins, a dentist in Montclair,
N. J., from whom Fitzgerald acquired it.

The clock is inscribed “B. Chandlee
Nottingham”, indicating that it was made
by Benjamin Chandlee, Sr., a prominent
Quaker clockmaker who flourished in
Nottingham, Md., from 1714 until 1741.

Clocks made by members of the
Chandlee family are highly prized by per-
sons with antique grandfather clocks.
President Huntley said, ‘Washington and
Lee is most grateful to Mrs. Fitzgerald
for this significant gift. It is appropriate
that this particular clock find a resting
place in the last home of General Lee.
There it will be a constant reminder of
the hours President Lee spent in devoted
service to the rebuilding of Washington
College”’.

 

A Gift of Letters

A number of letters providing a unique-

 

ly colorful and detailed description of
the American soldier’s life in France and
Germany at the end of World War I have
been donated to Washington and Lee and
will be placed on permanent loan at the
George C. Marshall Research Library.

The letters were written between May
and December, 1918, by Capt. Lewis Cole-
man Gordon of St. Louis. Born in Salem,
Va., in 1887, Gordon was a student at
Washington and Lee from 1904 until
1907, and his father, Dr. Edward Clifford
Gordon, was treasurer, secretary and proc-
tor of the institution while Robert E. Lee
was its president following the Civil War.

The letters were donated to the Uni-
versity by Mrs. Alfred Taylor of Grosse
Point, Mich., Capt. Gordon’s niece. Mrs.
Taylor’s husband is a graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee.

The Gordon letters provide a valuable

I]

 

Campus News

 

documentation of the day-to-day activities
of the American soldier in the last months
of the war and immediately after the
Armistice during the first months of the
Allied ocupation in France. Most of the
letters are addressed to Capt. Gordon’s
mother, some to his father, and one to his
future wife.

One letter, written Dec. 26, 1918, in
Dungenheim, Germany, is remarkable for
a prediction it contains of World War II:
“It is difficult to eradicate the product of
of education and_ blood.
There is ample material for another Ger-

generations

man army over here. Unless a peace is
concluded that will effect a vital change
in German government, education, econ-
omy and philosophy for two or three gen-
erations, I fear that she will reach out
. “Tell
all my sisters-in-law and friends to raise

again for her place in the sun...

their boys to be soldiers. America may
need them some day.”

Capt. Gordon acted as his own censor,
occasionally writing of “the battle of ——.”
A multi-page letter written to his future
wife, in which he alludes to his intent to
propose marriage to her, has a small rec-
tangle cut neatly from every page, where
an inscription on the letterhead could
have given away his unit’s location.

Capt. Gordon arrived in France with
the 4th U.S. Engineers early in May,
1918. His unit arrived in Dungenheim,
where he was sta-

,

“Kingdom of Prussia,’
tioned during the Occupation, on Dec.
15, after a 260-kilometre march. A career
officer, he retired from the Army with the
rank of colonel in 1946. At the time he
was commanding officer of the Reserve
Officer Training Corps unit at the Michi-
gan School of Engineering. Col. Gordon
died in 1951.

In 1969 the Col. Lewis Coleman Gor-

12

don honor scholarship fund was created
at Washington and Lee through a bequest
from the estate of his widow, who died in
1967. ‘The Gordon Scholarship is held this
academic year by Bryan E. McNeill, a
sophomore from New Orleans and Dean’s
List scholar.

 

Leyburn Concert

 

Dr. James Graham Leyburn, pianist,
gave a entitled ‘Eighteenth
Century Composers and their 20th Cen-
tury Admirers” on Feb. 14 in the Lee
Chapel.

Dr. Leyburn, professor of sociology
and anthropology, is the former head of
the sociology department and was dean of
the University from 1947 until 1955.

His program included works of Ra-
meau, Scarlatti, Couperin, Haydn and

concert

Mozart, as well as the 20th century com-
posers Debussy, Paderewsky, Ravel, Hin-
demith and Prokofieff, whose works on
the program were inspired by and pay tri-
bute to their 18th century ancestors.

An accomplished concert pianist, Dr.
Leyburn is characterized by deep convic-
tion and a level of expertise matching
that of the great professional pianists.

As a sociologist, Dr. Leyburn taught at
Yale before coming to Washington and
Lee. He is the author of a number of
major sociological studies, among them
the classic Haitian People, recently re-pub-
lished by the Yale Press and winner of the
Anisfield-Wolf Award.

 

Student Efforts Rewarded

Student efforts at Washington and Lee
have been rewarded with a $20,000 grant

 

from a North Carolina foundation to be
used in offering scholarships to economi-

 

Dr, James G. Leyburn

cally disadvantaged students. The grant
from the Hillsdale Fund, Inc., of Greens-
boro was made as a result of a proposal
designed by the Student Recruitment
Committee at Washington and Lee, an
agency of the student government.

The $20,000 is to be awarded at the
rate of $5,000 a year for four years, ac-
cording to terms of the grant. The first
scholarships to qualified students will be
awarded in the 1972-73 year.

The Hillsdale Fund award will be ad-
ministered by the University Committee
on Student Financial Aid, as are all schol-
arship and loan funds. Student representa-
tives serve on that committee in matters
of policy, but not in the consideration of
individual applications.

The Hillsdale grant is the second to
be made to the University because of the
work of the student group, which was
formed in 1969 by Stephen W. Robinson,
now president of the student body. Cur-

of the Boys Club, died before graduating last December. He was awarded a degree

ed to membership on the board of trustees
of the preparatory school he attended in
Maine.

Dr. Phillips was voted to receive the
outstanding director award of Omicron
Delta Epsilon, the economics honor soc-
iety, the first time that the annual award
has been awarded to a director in the re-
gion which includes Virginia. The award
was made “‘in recognition of Prof. Phillips’
outstanding work to further the society’s
goals in the field of economic science and
to further knowledge in the profession.”

In addition, Dr. Phillips was one of
two new trustees to join the board of
Hebron (Me.) Academy this winter. Dr.
Phillips is a 1952 graduate of the 168-
year-old preparatory school.

A member of Washington and Lee’s
faculty since 1959, Dr. Phillips is the au-

14

thor of two texts in economics, including
the widely used Economics of Regulation
—Theory and Practice in the Transporta-
tion and Public Utility Industries, and
more than 30 scholarly articles. He has
served as a consultant to such firms as
the American Telephone and Telegraph
Co., the New York Stock Exchange, and
the Virginia Electric and Power Co., and
is active in public service as well, serving
currently as mayor of Lexington, chair-
man of the area planning district, and
president of the Lexington-Rockbridge
Boys’ Club.

 

Student Housing Center

 

In a new effort to put student ten-
ants in contact with landlords in Lexing-
ton and elsewhere in Rockbridge County,

the Student Center at the University has
begun an informational center on student
housing.

Landlords register property they wish
to rent. The housing center then provides
the information to students, who then
contact either the landlord directly, or the
landlord’s agent.

In the current year, more than one-half
of Washington and Lee’s 1,600 students
live in rooms, apartments, or houses off
campus. Of a total of 862 students living
off campus, the larger share, 578, live in
Lexington, and fewer than one-third, 284,
live in the county (or elsewhere outside
Lexington).

The 45 per cent who do not live in
private housing are either dormitory resi-
dents, live in fraternity houses, or com-
mute from their parents’ homes.

Only 521 private units—which includes
the entire range of houses, apartments,
and single rooms—are rented by students
in all geographical areas, according to re-
sults of a comprehensive housing survey
taken at the time of student registration
last autumn. Those 521 units accommo-
date all 862 off-campus students, the sur-
vey disclosed.

The survey also showed that students
pay monthly rentals ranging between $20
and $150 for apartments and from $45 to
$150 for entire houses—depending on the
accommodations provided.

The University is currently investigat-
ing whether it is financially feasible to
build new on-campus student housing in
the near future. President Robert E. R.
Huntley said in October the institution
hopes to construct new “apartment-type”
housing to accommodate approximately
200 upperclass students within the next
two or three years. He made the statement
in an address during Parents’ Weekend.

ally pledged, according to statistics pro-
vided by the Interfraternity Council. In
1970, almost the same proportion—65 per
cent—pledged.

Fifteen national fraternities maintain
chapters at the University. Sigma Phi Epsi-
lon, which in 1970 had assumed “lodge”
status and moved from its chapter house
on Preston Street, came back last fall as a
full member of the IFC. Undergraduate
SPE members hope to move back to their
house in the near future. Under an ar-
rangement between the University and
the fraternity alumni organization, owners
of the house, Washington and Lee has
maintained it as dormitory housing for
freshmen (last year) and upperclassmen
(this year), but that arrangement is sche-
duled to expire at the end of the 1972-73
academic year.

 

Fancy Dress Returns

 

Fancy Dress returned to the Washing-
ton and Lee campus this year with a
dance and concert by the rock group Sha-
Na-Na on Feb. 12 in Evans Dining Hall.
The floor was jammed for the event spon-
sored by the Dance Board, under the di-
rection of Fancy Dress President Brian
Greig of Austin, Tex.

Costume was either black tie or the
garb of the 1950’s appropriate to the
music played by Sha-Na-Na. And as it
turned out, slicked-back hair, white socks,
jeans and saddle shoes predominated. The
festivities began at 9 p.m. and continued
until 1 a.m. Sha-Na-Na appeared at W&L
last year in what was considered the fav-
orite concert of the season. The group
equalled that performance at Fancy Dress
this year.

The dance was preceded by a cocktail
party at the Buffalo Creek pavilion.

Washington and Lee.

Foltz succeeds Richard H. Turrell of
Short Hills, N.J., as head of the Lee As-
sociates. Turrell, secretary of the Fiduci-
ary Trust Co. of New York, remains as
president of the Washington and Lee
Alumni Association. He is a 1949 gradu-
ate of the University.

The Lee Associates, with almost 300
members, consists of Washington and
Lee’s most dedicated supporters. The or-
ganization holds a principal leadership

role in development and implementation
of policy at the University.

In addition to his duties as president
of Campbell Soups International, Foltz is
vice president of the Campbell Soup Co.,
the parent corporation, with offices in
Camden, N.J. He holds a number of
directorships in related industrial and
management groups.

Foltz is a member of the bars of Vir-
ginia, Georgia, Arkansas and Ohio, and
has been admitted to practice before the
United States Supreme Court. He is active
in the American Management Association,
serving as a member of its board of direc-
tors and as vice president of its World
Council. He is also a member of the board
of the Thunderbird Graduate School of
International Management. Mr. and Mrs.

Second Troub Play

John Osborne’s award-winning drama
Luther opened a five-day run at Wash-
ington and Lee on Feb. 16 as the second
production of the season by the Univer-
sity’s Troubadour Theatre.

 

Robert Carrere, a senior from New
Orleans, played the title role, and Gre-
gory P. Buch, a junior from Fremont,
Neb., played Hans Luther, the father. A
central theme in the drama is the conflict
between the two men, the senior Luther
unable to comprehend his son’s rejection
of worldly affairs. Lee Kahn, assistant pro-
fessor of drama and head of the Troub
Theatre, directed the play.

Luther, an intense human drama, won
the New York Critics’ Circle award as the
best play of the season in 1964. Its author
wrote Look Back in Anger and other
plays as well.

THE TOPIC:
Washington and Lee Today...
Its Plans... Its Future

Much about your University is changing. It now has
exciting plans for continued development. The
Special Alumni Conference to be held November

ences designed to give a relatively small group of
alumni a three-day, in-depth look at every facet of
Washington and Lee. The conference will feature
small-group discussions that bring all points of
interest into sharp focus.

Past conferences have been highly successful, enjoy-
able, and worthwhile. |

conference, please write to William C. Washburn,
