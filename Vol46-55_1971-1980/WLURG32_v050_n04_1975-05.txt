ON THE COVER: Lacrosse, Spring Reunions,
and the beauty of Rockbridge County make up
our cover theme. Washington and Lee had an-
other successful year in Lacrosse, upsetting No. |
Johns Hopkins to reach the NCAA semifinals
against Maryland, The huddle photo is by W.
Patrick Hinely, ’73. Three pages of reunion pic-
tures start on Page 10. And the camera also tells
a lot about why Rockbridge County is a good place
to live, beginning on Page 2. The cover reunion

their stuffy proprieties and horse-faced
wives, and could booze it up with the
little ladies of what was quaintly known
as the “demi-monde.” An illustrious pro-
totype of this behavior pattern was King
Edward VII, Queen Victoria’s son, whose
feeling of liberation may be reflected
admittedly in a much milder degree, in
the bosom of the Buena Vista housewife
shopping in the bazaars of Florence. The
feeling isn’t all illusion, but it is an il-
lusion to think that this same sense of
freedom will remain if you settle down
and became a member of a community,
which will soon impose upon you a new
set of compulsions and obligations, in-
cluding the income tax and emptying the
garbage. If you are unlucky, you can find
yourself in a community in England,
Germany, or Italy whose inhabitants are
so nosey, straight-laced and bigoted that
they will make the people of Fairfield
look like jaded Bohemians with the es-
thetic taste of Sir Kenneth Clark.

You may have noticed that I have
said nothing about language, and _ this
may be more important to some people
than it is to us, possibly because we
don’t communicate as much. All we have
is pigeon French, some humming-bird
German, and enough English to get a
hotel room and order a meal. Actually
English is the lingua franca of most de-
veloped parts of the world, and people
from English-speaking countries can be
found almost everywhere. Only once
have we been unable to communicate
with anyone in any language. That was
in Bulgaria, at a hotel at Rasanlak, in
the rose country, and I admit that it was
a slightly Kafka-esque experience, some-
thing like Bergman’s film, The Silence,
in which the hotel personnel talks in a
completely unrecognizable language. But
we got a room and were fed by going to
the kitchen and pointing to the food
we wanted.

In regard to climate, it’s a pity that
ever since the great ancient civilizations
of the Nile and Euphrates valleys, the

6

  

power centers of culture have been mov-
ing northward into worse and_ worse
weather. There have been books written
on the responsibility of the lousy English
climate for the glories of English litera-
ture, and on how endless cold and
gloomy winters are responsible for the
genius of Scandinavian countries and
Russia, not to mention their enormous
consumption of alcohol.

We soon also made the discouraging
discovery that all of the most pleasant
coast lines in warm climates have long
since become jam-packed with people,
which means, among other things, con-
gestion, floods of tourists, and paralyzing
prices. The French Riviera is as much of
a horror as Florida, and every Eden now
has a high-rise Hilton. The beaches of
Italy swarm with bambini. Hell, Jean-
Paul Sartre once wrote, is other people.
We have never been in Southern Calif-
ornia, but we have heard plenty about it

Below left: No, not this beauty
spot on the Dalmatian coast.

Above: No, not even these digs in the
Wissous suburb of Paris.

(I think too much), and when I try to
imagine what Hell might be like, I think
it must look something like Los Angeles.

We were once about to make a down-
payment on a lot on the Northern Neck
of Virginia. Since then, half of the lot has
washed into Chesapeake Bay and the re-
mainder is buried in a forest of ranch
houses. We also thought of Central
America and the Caribbean area, where
we spent some time when it was back-
ward, uncongested, colonial, and _pleas-
ant. All that has changed now. Even in
the old days the area was culturally bleak,
and the North American was inclined to
spend most of his time on the beach and
drinking whiskey, which may be the ideal
life for some people, but not for us.

More recently we thought seriously of
Yugoslavia, which is culturally interest-
ing, and we have made a number of
trips there with a home site in the backs
of our minds. As you know, the heavy-

Chapter news

RICHMOND. A large and enthusiastic
group of Washington and Lee alumni
and Hollins alumnae, together with their
husbands and wives and dates, turned out
for a reception and dinner on April 10
at the Country Club of Virginia. The
event was cosponsored by the alumni
and alumnae chapters of the two schools,
with Robert E. Payne, ’63, president of
the W&L chapter, and Mrs. George (No-
rene) Yowell of Hollins, making the prin-
cipal arrangements. Charles McDowell,
‘48, Washington correspondent and col-

 

 

 

  
 

May 1975

umnist for the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch, was the honored guest and speak-
er. He and his wife, Ann, were warmly
received. Spicing his talk with typical
McDowell humor, Charley shed light on
the Virginia political situation, a subject
with which he is uniquely familiar. A
cocktail hour preceded the dinner. The
table decorations were supplied by the
Hollins alumnae and were lovely. Payne
and Mrs. Yowell made introductory re-
marks, and Jack DeJarnette, ’65, intro-
duced McDowell. Sam Dudley, '58, past
