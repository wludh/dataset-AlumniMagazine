Non Incautus Futuri

ECORDED on the pages of

more than two centuries of
Washington and Lee history are
countless instances of significant
achievement: difficulties overcome,
challenges met, opportunities
grasped, men moulded in their for-
mative years to fill subsequent roles
of distinguished service to man-
kind. But even as we reflect with
justifiable pride on the heritage of
strength that is ours, we are not
unmindful of the future and our ob-
ligations to it.

We feel those obligations keenly.
We recognize new opportunities,
new goals that are all the more at-
tainable because the position from
which we advance is one of
strength. Moreover, we realize that
we must advance—that we must be
active, not passive, postive, not neg-
ative—if we are to assume in full
the responsibilities that the future
holds for us.

To this end the Board of Trus-
tees has been looking for several
years to the establishment of a new
administrative office charged with
the important responsibility of ad-
ministering a program of long-
range planning and fund-raising
for the University. That office be-
came a reality in September with
the arrival on the campus of Don-
ald EK. Smith, formerly secretary-
treasurer of the Worcester Poly-
technic Institute Alumni Associa-
tion, to assume the position of Di-
rector of University Development.

He set to work immediately, es-
tablishing his office, acquiring a
staff, acquainting himself with
Washington and Lee and its peo-
ple, and sketching in broad outline
the form the Development Program
eventually would take. As that out-
line has become more definite in the

2

intervening weeks, it has become
increasingly clear that intensive
work is required in each of three
broad areas. The first of these is
that of careful study aimed at es-
tablishing the University’s needs.
The second is concerned with pre-
senting and interpreting the Uni-
versity, its functions, and its needs
to Washington and Lee’s various
publics. The third is that of fund-
raising.

To give initial guidance and
impetus to work within each of
these areas, a Steering Committee
for University Development was
established. The committee’s first
decision was that the Development
Program should determine and if
possible satisfy not only the present
needs of the University, but also
those with which it will be faced
during the next ten years. This
position decided, seven additional
committees were formed to study
and to evaluate the relative im-
portance of all needs related to the
faculty, the students, the curricu-
lum, and the physical plant (land,
buildings, equipment, and the op-
eration and maintenance of each).
These committees are currently
hard at work.

To function within the second
area, the Steering Committee es-
tablished the Committee on Pub-
lications and Publicity. This group
is studying the University’s var-
ious publics and evaluating the
many ways in which those publics
are reached or influenced by the
University, its publications, per-
sonnel, and policy. And this group

is giving full attention to ways and
means of improving both the effec-
tiveness of our public relations pro-
gram and the total impression
Washington and Lee creates on its
various publics.

Looking to the eventual organi-
zation and operation of various
fund-raising programs, the Uni-
versity Board of Trustees and the
Steering Committee are now giving
thought to the establishment of a
University Development Council,
which will have the dual respon-
sibility of recommending fund-
raising policy and overseeing the
organization and operation of the
various fund-raising programs that
are inaugurated. This Council will
be the University’s counterpart to
the Alumni Association’s recently
established Alumni Fund Commit-
tee, which is charged with direct-
ing fund-raising efforts of the
Alumni Association. These two or-
ganizations will work in closest
cooperation to the common end that
the University be better served.

It would be impossible for me
to overestimate the importance of
this total development undertaking,
for on its success hinge many
things: the continuing welfare of
our University, the preservation of
cherished traditions, the fulfillment
of opportunities for greater service
and the attendant enhancement of
prestige, the growth to fuller sig-
nificance of the many values inher-
ent in our very independence. To
be successful we must rely gener-
ously upon the time, the interests,
and the energies of all segments of
the University family. If they rise
to the great challenges of the future
as they have to those of the past—
and I am confident they will—we
can look with assurance to a third
century of service that can only add
to our usefulness as one of this na-
tion’s leading independent institu-
tions of higher education.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

  

Buford Wilkinson

“Annual giving has assumed in
recent years the vital role of mak-
ing it possible for Washington and
Lee to maintain and improve its
standards of education.”

The foregoing is the stated con-
viction of President Francis P.
Gaines. In it the Alumni Board of
Trustees takes both encourage-
ment and a full measure of pride,
for the Board has watched care-
fully the Fund’s growth during
the past two decades, from its first
year of operation in 1933 when
505 Washington and Lee alumni
gave a total of $3,724 until last
year when 2,105 contributors
swelled the University’s income
with gifts totaling $44,520. More-
over, we expect to see each of these
records surpassed this year.

Despite these encouraging gains,
however, we must face the acknow-
ledged fact that there are many
University needs as yet unsatisfied.

This fact has led us to compare
carefully Washington and Lee’s
Fund with those of similar high-
ranking institutions; and the com-
parison has forced us to the con-
clusion that many gains are still
to be made.

These studies, along with our
considered judgment of the latent
interest of alumni in the Univer-
sity, have convinced us that the
Fund can be substantially im-
proved. To this end, and patterned
after the practice of the more suc-
cessful Funds at other colleges, the
Alumni Board of Trustees, with
the endorsement of the University’s
Administration, has authorized me
as president to appoint an Alumni

Rogers

Scott

Fund Committee to direct the so-
licitation and collection of the an-
nual Alumni Fund. I have named
the following Alumni to this im-
portant Committee: Col. Milton
B. Rogers, ’?17, chairman, utilities
executive, Lexington, Virginia;
Paul C. Buford, ’13, vice-chairman,
president, Shenandoah Life Insur-
ance Company, Roanoke, Virginia;
H. Graham Morison, ’30, partner,
Morison, Clapp & Abrahams,
Washington, D.C.; Kenneth P.
Lane, °36, executive, David M.
Lea, Inc., Richmond, Virginia;
George B. Wilkinson, ’26, south-
ern sales manager, Lane Paper Co.,
Charlotte, North Carolina; and I.
M. Scott, ’37, executive, Winner
Manufacturing Company, Trenton,

_ New Jersey.

In addition to the foregoing, the
president and secretary of the
Alumni Association will serve as
ex-officio members.

The Alumni Fund Committee
held its initial meeting in the
Alumni Offices on October 17,

Webster

 

Morison

Lane

March 15, and continue for two
months. (The Committee reaf-
firmed the long-held belief of the
Alumni Association that the Class
Agent system has been and will
continue to be the core of an ef-
fective program.)

3. Beginning about May 15 and
continuing through the close of the
campaign, personal solicitations
will be conducted within selected
geographical areas.

4. About two weeks before the
close of the campaign, a final gen-
eral mailing of the self-mailer type
will be sent to all alumni who have
not yet contributed.

5. The campaign will close on
June 30 in order to make the Fund
year coincide more closely with the
fiscal year of both the Alumni
Association and the University.

The Alumni Fund Committee
has pledged itself to spare no effort
in presenting and interpreting to
each alumnus the needs of Wash-
ington and Lee and the way in
which his participation in the new

Acting upon Conviction

1953, and adopted the following
Fund program for 1954.

1. The campaign will open with
a general mailing to all alumni
from the Fund Committee about
February 1.

2. The second phase of the
Fund program, that of the Class
Agents’ letters, will begin about

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

by WiLLiAM L. WeEBsTER, 712
President, Alumni Association

Fund program can be of valuable
assistance in satisfying those needs.
This pledge is based upon the
Committee’s deep conviction that
there is in the alumni body a great
potential for future usefulness that
can and will be developed to the
everlasting credit of Washington

and Lee.

 

The University

“... for one more year Washing-
ton and Lee has met measurably
well its opportunity and has been
faithful to the trust.” Such were the
encouraging words of President
Francis P. Gaines in his annual re-
port™ to the Board of Trustees
which met on November 14 to
transact the University’s business
and to discuss the activities and
progress of the past year.

Dean of the University James G.

*For the most part, material in this
section is taken, much of it verbatim,
from the annual reports made by the
President and other administrative
officers to the University’s Board of
Trustees.

4,

Leyburn called it “the first normal
year since the depression began in
1929,” but was quick to point out
that normality does not imply dull-
ness. “Like most institutions,” he
said, “the University divides it-
self, in both faculty and student
body, between those who resist
change and those who, in varying
degree, welcome it. The issues
upon which faculty members and
students divide are, of course, not
often identical, and there are shift-
ing alignments rather than conser-
vative and liberal parties. All of
this makes for liveliness, sometimes
even to the point of acrimony; and
it seems to guarantee that normal

<@ Members of the Class of ’57 were
introduced to the University and to
each other during the annual Freshman
Camp at Natural Bridge.

years will not lead to complacency
at the University.”

Encouraging also are other evi-
dences that serve to guarantee
against complancency.

TowaArRD GREATER SERVICES.
“Thanks to another generous re-
sponse,” Dr. Gaines informed the
Board, “we seem to have assured
for the University the new class-
room building, sorely needed for
enlarging services. It is my hope
that this structure will be in use
by the fall of 1954.” If everything
goes according to plan, this build-
ing will occupy a site (currently
being used as a parking lot) at the
north end of the back-campus, and
will face the McCormick Library,
which is at the south end of the
mall. The building will contain
eight classrooms, eight offices, a
small auditorium, and a fine arts
wing.

... AND BETTER Spirit. Look-
ing to another University need,
student leaders during the past
year conducted what amounted to
a campaign of education, especially
in fraternity houses, to show the
advantages of a freshman com-
mons and upperclass dormitory and
to answer objections to it. To fresh-
man counselors, O.D.K., and the
Christian Council, the opportunities
inherent in having freshmen (and
others who wish to do so) eat in a
common dining hall, would do
much to develop friendships within
the first-year class that would re-
sult in valuable additions both to
class and school spirit. These in-
terested parties made a strong case,
with the result that the Board of
Trustees authorized initial pro-
cedures looking to the construction
of such a building. The first step
was to send a committee of the
faculty and administration on a
summertime study-tour of other
institutions where similar buildings
are in operation.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

NEEDED: SCHOLARSHIPS. Ac-
cording to Dean Leyburn, two of
the University’s greatest needs—
assuming that those for the provi-
sion of more classroom space and
a freshman commons and upper-
class dormitory are about to be
met—concern scholarships and the
alumni. “Io my mind,” he said,
“our most immediate present need
is increased scholarship aid. We
have repeated evidence that fine
boys from families of moderate
means cannot come to Washington
and Lee. Our student body begins
to show definite signs of losing its
widely representative quality: there
are fewer students each year from
small towns and high schools in
the South, and more from Northern
cities and preparatory schools;
likewise, there are fewer men each
year from the families of ministers
and others of comparable income
levels. This shift may not yet be a
trend, but it will become one if we
cannot attract outstanding § stu-
dents, from whatever schools and
towns, from whatever families and
parts of the country, by scholar-
ship aid. ...I believe it is impera-
tive that we establish several
scholarships, competitive in nature,
each of which would pay from
$1,200 to $1,500 a year for four
years. Those institutions which
have established such scholarships
have enormously increased their
prestige and academic records.”

ALUMNI UNDERSTANDING.
“Our next important need,” Dean
Leyburn continued, “relates to
alumni. ...I believe the majority
of our alumni would wholeheart-
edly welcome the reiterated state-
ment that this University believes
itself first and foremost an educa-
tional institution, that scholarship
is respected and encouraged, that
the intellectual triumphs of stu-
dents and faculty are more grati-
fying to us than victories in sports,
and that the University intends to
spend much more money in schol-
arship aid to students than to ath-
letes.”

A BaLancep BupcGe_Et. In his
annual report Treasurer Earl 5S.
Mattingly reported that for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1953,
the University had operated with
a balanced budget despite expend}-
tures totaling more than one million
dollars. He also reported assets
totaling $9,814,779, an increase
of nearly $300,000 over the pre-
ceding year. In addition, the Uni-
versity’s interest in the principal
of two trusts, based on the market
value of the assets of those trusts,
now amounts to more than one mil-
lion dollars. This represents an in-
crease of more than $200,000 over
the previous year.

JoInT COOPERATION. Destined
to play an increasingly important
role in University finance is the re-
cently created Virginia Founda-
tion for Independent Colleges, a
corporate group founded by twelve
Virginia colleges which derive no
tax support. The V. F. I. C. was
organized (1) to interpret the aims,
functions, and needs of the mem-
ber colleges with a view to a better
understanding of their importance
to the state and nation, (2) to so-
licit and receive funds for their
benefit and use, and (3) to foster
and promote their progress and
general welfare.

“It is our hope,” Dr. Gaines de-
clared in his Board report, “that the
[Virginia Foundation] may make
joint appeal to sources of income
which might not be disposed or
even able to help any one institu-
tion, sources that may, however,
support the cause as such, and thus
empower the agencies that sustain
that cause. Beginnings of this
movement are small; attainments as
yet are limited; possibilities are
creat.”

Washington and Lee is well
represented in Foundation activi-
ties. Dr. Gaines 1s currently serv-
ing as president; James R. Caskie,
06, Rector of the University’s
board, is a member of the Founda-
tion’s Board of Trustees; and Lea

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Booth, ’40, formerly Director of
Public Relations at Washington
and Lee, serves as executive sec-
retary.

THE LAW SCHOOL

Dean Clayton E. Williams re-
ported to the Board with regard to
significant activities of the Law
School during the past year. In par-
ticular he called attention to the
inauguration of an active program
by the Washington and Lee Stu-
dent Bar Association. The Ameri-
can Law Student Association was
formed in St. Louis in 1949 under
the auspices of the American Bar
Association. Although the Uni-
versity’s Law School was a charter
member, the local chapter did not
organize until 1951-52, and only
the groundwork could be laid dur-
ing that year. ‘The Association be-
gan its work enthusiastically dur-
ing 1952-53 and took over spon-
sorship of the Moot Court work.
This, together with the opening of
the handsome new Moot Court
room, greatly increased both the
interest in this work and its effec-
tiveness.

Dean Williams also noted that a
special committee of the faculty
is now studying the curriculum
with a view of making a report dur-
ing the coming year as to the advis-
ability of any changes that would
seem appropriate in order to give
our students the best possible in-
struction in law.

FACULTY

SALARIES INCREASED. Dr.
Gaines commented on the salary
raise of 5 per cent that the Board
had voted at its June meeting. It
was the seventh raise granted since
the close of World War II. “They
have been small raises,” he said,
“and they have not yet been ade-
quate raises. Undoubtedly, how-
ever, they bring encouragement
and actual help to the competent
and faithful men who make up our
faculty and staff.”

“The fact remains,” added

5

 

Donald E. Smith

His office became a reality
(Story on page 2)

Dean Leyburn, “that the chief ele-
ment of security for a teacher is an
adequate salary. As compared with
institutions of high academic stand-
ing, Washington and Lee ranks...
near the median. It should rank
near the top.”

BENEFITS AppED. There are
other compensations allied with
University teaching: the security of
tenure in the higher ranks, the con-
genial environment of a college
town, and various group Insurance
plans in which faculty members
may participate, among them the
social security program and a broad
group policy for hospital care. An-
other aid to faculty members with
families was provided when the
Board agreed, at the recommenda-
tion of the faculty, to share in the
Faculty Children’s Tuition Ex-
change. Under this plan, sons and
daughters of faculty members may
attend, without tuition charges, any
of sixty-three cooperating colleges.
In turn, Washington and Lee
agrees to accept, tuition-free, as
many faculty children from other
colleges in the group as our faculty
members send to them.

SCHOLARSHIP ENHANCED. In
addition to faculty salaries and
benefits, faculty accomplishments

6

 

and the contribution the Univer-
sity’s grants-in-aid program has
made to them should be empha-
sized. In the opinion of many
faculty members, this program,
initiated in 1951 when the Carne-
sie Foundation made the first of
three annual gifts of $8,333 each
for “the improvement of instruc-
tion,” has proved to be one of the
most stimulating developments of
recent years. It is rarely possible
for an instructor to incur the per-
sonal expense of research in li-
braries outside of Lexington, of
secretarial work, of travel, and tui-
tion at research universities. Conse-
quently, the grants have released
the pent-up scholarly investigations
of many faculty members.

It should be noted that the Board
of Trustrees has voted to continue
the grants-in-aid program with
University funds. The significance
of its doing so is indicated by the
fact that during the three years
the program operated on Carnegie
Foundation funds, more than half
the eligible members of the faculty
applied for and received grants. In
all, sixty-three individual awards
were made with the result that
twenty-two books and_ learned
articles have been published or are
in preparation.

 

Mrs. Letitia PaTE Evans
who died at her home in Hot
Springs, Virginia, on November
14, remembered Washington and
Lee generously in her will. After
the payment of certain cash be-
quests, the residue of her estate
goes Into a foundation. Of the in-
come from this foundation, Wash-
ington and Lee is to receive fifteen
per cent in perpetuity.

Dr. Gaines said, “We shall not
know for some time exactly what
amount the University is to re-
celve from this legacy. I am hope-
ful, however, that it will prove to
be among the large and important
gifts in our institutional history.”

 

There are other ways in which
these grants achieve the announced
purpose of improving instruction.
Instructors are given an opportuni-
ty to renew intensive study of their
subjects in libraries, in the field, in
courses at other universities, and
abroad. They have the leisure and
means to prepare new courses for
the curriculum. The grant makes
it possible for a teacher to bring his
materials up to date, to learn the
latest developments in his subject
by study with authorities, to inaug-
urate new lines of study that might
prove to be contributions to learn-
ing. Moreover, the award of a grant
is a stimulating evidence that the
University and one’s colleagues are
interested in the scholarship of
faculty members, the advancement
of their reputation in the scholarly
field, and the publication of their
researches.

UNDERGRADUATES

PotitricAL REForm. “To my
mind the spring of 1953 will be
remembered gratefully by future
students because of two student
achievements: a political reform
movement, and activity in behalf of
a freshman commons [see above]
and upperclass dormitory,” wrote
Dean Leyburn in his report to the
Board. As for political reform, he
was referring to the clique system,
which has long ruled student poli-
tics and which was attacked in
the autumn in a manifesto signed
by prominent juniors. Their criti-
cism resulted in the appointment
of a representative committee to
study the system and make recom-
mendations. After months of con-
ference, the committee proposed an
amendment to the Constitution of
the Student Body, to guarantee
wide representation in elective of-
fices and to eliminate monopoly
control of office by one party. The
amendment, though it received a
plurality, lacked the necessary ma-
jority approval, and so failed. In-
deed, many friends of the reform

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

felt that the amendment proposed
an artificial and unrealistic system.
Discussion of student policies,
however, had the practical effect of
encouraging political activity, with
the result that one fraternity, by
shifting its party allegiance,
brought the two groups into ap-
proximate equality of potential
strength. Spring elections resulted
in a wider distribution of officers
than has occurred in many years.
(The faculty notes with approval
that the president and vice-presi-
dent of the student body are of
different parties and are both mem-
bers of Phi Beta Kappa.) It re-
mains to be seen how permanent
is the political change achieved.

OUTSTANDING SCHOLARSHIP.
Student scholarship came in for
its share of attention, too, par-
ticularly since seniors set new
records for the University in the
matter of fellowship awards for
graduate study. Three men re-
ceived Fulbright Scholarships for
a year of study abroad, and a
fourth declined his award. (Each
year since the scholarships were
established the University has had
one Fulbright Scholar.) The val-
edictorian of the class received a
handsome fellowship from the Na-
tional Research Council. Other
seniors received a Danforth Fel-

 

Joseph L. Lanier

lowship and a Rotary Club Fellow-
ship (for study in Britain). Two
seniors, appointed to fellowships
from the General Education Board,
declined them, one to go into ser-
vice, and the other to accept a dif-
ferent award.

ABILITY IN Economics. Nor
was this all. At the first Forum
in Economics, sponsored by the
New York Stock Exchange and
various banking investment firms,
a Washington and Lee _ student
made so excellent an impression
that the University was asked this
summer to name two student rep-

 

J. Stewart Buxton

resentatives for the 1953 Forum.
This is all the more remarkable
since only thirty students are
chosen from the whole country.

LITERARY DisTINcTION. In the
literary field, the student editors of
Shenandoah achieved for their pub-
lication an enviable position as one
of the esteemed critical and literary
journals of the country. Proof of
this came when it was singled
out to receive the $300 Bryher
Award for literary distinction. “I
know of no other publication in
the country under student editor-
ship,” Dean Leyburn stated, “that
has such a record of achievement—
especially without subsidization.”

The late Clarence Avery

TRUSTEES

CLARENCE RENSHAW AVERY,
member of the University Board
of Trustees since 1941, died Sep-
tember 28, 1953, at his home in
Chattanooga, Tennessee, follow-

ing a lingering illness. For many

years he had been one of Chat-
tanooga’s most prominent civic,
church and industrial leaders.

Born in Pensacola, Florida, Oc-
tober 25, 1891, Mr. Avery was
educated in the Pensacola Classical
School, from which he graduated
in 1910, and came to Washington
and Lee class of 1914. From 1917
to 1919 he was captain in the field
artillery, U.S.A.

After doing engineering work in
Pensacola, Mr. Avery went to
the Chattanooga Glass Company,
and in 1934 was elected president
and general manager of the com-
pany, a position he held until his
death. He was a director of the
American National Bank and Trust
Company of Chattanooga; the Cin-
cinnati Coca-Cola Bottling Com-
pany, and of the National Associa-

tion of Manufacturers; president of —

the ‘Tennessee Association of Man-
ufacturers; past president of the
Chattanooga Manufacturers Asso-
ciation; and a member of the board
of the Glass Containers Manufac-
turing Institute.

Mr. Avery was closely associated
with the First Presbyterian Church
of Chattanooga, where he was an
elder and for many years served
as superintendent of the Sunday
School. At the time of his death
he was teacher of the Men’s Bible
Class. He was a leader in many
civic and charitable organizations.

Survivors include his wife, Mrs.
Mary: Elizabeth Lupton Avery; one
son, Lupton, ’41, a daughter, Mrs.
Frank F. Duff, and four grand-
children, Lupton Avery, Jr., and
Clarence R. Avery, II, Frank Duff,
Jr., and Clarence Avery Duff.

J. STEWART Buxton, B.S. 736,
Memphis cotton broker, and
JOosEPH LAMAR LANIER, B.S. 727,
textile manufacturer from West
Point, Georgia, were elected mem-
bers of the Washington and Lee
University Board of Trustees, at
its meeting here on November 14.

Their elections fill vacancies on
the board caused by the deaths of
former Virginia Governor George
Campbell Peery, ’97, of Tazewell,
and Clarence Avery, ’14, of Chat-
tanooga, during the past 13
months.

Buxton, who was awarded a
bachelor of science degree from
the School of Commerce in 1936,
has taken his oath of office. He was
on the campus attending an Alum-
ni Board meeting when elected to
the university board.

Lanier, 4:7, who graduated with
the class of 1927, accepted his ap-
pointment by telephone. He is pres-
ident and director of the West
Point Manufacturing Company and
Dixie Cotton Mills. He has been
connected with the manufacturing
company since he completed his
college training at Lowell Textile
Institute. He is also vice-president
and director of the Lanett Bleach-
ing and Dye Works, director of
the Wehadke Yarn Mills and First
National Bank, all of West Point;
a trustee of the Institute of Textile
Technology, Charlottesville, Vir-
ginia, and of the Girls Training

8

School, Birmingham, Alabama. He
is the father of three children, Joe,
Jr., being in his third year at
Washington and Lee. During
World War II he served as civilian
consultant for the Quartermaster
General ETO, in Paris.

Buxton, 39, served as director

of the Memphis Merchants Ex-
change in 1946 and is a member
of the Chicago Board of Trade. He
is connected with the E. E. Buxton
and Company cotton firm. The
father of two children, he served
with the Navy as a lieutenant dur-

ing World War II.

The Class of 195'7

ee 205th opening of Washing-
ton and Lee University found
it with the largest freshman camp
in the history of the school, 258
students being present.

When the freshmen returned
from their get acquainted period at
Natural Bridge, they found that
their class numbered 285. Six
transfer students were also on
campus. ‘otal enrollment was
1,007.

The freshmen could take pride
in their acceptance at the Univer-
sity. They were picked from 672
who completed applications, a 10
percent increase from last year.
Although the 1952 class numbered
300, the 1953 class was deliber-
ately made smaller to insure ade-
quate room in the dormitory.

Enrolled in the law school were
104 students, the exact figure for
the same time last year.

The freshmen were a cosmopol-
itan group, 140 of their number
coming from the South and 108
from the North. The remainder
came from other sections and for-
eign countries. Entering from prep
schools were 134 new men while
14.9 came from public high schools.
Here the public schools gained
1 percent from last year’s number.

Dean of Students Frank Gilliam
said the new class made a gratify-
ingly good increase in their col-
lege board averages, over those
registered by the 1952 freshman.
These latter in turn averaged
higher on the exams than did those
entering in 1951.

 

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

Dean Gilliam said the increase
in scores has been substantiated
in academic progress. Two years
ago there were four advanced
freshman English classes, as com-
pared to eight sections of compo-
sition. This year the situation is
reversed, eight advanced sections
and four of composition. Last year
122 freshmen made 211 U’s (indic-
ative of unsatisfactory work in a
course) in the October report of
the faculty. This year only 100
freshmen received a comparatively
meager 164 “unsatisfactories.”

A further gratifying fact was
the large number of entering stu-
dents who chose Washington and
Lee in preference to some of the
strongest colleges in the country,
at which they had also been ac-
cepted.

However, Dean Gilliam added
that we must face the fact that
though our enrollment figures are
increasingly encouraging, Wash-
ington and Lee’s weakest point is
her increased tuition. This, he said,
makes it more difficult to obtain
students from Southern high
schools.

“Many of these students are cer-
tainly the type which we would
like to have in our student body.
The alumni could help us here by
bringing Washington and Lee to
the attention of those students, and
the students to our attention.”

In the resident classification of
students Washington and Lee can
still lay claim to being one of the
most cosmopolitan universities in
the country. Among her 1,007 stu-
dents are young men from 36
states the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Bermuda,
and 15 foreign countries.

Leading the list is Virginia with
207 favored sons on campus. Mary-
land follows with 82, New York’s
77 1s a close third, while West
Virginia closes out the top five with
57.

The beginning of school also
found 232 men pledging frater-
nities. Delta Tau Delta led with
22 new pledges. Phi Delta Theta
pledged 19 while the Delta Upsi-

lon’s garnered 18 new freshmen.

While the percentage of the
freshmen “going fraternity” was
less than previous years (81 per
cent this year), many of the re-
maining freshmen are now join-
ing during deferred rushing.

 

The Fall Sports Season had

A Happy Ending

It was a football season that
opened with a rush, seemed to
stretch on endlessly in the middle
and ended all too soon.

Undefeated in November! That’s
the fond memory the 1953 Gen-
erals left behind. Victories in suc-
cession over Davidson, Virginia
and William and Mary. And all by

convincing scores.

The happy ending to the season
actually started November 7 in
Winston-Salem where the Gen-
erals, losers of six straight, met
Davidson, also loser of six in a

10

row. The convincing 34-7 victory
set the Generals rolling until the
season’s final whistle blew on No-
vember 21 in Williamsburg.

Sandwiched between the Wins-
ton-Salem and Williamsburg wins
was the Homecoming victory
against the University of Virginia.
This was most-wanted and most-
enjoyed. It made the Homecom-
ing celebration complete.

Advance ticket sales to alumni
for the Virginia game were the
heaviest in the 32-year career of
Athletic Director Cap’n Dick

 

Bolt hits pay dirt against Virginia

Smith. This despite the two teams’
records up to that time. Lexington
eagerly awaited the invasion of the
Wahoos and student enthusiasm
was boiling over. Fraternity houses,
cleverly decorated and planning
for their own parties, had made
banner preparations. The Alumni
Association welcomed a_record-
sized gathering at its luncheon two
hours before the kickoff.

The entire set of plans threat-
ened to collapse 18 seconds after
the game started. In that brief
period a Virginia back, Henry
Strempek, had run back the open-
ing kickoff 93 yards for a touch-
down. The plans surely sagged
moments after that crushing start
when the Generals fumbled on
their first play from scrimmage.

That fumble, as things turned
out, gave the Wahoos their last
chance to cheer. The Generals re-
fused to crack, held for downs and
promptly marched 64 yards for a
touchdown behind the superb
quarterbacking of Joe Lindsey and
the flashy running of Halfback

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

Carl Bolt. Big Harold Brooks kick-
ed the extra point to put the Gen-
erals ahead to stay.

Before the quarter had ended
the Generals had another score,
moving 24 yards in six plays for
the touchdown. Two more followed
in the second quarter, the first on
an 84-yard drive and the second
on a march of 56 yards. It mat-
tered little that Virginia managed
one score in the middle of all the

WA&L parades.

The second half was tame by
comparison. The Generals con-
tinued to march but penalties and
a fumble or two held them score-
less. Virginia could make no ser-
ious threats.

The victory by the 27-13 score
set off a celebration second only
to the one that followed the 42-14
victory over the Wahoos in 1951.
Coach Carl Wise, who had died a
thousand times during the long Oc-
tober stretch, was carried from the
field on the shoulders of the Gen-
erals.

To make the day a clean sweep
for Washington and Lee, Coach

Dick Miller’s varsity and fresh-

man cross-country teams scored
wins over the Virginia harriers.
Captain Walter Diggs, the newly-
crowned cross-country champion of
the Big Six, led the way for the
varsity.

Before the shouting had sub-
sided and before the decorations
had been ripped down by cele-
brants, the Alumni Association’s
awards for the best decorated
houses went to: (1) Sigma Nu (2)
Sigma Chi (3) Zeta Beta Tau (4)
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

What happened the following
week at Williamsburg was almost
as much fun; there just wasn’t the
Homecoming crowd around to en-
joy it.

William and Mary had an im-
posing record. The Indians’ had
blanked Richmond, 21-0, the week
before and were favored to gain
at least a tie for the State title by
defeating the Generals.

But the November Generals had
tasted two victories and were hun-
ery for a third. They dominated
early play and moved 70 yards in
12 plays during the second quar-
ter to lead, 7-0. W&M tied it up
on the passing of Charlie Sumner
in the third period—but the tie
lasted for only a few seconds.

Carl Bolt dashed 90 yards on the
kickoff following the Indian’s score
and this brilliant run ended the
contest, for all intents. The Gener-
als bagged three more scores 1n the
final period, Bolt getting two of
them and Tackle Jay Heckmann
earning the other by blocking a
punt.

The final score: Washington and
Lee 33, W&M 7.

For Seniors Bill McHenry, the
fine All-State center; Quarterback
Joe Lindsey, the leading gainer in
the Southern Conference; Guard
Tom Fieldson, a three-year regular;
Tackle Jay Heckmann, Fullback
Ciro Barcellona and Halfback War-
ren Moody the victory was the fi-
nal one of their careers at Wash-
ington and Lee.

To celebrate the victory the
alumni, friends and team were
guests of the Peninsula and Rich-
mond Alumni Chapters at a cock-
tail party in the Game Room of

the Williamsburg Inn. The sea-
son ended on the happiest possible
note.

A resume of the season follows:

Shepherd College, of West Vir-
ginia, a newcomer to the W&L
schedule, provided little opposition
in the opening game. The Generals,
their regulars playing about half
the time, rolled for more than 600
yards to a 47-0 victory. Coach
Wise had scheduled the Rams late
in the Spring to give the team a
game under its collective belts be-
fore tangling with Maryland,

North Carolina and West Virginia. _

The Generals moved to College
Park and the following Saturday
the results failed to provide a sur-
prise. For nearly a quarter, how-
ever, W&L had the upper hand,
moving deep into Terp territory on
a drive. Captain McHenry was
taken from the field with a shoul-
der injury that was to keep him
out of play until October 17 and,
moments later, Halfback Eddie
Landis, who had sparked the drive,
had to be benched with a charley
horse. The Terps began to move,
scoring late in the first period and
going on from there to win, 53
to O.

Hopes were still high that the
Generals might surprise George

 

And bad news it was! Minks 27, Wahoos 13

Barclay’s North Carolina team at
Chapel Hill the following week.
The Tar Heels never did stop Lind-
sey, Barcellona, Sargent et al but
fumbles did. Eight of them ruined
drive after drive. It mattered lit-
tle that the Generals outgained the
Tar Heels, 308 yards to 272. The
final score told only that North
Carolina won, 39 to O.

The long trip to Morgantown
for the West Virginia contest was
made longer with the knowledge
that Captain McHenry, End Buck
Pratt and three other squad mem-
bers would be unable to play. Still,
the Generals made a ball game of
it for 55 minutes against a mas-
sive Mountaineer team that scored
seven straight victories before
losing. With five minutes to go the
Generals trailed, 27-14, and were
on the march. That old bugaboo, a
fumble, cropped up again, West
Virginia capitalized on it to score
and W&L hopes died. An inter-
cepted W&L pass gave the Moun-
taineers another late score in the
40-14 defeat for the Big Blue.

~ Returning to their own class and
bolstered by the return of Captain
McHenry, the Generals welcomed
the invasion of Richmond’s im-
proved Spiders on October 17,
Lindsey, Carl Bolt, Don Weaver
and the other ball-carriers rolled
at will during the first half to post
a 19-7 lead. The game changed

12

its complexion completely with the
beginning of the third period. The
Spiders took command but could
not score until the opening of the
fourth quarter. The exhausted
Generals—it was an _ unusually
warm day for October—fought
back but the manpower just wasn’t
there. Richmond, blessed with 48
players, alternated teams during
the second half and went on to win,
27-19. It was a bitter pill to swal-
low.

For the first time in 20 years,
the Generals traveled to Blacks-
burg for VPI’s homecoming where
a crowd of 11,000 hoped to see the
Gobblers score their first win over
WA&L since 1947. Taking advan-
tage of a brisk wind and capitaliz-
ing on early W&L miscues, VPI
scored twice in the opening quar-
ter and once in the second. The
Generals rallied in the final two
periods to play the Techs to a
standstill but the early lead could
not be overcome. Tech won, 32-12.

Under-rated George Washing-
ton, gaining momentum as the sea-
son progressed, rubbed salt in the
W&L wounds the following Sat-
urday by utilizing superior forces.
The Generals’ attack bogged down
for the first time. Still, the home
team managed a 7-6 third quarter
lead before its battered and bruised
players succumbed to constant
pressure of playing against fresh
men. The Colonials won, 25-7.

Davidson, like W&L had lost
six in a row when the two old
rivals met at neutral Wiainston-
Salem. It was supposed to be a
close ball game but the Generals,
off to a fast start, rolled to a 34-7
win and used the first-stringers
sparingly. The momentum from
that game carried over to the home-
coming contest with Virginia.

Cross-Country

Captain Walt Diggs breezed
home ahead of the pack in the Big
Six meet to give W&L the indi-
vidual winner.» The team finished

second behind VMI. Coach Dick

Miller’s team finished fourth a
couple of weeks later in the South-
ern Conference meet. In all, W&L
showed steady improvement in
compiling a 4-4 dual meet record
and can be expected to continue to
move upward next year with the
addition of several fine frosh run-
ners. The record (low score wins):
W&L 15, Hampden-Sydney 48;
W&L 35, W&M 77 and Bridge-
water 27; W&L 43, Lynchburg
17; W&L 59%, Davidson 63/2,
and VMI 18; W&L 30, Roanoke
25; W&L 22, Virginia 33. Gen-
erals finished second in the Big Six
meet and fourth in Southern Con-
ference meet.

Soccer

Coach Norm Lord’s soccer team,
the only one in the Southern Con-
ference, was handicapped by a lack
of scoring punch and inexperienced
personnel. The Generals lost eight
contests. Co-Captain Jim Lewis
was voted the most valuable player
and Carl Bailey was the most im-
proved. Next year the squad will be
bolstered by Bill Boyle and Beldon
Butterfield, up from the freshman
squad, and should be much im-
proved. The season’s record: W&L
O, Virginia 5; W&L 3, Roanoke 6;
W&L 1, Duke 4; W&L 1, North
Carolina 4; W&L 0, State 6; W&L
O, Roanoke 3; W&L 1, Virginia
6; W&L 0, Maryland 3.

OMETIMES overlooked in

the accounts of Chief Jus-

tice Vinson’s carer as a prominent
figure in Government for 30 years
is the view of him as a home-loving,
warm-hearted man who preferred
bridge and baseball to Washing-

ton social life.

I roomed with the Chief Jus-
tice’s son, Fred, Jr., at Washing-
ton and Lee University and played
on the baseball team with him from
1947 to 1949. During those years
and since then, I have known the
Chief Justice as a bridge partner
or opponent. I have also known
him as a dignified, but friendly
man who loved to talk baseball
and other sports by the hour.

Sunday night was. bridge night
at the Vinson apartment in the
Sheraton Park Hotel. Every week,
“The Judge,” as he preferred to
be called, Fred, South Trimble,
III, and I played six rubbers while
Mrs. Vinson watched television.
Jimmy Vinson, now in the Army,
played when he was at home. Ev,
the Vinsons’ housekeeper since be-
fore young Fred was born, served
a light snack around 11. Often
Mrs. Vinson would make fudge
or Ice cream.

The judge looked forward to
these informal sessions, turning
down numerous invitations so he
could keep Sunday night free. He
played a good game with little
or no conversation, erring if at all
on the optimistic rather than con-
servative side in the bidding.

A friend of both former Pres-
ident ‘Truman and President Ejisen-
hower, the Judge played cards
with both frequently. He had poker
sessions with President Truman
aboard the yacht Williamsburg, at
Shangri-La and Key West. He
played bridge with President Eisen-
hower at the White House.

But according to Mrs. Vinson he
was never so happy as when he
was playing bridge or talking with
friends of Fred or Jimmy. He was

athletics.

In September, 1948, Fred, Jr.,
returned from vacationing in
Washington to play third base for
Big Island, Virginia, a semi-pro
team, in the league championship
games. The Judge decided he
would like to watch the games.

I was returning to W&L for
football practice and went with
them. The three of us drove to
Lexington, then over to Big
Island—just a wide spot in the road
but swollen that weekend for the
big games. The Judge and I took
seats near the home team bench.

With Big Island trailing, 2-3, in
the last of the eighth inning, Fred
beat out a bunt. He was still on
first with two out. The Big Island
manager was a local man who

*This story by Mr. Bell appeared in
the Washington Evening Star, Septem-
ber 9, 1953.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

knew little about baseball so the
Judge decided to help him.

First he asked me if Fred was as
fast as ever. I said, yes, and the
Judge signaled the manager over.
“Send him down,” he whispered.
The manager gave the sign and
Fred stole second. The next man
singled and Fred came in to tie
the score.

In the tenth inning the first Big
Island batter got on first. Again
the Judge called the manager over.
“Put him down,” he said. The bat-
ter sacrificed the runner to second,
and the next hitter won the game
with a base hit. In later years the
Judge loved to hear Fred or me
tell how he managed Big Island to
victory in the playoffs.

The Judge was sleeping on the
lower bunk of Fred’s double-decker
bed in the Beta Theta Pi fraternity

house at W&L and that Sunday
night he called for a bridge game.

13

 

We obtained a fourth and sat down
for “a couple of rubbers” since I
had to get up early the next day
for football practice.

Fred and I played the Judge and
his partner a set game and at mid-
night I tried to leave. The Judge
asked what the score was and
finding they were behind called
for another rubber. At 1:30 [ at-
temped to end the game again. The
Judge was still behind and authori-
tatively called for “one more rub-
ber,” explaining to me there would
be little practice that day he was
sure. At 3 a.m. the rubber was
completed and the Judge asked the
score. He and his partner were fin-
ally ahead.

“Well, it’s very late,” he said
with a smile, “I guess we all ought
to go to bed.”

The next day after having told
the coach previously that I was
in perfect shape, I became sick in
the middle of practice. The Judge
always maintained it was my poor
condition, not the late bridge game
that caused the illness.

The Vinsons were frequent visi-
tors to Washington and Lee when
Fred and later, Jimmy were there.
Once the Judge came down during
rush week when the fraternities
were vieing for the best freshmen.
The Judge was a Phi Delta Theta
but Fred had promised that his
father would be at the Beta house
for dinner.

Dinner arrived but the Chief
Justice did not. The Judge finally
came to the Beta house at 10:30
when all rush parties were over for
the night. To our horror he had
been at the Phi Delta house for
five hours.

“No one asked me to the Beta
house,” he laughed, “and the Phi
Deltas did.” :

Fred was not popular with the
Betas for a while.

Recently, the Vinsons became
grandparents. They made a special
trip to Kentucky to see Jimmy’s
son and brought back glowing ac-
counts of the baby. The Judge was

14

a proud grandfather, complete with

photographs of his new-born grand-

son, when he returned to Wash-
ington.

The Vinsons entertained hard-
ly at all. However, they were hosts
to friends of Fred and Jimmy fre-
quently for dinner. Until a few
years ago they gave a big Christ-
mas eve party for their sons’
friends every year.

At the annual Army-Navy foot-
ball game, again the Judge thought
first of his sons’ friends. The Chief
Justice and Mrs. Vinson were often
the guests of the President, but the
Chief Justice’s box was always
filled with young people.

And it was with young people
the Judge always looked to talk.
He would tell stories of his college
days as a shortshop for Centre
College and semipro teams in Ken-
tucky. He liked to boast a little
about the time he raced from his

Three Ed's
with

shortstop position to the left field
boxes at Griffith Stadium to catch
a foul ball in a congressional base-
ball game. He discussed all sports
with an expert’s opinion.

The Judge was a frequent visi-
tor to Griffith Stadium to watch
the Nats or Redskins play. He sel-
dom missed a sporting event on
television. It is no surprise that the
night before he died the Judge and
Fred had been watching a football
game on television.

This is the Chief Justice I knew.
To me he was not only a personal
friend but more like a second father
whose advice was always sound.
He will be remembered by those
who knew him intimately, not only
as a great government servant, but
as a warm, bushy-browed man
with a twinkle in his eye who loved
his home with its bridge, television
and conversation more than the po-
litical arena.

The United Press

The three Washington and Lee
“Fid’s,” whose pictures appear
opposite, are handling top coverage
for the United Press Association
in some of the world’s most strate-
sic positions.

Robert Edward Jackson, A.B.
4.5, has been named chief corres-
pondent and manager of the United
Press in Italy. Edward M. Korry,
B.A. ’42, has been chief corres-
pondent and manager for France
since 1951, with headquarters in
Paris. C. Edmonds Allen, B.A. ’32,
is director of United Press special

services, with headquarters in New
York.

RoBERT Epwarp JACKSON.
Since the United Press assigned
him to London in 1949, Robert
Edward Jackson has been known
as a specialist in reporting Euro-
pean reaction to events in Korea
and the Far East.

His work in the British capital
has in the main been concerned
with political and diplomatic af-
fairs, such as the general elections,
Downing Street, the Foreign Office
and the House of Commons. But
he has covered as well stories of
wide general interest: the sinking
of the Flying Enterprise, Elizabeth
Taylor’s marriage to Michael Wild-

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

ing, the death of King George.
Jackson joined the United Press
in New York in 1947. His first
story there was the leap to freedom,
in 1948, of the Russian school-
teacher, Mrs. Oksana Kansenkina.
The late World War interrupted
Jackson’s attendance of Wash-
ington and Lee University, from
which he was finally graduated in
194.7, cum laude. His service was
in the Pacific where for a year and
a half he was communications and
deck officer, with the rank of leu-
tenant junior grade, aboard the
U. S. attack transport Cleburne.
Jackson was born January 14,
1925, in Mount Airy, North Caro-
lina. There he had his first news-
paper experience, reporting for the
Times and News, and serving as
a sports correspondent for the
Winston-Salem Journal Sentinel.
He was married to the former
Christina Margaret Reid in 1949
and they have two sons, both born
in London, Roger Reid, and Blair
Britton. He is a member of Phi
Kappa Sigma social fraternity.

Epwarp M. Korry was night
manager of the United Press bu-
reau in Berlin and the news ser-
vice’s chief Balkan correspondent
before his appointment in 1951 as
manager for France.

His coverage for the United
Press of Hungary’s trial of Cardi-

 

Ed Jackson

nal Mindszenty first made Korry’s
by-line known the world over. He
was the only press service staff
correspondent able to get to Buda-
pest for the trial.

To be a newspaper man, Korry
sacrificed a ready-made future as a
doctor. His father and others in
his family were physicians. They
prevailed upon him to take a pre-
medical course at Washington and
Lee. But while at college he worked
part time for the Richmond Times-
Dispatch, the Roanoke Times and
a news agency. When he received
his degree in 1942 he got himself
a job in the NBC newsroom in
New York.

 

Ed Allen

Korry joined the United Press
in New York later the same year.
He became radio editor, and later
radio bureau manager, before go-
ing to London in 1947. He inter-
rupted his foreign assignment in
April of the following year to
cover, for several months, the
United Nations meeting at Lake
Success.

He was born in New York in
1922, was married to Marian Pa-
tricia McCarthy July 7, 1950. He
is a member of Zeta Beta Tau so-
cial fraternity.

C. EpmMonps ALLEN was grad-
uated from Washington and Lee,
Class of 1932, cum laude. In 1933
he worked on the now defunct edi-

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

 

Ed Korry

tion of the Chicago Tribune. Spent
two years on the St. Louis Post Dis-
patch, starting in 1934.

He joined the United Press in
1936, and has been through prac-
tically the entire organization,
handling editorial and administra-
tive assignments coast to coast. The
various assignments have  in-
cluded: covering the Louisiana
election in 1940 when Sam Jones
gave the Long machine its first de-
feat in a decade by defeating Earl
Long in the gubernatorial primary;
attending the national political
conventions in 1940, 1944, 1948,
and 1952 for the United Press;
also the United Nations Confer-
ence in San Francisco in 1945.

His present job is Director of
Special Services for the United
Press. This division handles news
services for the radio and television
networks, commentators, maga-
zines, special information wires
and the collection of major features
for the Continental, British and
Oriental newspapers.

This year he spent a month in
London and Paris, establishing a
new foreign features service for
the United Press.

He was married to Helen Mc-
Creery in 1940 and they have three
children, a daughter, Alice, son,
Claxton Edmonds, III, and Mollie.
He is a member of Delta Tau
Delta social fraternity.

alumni present. Due to the fact that
the meeting was held on the week-
end of the Alabama-Tennessee
football game, played in Birming-
ham, which is a big event locally,
the attendance at the meeting was
not as great as expected. Many
alumni having out-of-town guests
or previous commitments, were un-
able to attend.

The Birmingham chapter is
planning a big meeting for all the
alumni in that area early next
spring for the purpose of organiz-
ing a strong, active chapter.

interest in entering Washington
and Lee next session. James W.
Hammett, ’41, president of the
chapter, presided.

In the course of the business ses-
sion the following officers were

try Club, preceded by a social
hour. Rev. John McCormick, 743,

gave the invocation. There were
seventy-one alumni and guests in
attendance, including several from
surrounding territory. Three of the
guests were parents of Houston
boys who are now students at the
University. Ben Ditto, ’43, presi-
dent of the chapter and Milton
Morrison, ’°38, were in charge of
preparations for the meeting.

SAN ANTONIO

When Dr. Gaines arrived in
San Antonio on October 21, he
was presented with an official
proclamation of welcome from the
Mayor and also with a souvenir
La Villita plate, which is San
Antonio’s version of the traditional
key to the city.

The dinner meeting was held
in the Tapestry Room of the St. An-
thony Hotel, with 35 persons pres-
ent including six prospective Wash-

las-Forth Worth) held a dinner
meeting at the Downtown Club

guests present, alumni and their

wives, parents of students, friends

of the University and five senior
high school students (each express-
ing interest in attending Washing-
ton and Lee). “Dr. Gaines gave an
inspirational message about ac-
tivities of the University. He even
included a bit of humor and finally
reached down inside and touched
something, to bring forth a feel-
ing of participation with him in the
dedication which he gives to the
great work which he has done.”

Business of the meeting included
the election of John Stemmons, ’31,
president of the Dallas chapter.
Harry C. Rand, ’27, will continue

VIRGINIA PENINSULA
Dr. Robert H. Tucker, former

Dean of the University, was an in-
spiring speaker at the first ladies
night meeting of the Virginia Pen-
insula Alumni Chapter on Sep-
tember 11. The meeting was held
at the James River Country Club,
at Newport News, with approx-
imately 30 alumni and guests
present.

In his talk, Dr. Tucker paid
special tribute to the high calibre of
Washington and Lee’s_ student
body and its sense of honor and
responsibility. He emphasized the
fact that the University first grew
up in a frontier region and asserted
that through the years it had main-
tained some of the fresh, eager
enterprise of the West as well as
the suavity of the Eastern seaboard
states. Emphasizing this point, he
pointed to early work which
Washington and Lee did in educa-
tion for business and public ser-
vice, especially in the contribution
of Robert E. Lee and in its early
course in public administration.

Now special consultant to the
State Department of Highways,

HarRISON KINNEY, B.A. 747,
has written the text of a remark-
able book, published in October by
Coward-McCann, telling the story
of a $75,000 full-size reproduc-
tion of Leonardo da Vinci’s relig-
ious masterpiece, “The Last Sup-

per,” now on display in a Miami,

Florida, museum, because Alfred
EK. Holton, real estate man there,
had a dream about the original.
He had read a pictorial essay in a
weekly magazine, that had told the
story of how Leonardo da Vinci’s
celebrated painting, The Last Sup-
per, was rapidly decaying on its
wall in the old monastery dining
room, now a museum in Milan.
Mr. Holton was so impressed by
his dream that he decided he would
be troubled the rest of his life if
he didn’t find some artist who
would duplicate the picture for
him. He did not want just another
copy, but a replica, the same size
and, as nearly as possible, the same
picture that da Vinci first painted.
Mr. Holton went to New York
and secured the services of Lumen
Martin Winter, a student of the
da Vinci works and a well-known
painter of murals, who consented
to undertake the commission, al-

though he considered it something
of a heady brew.

Mr. Winter went to Europe and
made an intensive study of all
available da Vinci material, mak-
ing innumerable notes and
sketches. As it stands, the original
is two-thirds gone and has been
restored six times by painters who
had very different ideas as to how
to touch it up. He said, “It was
like painting the ghost of a ghost.”
Mr. Winter brought the material
he had collected back to his New
York studio where the painting
was completed. It was exhibited
there and then claimed by Mr.
Holton and hung in the Holton
Museum on Biscayne Boulevard
in Miami, the building he had
built expressly for housing the re-
production, and the gallery where
it is now on exhibition is dimen-
sionally the same as the Milan re-
rectory, home of the original.

As a reporter for the New York-
er Magazine, covering the story of
Lumen Martin Winter’s recreation
of The Last Supper, Harrison Kin-
ney first visited Winter’s studio
when the replica was about half
completed. When Kinney met
Winter again at the press showing
of the finished painting, Coward-
McCann had interested itself in the
book possibilities behind Winter’s
achievement and Winter offered
the task of writing it to Kinney.

Kinney’s first visit to “Leonardo
Country” in Italy was sponsored
by the American Army during
World War II with which he
served for three and a half years.
He is now on the staff of the New
Yorker. His short stories have ap-
peared in such magazines as Col-
lier’s and the Saturday Evening
Post, and he has written non-fic-
tion pieces for a half dozen other
publications. He married Doris
Getsinger, a former Life magazine
reporter, and they have a daughter,
Susan Barbara.
