University Benefits By Scholarship,

NEW PHASE in Washington and
A and Lee’s educational oppor-
tunities has opened, with the estab-
lishment this fall of the Robert E.
Lee Research Fund for undergrad-
uate research activities

A gift of $300,000 from an anony-
mous donor endows the program,
and the sum of $20,000 has been
made available for appropriate ac-
tivities during the first year of the
fund’s application.

As established by the University’s
Board of Trustees, the Robert FE.
Lee Research Fund will serve three
basic purposes:

1) To promote faculty research
activities in which promising un-
dergraduates may take part as re-
search assistants or apprentices.

2) To establish research assistant-
ships or apprentices for promising
and interested undergraduates for
work during the school year and
during the summer months.

3) To encourage faculty and stu-
dent participation in interdiscipli-
nary seminars on research tech-
niques, tools, and methodology.

“It is our behef at Washington
and Lee that we should make very
effort to introduce our students to
the intellectual stimulation of re-
search and investigative study at
the earliest possible time in their
academic careers,’ President Fred
C. Cole said. ‘““We hope such work
on the undergraduate level will re-
sult in greater numbers of our
students going on to graduate
schools and advanced degrees, and
also for those who will not continue
in graduate school we feel there are
basic intrinsic benefits in such ex-
perience.”

2

President Cole said all academic
disciplines—including physical and
natural sciences, humanities, and
social sciences—will share in the
research fund’s application.

“Through their stipends as re-
search assistants and apprentices,
students will have an opportunity
to earn a portion of the costs of
their education in a way that will
be more meaningful to them than
the experiences of the usual part-
time jobs on and off campus,”’ Pres-
ident Cole declared.

Some 15 research projects invol-
ing the use of student assistants
have been submitted by Washing-
ton and Lee faculty members for

consideration. President Cole said
appropriate officials will review the
projects and recommend approval
for necessary funds.

President Cole said he hoped the
Robert E. Lee Research Fund
would help bring about a closer
relationship between the _ univer-
sity functions of teaching and re-
search.

“Particularly in an institution
such as Washington and Lee, facul-
ty research should bear the closest
relationship possible to the im-
provement of teaching and the ad-
vancement of understanding and
learning for our students,” Presi-
dent Cole said.

Research Gifts

SCHOLARSHIP FUND of more than

half a million dollars has been

set up at Washington and Lee to

honor the memory of the late

‘Thomas Ball, ‘03, California attor-
ney and philanthropist.

Valued at $587,663, the fund
represents the largest addition to
endowment for scholarship pur-
poses in the University’s history.

Mrs. Alfred I. duPont, a trustee
and long-time benefactor of the
University, established the trust
funct in memory of her brother,
Thomas Ball, who died of a heart
attack on May 24, 1960, at Hunt-
ington Memorial Hospital in Pasa-
dena, California.

Income from the ‘Thomas Ball
Scholarship Fund will be used “‘for
the education of worthy boys se-
lected by the University,” accord-
ing to terms of the trust.

President Fred C. Cole said he
expects that the first Thomas Ball
Scholarships will be granted in
Sepember, 1961.

“This gift,” he declared, “honor-
ing a distinguished alumnus of
Washington and Lee, and _ the
brother of one of its most devoted
friends, adds significantly to the
University’s capability to extend
its educational opportunity to
promising young men who need fi-
nancial assistance to come _ here.
The need for continued strength-
ening of our scholarship program
is one of the matters of greatest sig-
nificance to this University, and we
are deeply grateful that Mrs.
duPont chose to help Washington
and Lee in such an important
phase of its work.”

Thomas Ball was born in Jacks-

FALL 1960

 

The Late THOMAS BALL, ’03 Law

boro, ‘Texas, and grew up in North-
umberland county, Virginia. He
received his education in public
schools of Virginia and Maryland,
at Bickler Academy of Austin, Tex-
as, and undergraduate training at
the College of William and Mary.
He attended the Washington and
Lee School of Law in 1902-03, and
was admitted to the Virginia bar
on June 24, 1903. He moved to
California in 1906, and practiced
law in Los Angeles until his death.
His home was in San Marino, Cali-
fornia. His body was entombed in
the family cemetary at Cressfield,
Virginia.

Besides Mrs. duPont, he is sur-
vived by two other sisters, Mrs.
N. Addison Baker of Richmond,
Virginia, and Mrs. Albert J. Bow-
ley of Washington, D.C.; also, one
brother, Edward Ball of Jackson-
ville, Florida.

Mr. Ball was a member of the
Los Angeles and California Bar
Associations, the American Bar
Association, Jonathan Club, Ki-
wanis, Sons of the Revolution, So-
ciety of the Cincinnati in Virginia,
Life Member of the Virginia His-
torical Society, California Cham-
ber of Commerce, and the Los
Angeles Art Association.

The 1960 Freshman Profile:

SURVEY OF statistics relating to
A the Class of 1964, which en-
tered in September, reveals some
interesting developments. The fol-
lowing points stand out: a continu-
ing increase in the proportion of
the number of candidates from
which the same sized class was to
to be selected; a sharp up-turn in
the level of College Board Scores;
a reasonable increase in the _ pro-
portion of students from the South-
ern area; and a larger proportion
of men entering on scholarships.

When the selection of the class
was begun in February, there were
186 more “final’’ candidates than
on the same date the year before.
Acceptances were sent to 565 can-
didates out of a total of 1264. Of
the 565 offered acceptance, 324 con-
firmed acceptance and entered. ‘The
924 were 57.3 per cent of those
accepted. According to Time mag-
azine, the corresponding figure this
year for all “Ivy League” colleges
was 63 per cent.

tic Aptitude ‘Test Scores:

1958 528 553
1959 532 563
1960 548 577

By residence, 74 per cent of the
class came from the South and bor-
der states, as against 70 per cent
last year. The Atlantic Seaboard
above Maryland dropped from 22
per cent in 1959 to 18 per cent this
year, with the 8 per cent from other
areas the same each year. The total
break-down among states indicates

4

by FRANK J. GILLIAM
Dean of Students

and Director of Admissions

that Washington and Lee continues
to hold the position of having the
most widely distributed student
body of any of the men’s colleges.
The drop in the northern Atlan-
tic Seaboard attendance was largely
in the representation from Eastern
private schools, although the total
percentage of distribution _ re-
mained the same as in 1959: 55 per
cent from public schools and 45
per cent from private schools.

Virginia has the largest number
of freshmen, 76; Maryland has 24;
New York, 21; Alabama, Pennsyl-

vania and Texas, 16 each; Geor-
gia, 15; Kentucky, 14; Florida and
West Virginia, 12; with eleven
states ranging from five to ten; and
eleven other states from one to
four students.

Sixty-one sons of alumni com-
pleted applications. Forty-nine were
issued and 37 of these accepted
candidates entered. Eighty per cent
of sons of alumni who applied
were offered admission against 43
per cent of non-alumni sons ac-
cepted.

In addition to the largest amount
of scholarship grants ever awarded
freshmen in one year, a new policy
of most generous loans—on exactly
the same terms as the Government
loans—was instituted. This move
brought to the campus a _ consid-
erable number of men of need and
more than average promise who
could not meet the very exacting
academic requirements for out-
right scholarships.

Alumni Fund Out From Mothballs

N THE YEARS just prior to the Cap-
I ital Fund Drive for new facilities
in science and journalism, alumni
of Washington and Lee were sup-
porting the annual Alumni Fund
with contributions of over $100,000
per year. This is comparable to the
yield from an endowment of ap-
proximately $2,500,000, and the
University recognizes this support
from her loyal sons as of tremend-
ous Importance.

The last Fund report indicated
a participation by 35.3 percent of
alumni solicited—an average show-
ing among private institutions in
the United States. Some universi-
ties comparable to Washington and
Lee have considerably higher par-
ticipation. Surely one of the main
goals of the Alumni Fund in the
future will be the raising of this
performance.

At the outset of the $2,000,000
Capital Fund Drive, it was envi-
sioned that the Alumni Fund and
the Drive would merge efforts so
there would be no double solicita-
tion of any faction of supporters.
All of us can take considerable
pride in the fine showing of the
capital fund campaign. This pro-
gram is now in its last stages, and
there are only about twenty-five per
cent of the total number of alumni
who have either not yet had an op-
portunity to subscribe to the cam-
paign, or who are still under obli-
_ gation to it as of September 1, 1960.

It would seem, therefore, that
from an overall standpoint, the
Alumni Fund for 1960-61 can be

FALL 1960

A. LINwoop HOLTON
Chairman, Alumni Fund Council

instituted over a seventy-five per
cent sector of the total number.
While the capital campaign is of
utmost importance in terms of
making possible those physical fa-
cilities which are so essential at
Washington and Lee University, it
is equally important that the an-
nual giving pattern be re-establish-
ed, and its vision broadened and
enlarged.

The Alumni Fund Council, the
group charged with the responsi-
bilities of directing the yearly
Alumni Fund by the Alumni Board
of ‘Trustees, assembled in Lexing-
ton for its fall meeting on Octo-
ber 8, 1960. This Council, cogni-
zant of its tremendous responsibil-
ity, Is anxious to reinstate the
Alumni Fund to its former status,

 

and to strive diligently to increase
our participation, and to raise our

sights.

At the direction of the Alumni
Fund Council, the 1960-61 Fund
year will be conducted, with every
effort being made toward getting
into a full and complete campaign
in the next Fund year of 1961-62.
This means that the class and re-
gional agent plan is to be re-estab-
lished to its full strength as early
as possible. On the inside front
cover you will find the listing of
the Class Agents with their ad-
dresses. In the next few months
they will be writing to each one of
their classmates, who is eligible for
solicitation, to emphasize the re-
sponsibility of each to the tasks
ahead for our alma mater. Past ex-
perience has shown that Washing-
ton and Lee men always come for-
ward when the need is shown.

The Council would like to ex-
press deep appreciation to the
Class Agents for their devotion
and loyalty in this service to their
alma mater, and to the alumni
who will share in the necessary
support of the University. Also,
with the sights set for a complete
campaign, the Council has direct-
ed that the Regional Agent plan
be started in the spring of 1961
to assist the class agents in bring-
ing about a full participation of
alumni. The Executive Secretary
is presently engaged in soliciting
these agents who will be announced
in the next issue of the Alumni
Magazine.

First Baker Scholars Arrive on

By JAMEs D. Farrar, ‘49

Director of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships

NE OF THE MOST significant de-
() velopments at Washington
and Lee in many years has been
the establishment of the George F.
Baker Scholarships. As announced
in the Alumni Magazine in Oc-
tober, 1959, Washington and Lee is
one of twelve liberal arts colleges
in the country sharing in the schol-
arship program of the George F.
Baker ‘Trust of New York. The
University received an initial grant
of $50,000 to establish four-year
Baker Scholarships for freshmen en-
tering in 1960, 1961, and 1962.

Alumni response to our request
for assistance in identifying qual1-
fied candidates and _ interesting
them in Washington and Lee was
of extreme value in the selection of
the Baker Scholars for 1960. It was
the hope of the Baker Trust that
members of the college’s Board of
Trustees would play an important
part in the selection of the Baker
Scholars. Members of our Univer-
sity Trustees who served on the
Trustees’ Selection Committee for
Baker Scholars were Joseph L. Lan-
ier, Dr. Huston St. Clair, and
Dr. John N. Thomas, who gave in-
valuable time and care to the final
selection of the four Baker Scholars.

On March 15, 1960, the Faculty
Committee on Scholarships met for
initial consideration of 166 scholar-
ship candidates for September,
1960. From this group of candi-
dates, the Committee selected six-
teen young men, most highly quali-
fied for the Baker Scholarships, to

6

visit Washington and Lee as guests
of the University and to meet with
the Scholarship Committee and the

 

Board of Trustees’ Selection Com-
mittee. These sixteen men arrived
at the University by Friday morn-

Baker Scholar candidates, along with the Trustees’ selection committee are shown above:
front row, KinsEY, Dr. THOMAS, '24, DR. ST. CLAIR, ’22 and Mr. LANIER, °27. Second row,

ing, March 25, and toured the cam-
pus with members of the student
body and met individually for a
fifteen-minute interview with our
Scholarship Committee during the
day. After conclusion of interviews
in the afternoon, the Committee
selected eight of the sixteen candi-
dates as semi-finalists to meet in-
dividually for a twenty-minute in-
terview with the Trustees’ Selection
Committee on Saturday morning,
March 26. From this group of eight,
the Selection Committee was to
name the Baker Scholars for 1960.

Members of the Trustees’ Com-
mittee arrived in Lexington on
Friday evening, March 25, and
spent several hours that night re-
viewing in detail the applications
for admission and scholarship of all
eight semi-finalists. The Committee
started interviews with the candi-
dates at 8:30 Saturday morning and
completed their selection of five
Baker Scholars by 1:00 p.m. that
day.

Four of the five candidates select-
ed accepted the scholarships and
are members of our Freshman Class
this year. Chosen on the bases of
character, intellectual capacity, mo-
tivation and leadership, and finan-
cial need, these four men became
Washington and Lee’s first Baker
Scholars: John W. Baker, Jr., of
Suffolk, Virginia; Matthew H. Hul-
bert of Lynchburg, Virginia;
Thomas C. Lewis of Goldsboro,
North Carolina; and Jimmie T.
Sylvester of Memphis, Tennessee.

Alonzo Atkins, Jr., of Gadsden,

FALL 1960

Alabama; Robert H. Brewer of
Helena, Arkansas; and Bill H. Kin-
sey, Jr., of Washington, North
Carolina were awarded Robert E.
Lee and Alfred I. duPont Scholar-
ships and are members of this year’s
Freshman Class.

Through the George F. Baker
Scholarships and a broadened pro-
eram of student financial aid,
Washington and Lee is assisting

financially more entering students
this year than any other previous
freshman group. Fifty-eight fresh-
men, 18 per cent of a class of 324,
are receiving a total of $53,095 in
financial aid. The University looks
to continuing alumni help in in-
teresting qualified young men in
Washington and Lee—help vital
to our program of Admission and
Scholarship.

Occupational File in the Offing

HETHER you are a doctor, a

lawyer, a parking lot attend-
ant, a salesman, a teacher, or what
have you, the Alumni Association
is interested in recording this data
in the compilation of an occupa-
tional file. This is not a new idea
in the educational arena. Some col-
leges and universities have attempt-
ed, over the years, in various de-
grees to Maintain a system of keep-
ing up-to-date information on the
business and professional life of
their alumni. With the advent of
the new IBM electronic data equip-
ment here at Washington and Lee,
this dream comes into the realm
of a practical reality.

“By their fruits ye shall know
them’’—this philosophy has long
been the byword for colleges and
universities. Every institution is
proud of its product and is keenly
aware of the impact and influence
which her alumni make in all levels
of community life. Washington and
Lee University proudly accepts
these comparisons and we _ are
pleased with the thought that per-
centagewise, our Alma Mater pro-
duces an enviable number _ of
leaders in all phases of economic,
educational, and professional life.

As one travels around the country
and visits alumni chapters, he is
always impressed with the fine con-
tributions which Washington and
Lee men make in their own com-

munities, their churches, and their
businesses. It is becoming increas-
ingly apparent that small, private
institutions are obliged to do a
little better job in the educational
field and produce the exceptional
in order to justify their existence
and the support given them. Each
college must in some way have facts
and figures to prove its case. Wash-
ington and Lee University is anx-
ious to meet this challenge.

With this thought in mind, the
Alumni Association is desirous of
moving toward the establishment
of an occupational file. While the
master cards in the central office
do contain, to a limited degree,
such information it is impossible,
under the present setup, to cate-
gorize the alumni membership.
Within the next several menths a
brochure will be developed which
will explain more thoroughly the
purpose and program for this oc-
cupational listing. Perhaps in the
first quarter of 1961 the alumni will
receive a questionnaire which,
when returned to the central office,
will result in having the informa-
tion transferred to an IBM card.
This will be the beginning of the
Washington and Lee occupational
file. Its continued success and
worth will depend entirely on the
cooperation of each person in keep-
ing us well advised of their present
status and the changes which take
place in the future.

By FRANCIS P. GAINES

Chancellor
Washington and Lee University

VERY CITIZEN who reads a news-
E paper or hears the appro-
priate speech knows what we may
term the quantitative problem of
American education. It is the start-
ling increase in enrollment, or at
least of application, and it exists on
every level. Bravely if sometimes
blunderingly the leadership of our
thinking attacks this problem. It
will be solved with some satisfac-
tion. But meanwhile we must surely
consider more than quantity.

More subtle and possibly more
perilous is the qualitative problem.
This problem, or certainly an im-
portant element of it, may be stat-
ed, oversimplified perhaps, in this
way: A dominant if unconscious
public sentiment demands of the
schools performances that are simp-
ly no part of the school’s business.
This insistent clamor, by the way,
is often in behalf of praiseworthy
motive, supplementing the home
or alumni loyalty or even civil wel-
fare. These divert and even defeat
central purposes.

School Canr’t Replace Home

Careful students of social devel-
opment have observed the slow,

8

A Retired “President Speake:

“Free Us To Teach’’

sometimes subterranean, but steady
tendency to transfer to the school
functions of other traditional agen-
cies. It is true, of course, that any
school should be mindful of group
adjustment, good manners, and the
ancient sweetness of “in honor pre-
ferring one another’’—valid for
many situations besides the mar-
riage ceremony. But by no stretch
of the imagination can we fancy
the school as supplanting the good
home. It is the duty of the schools
to emphasize character and truth
work but the

a rather un-

and honesty of
“school-church” is
thinkable concept.

A curious phase of this sentiment
that completely misunderstands the
work of education, a fact notable
on the secondary level, is an appar-
ently growing practice of “auto-
matic promotion.” This logic as-
sumes that the school is above all
else a place where youth spend a
given number of years, learning
what they may, and passing from
stage to stage without regard to
accomplishment so that they will
get out of the way of others tread-
ing on the heels. In other words,
the school is a kind of community
babysitter for varying necessities.
This idea is treason to every end of
education.

Less conspicuous but now of dis-
turbing proportions is a conviction
of many that contribution of any

school hes in furnishing entertain-
ment for some segment of the peo-
ple, the community or the alumni
or what-have-you. This insistence
has been dramatized in certain re-
sort towns which consider high
school exhibitions a drawing card
for tourists. Some such urgency is
felt strongly on the higher levels.
Various college presidents have told
me that when a proposal to simpli-
fy athletics had been advanced, the
Chamber of Commerce, or an equi-
valent group, moved into immed-
iate action. The reasoning proposed
was of this nature: “Since this city
supports your institution, you are
obligated to give us the most ex-
pert spectacles, in order to draw
huge crowds who will patronize our
business.” “The poor president is at
loss to counter this requisite of
quid pro quo.

Sober consideration, it seems to
me, should disclose how superficial
and how unworthy this kind of
muddled mentality would prove.
For example, we admire and ap-
plaude the Rockettes of the New
York Music Hall, but are we really
prepared to admit that the end of
education for our girls is to provide
for every school unit a charming
galaxy of dancers, even if we pro-
mote them to the title of major-
ette? I recall the hilarity in one
university circle a few years ago
because it had defeated a rival by

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

the single point after touchdown;
and I recall the ironic comment of
an adherent of the other school:
“Let’s drop everything else and go
to educating toes.”

Just Play Mary

Of course outside activities have
their place in education up to grad-
uate or professional work. We re-
call the truth of the maxim, “All
young animals love to play,’ and
thus we encourage sports. We re-
member that fantasy is an instinct
of every imaginative child, and we
provide pageant or dramatics. We
know the urgency for social life.
Some years ago, William and Mary,
a fine co-educational college, gave
us a bad defeat in football, where-
upon one of our students muttered,
“Don’t want to play William any-
way, just want to play Mary.” All
college boys want to “play Mary.”
We wouldn't change that aspiration
if we could.

But the outside world should
grant us the privileges of organizing
these procedures solely for the bene-
fit of the students themselves and
not for the enjoyment of the crowd.
Surely the program of extra-curri-
cular effort can be made profitable
as a part of the strengthening as
well as the enrichment of the young
life.

No Subsidized Athletics

Some of us have learned with
happy surprise that there is an ap-
preciable and influential, though
generally inarticulate, segment of
public sentiment that supports the
commitment of education primarily
to the intellectual culture. Some
years ago the trustees of Washing-
ton and Lee in quiet decision
abandoned every form of subsidized
athletics. When the announcement
was made, it suddenly seemed that
the decision was really earth-shak-
ing. I received more than a thou-
sand letters, and for a period drop-
ped all other duties in a somewhat
futile attempt to make adequate

FALL 1960

reply. Sincere alumni in deep alarm
assured me that we would lose pop-
ular support and would wither on
the vine.

Quite the contrary happened, ap-
plications showed tremendous in-
crease. The alumni fund in about
three years more than doubled. By
the way—and I had not expected
this development—the number of
students who entered intercollegi-
ate sports almost doubled.

After long years of listening to
the clamor of pedagogic voices, I
seem to hear now a dramatic plea
of educators: “Set us free for our
enduring task, the fulfillment of
promise that lies in the minds of
our girls and our boys!” The
schools want to set high standards

and demand compliance. And there
is something in youth that will re-
spond if significance can be made
clear; witness the grueling self-disci-
pline a boy will suffer in order to
make a given team.

Inevitably if this plea be grant-
ed by our sustaining public, we
shall solve not only the qualitative
problem but possibly other phases
of our difficulty. The school, for ex-
ample, that is permitted to enforce
high standards will not have many
delinquents. Girls and boys who
have the ability and the energy and
the certainty of purpose to meet
high standards do not normally
give us worry about attitude, con-
duct, or eventual destiny.

Three Busy “Professors
What They Did Last Summer

Dr. William Pusey, ITI

MONTH-LONG trip to West Ger-

many last summer was the
good fortune of Dr. William Pusey,
III, head of the German depart-
ment, and new Dean of the Col-
lege. His journey, which lasted
from June 12, until July 11, was
described by him as follows:

“TI was one of six American pro-
fessors of German who visited Ger-
many on a month’s study trip as
guests of the West German Govern-
ment. The object of the visit was
to acquaint us with the education-
al and cultural developments of the
past few years in the Federal Re-
public. We had ample opportuni-
ty to talk with university officials
and professors and with members of
cultural agencies in the various
German states.

“It was clear from visiting Ger-
man universities that the major
problem is too many students and
too few professors and instructors.
In Munich, for instance, we attend-
ed a class lecture on nineteenth-
century German literature, which
had an enrollment of about 1,200.
Even seminars, which originally
were designed for the active partic-
ipation of a limited number, now
often draw more than 200 students,
which obviously eliminates any per-
sonal relationship between profes-
sor and student.

“The crowding of the universities
was explained partly as a result of
the general prosperity and partly as
a result of the desire for status,
which has always gone with being
a university student in Germany.
The shortage of faculty was con-
sidered in part the consequence of
the inadequate university training

from 1933 (or 1939) to 1950, and

10

in part the consequence of the lack
of adequate funds for the employ-
ment of more staff. The latter caus-
es were given for the reluctance to
found new universities. Any sug-
gestion of the desirability of intro-
ducing the college system in Ger-
many found little positive response.

“Many universities are showing
growing concern for the welfare of
the student, who traditionally has
been completely on his own. This
is manifested in construction of dor-
mitories in increasing numbers, a
development showing American
influence, and of which the uni-
versity authorities are unusually
proud.

“It would be an exaggeration to
state that Mercedes cars are replac-
ing Volkswagens on the streets and
highways of Germany, but the eco-
nomic miracle shows itself in the
increased number of automobiles
of all sorts, fewer miniature and
three-wheeled cars, and fewer b1-
cycles. German cities look prosper-
ous, and most of the war damage
has vanished. German architects
and contractors build and build.
They must be among the most pros-
perous and most harassed German
citizens of the late 50’s and the early
60's.

“We were impressed with the
active musical life in Germany. We
attended a half-dozen operas, all of
which were completely sold out.
Berg’s Woyzeck in Cologne, Orffs’
Carmina Burana and Wagner’s Die
Walkure in Munich, and Strauss’s
Rosenkavalier in West Berlin were
impressively performed and enthu-
iastically received.

“While in Berlin we drove into
the Russian sector of the city. ‘The
usual account of contrast between
West and East Berlin is essentially

valid. In the East there are still
huge areas which have not been
rebuilt, and there is a general at-
mosphere of poverty and depres-
sion. We saw practically no young
men on the streets there except
the ubiquitous People’s Police. We
also visited a center where refugees
from East Germany are interview-
ed before they are allowed to go to
the Federal Republic. Near Lubeck
we saw the zonal border, with an
uncultivated, eerie strip about 100
yards wide on the eastern side,
guarded by the People’s Police
from a series of watchtowers. A few
cars only, bound, we were told, to
or from Sweden, crossed the border.
It gave one an uneasy feeling, look-
ing across the Iron Curtain in-
to the ‘German Democratic Re-

public’.

Dr. Leonard E. Jarrard

ABY-SITTING doesn’t usually re-
B quire a Doctor of Philosophy
degree, but there were few sitters
who wouldn’t have taken this job
under any circumstances.

The babies were fifty white rats,
and the sitter last summer was Dr.
Leonard E. Jarrard, assistant pro-
fessor of psychology. The rats are
used in the winter by students for
conditioning experiments as part
of an expanded psychology study.

While the students were away,
the professor did stay—with the rats.
In addition to baby-sitting, he also
practiced obstetrics, since he was in
the process of breeding the animals
to obtain more rats for experiment-
al use. Dr. Jarrard was also mak-
ing a preliminary study of the ef-
fects of radiation on operant be-
havior in the rat, under a John M.

@ THE VIRGINIA Division of Mineral
Resources has published a_ thirty-
seven page geological survey book-
let of the Lexington area, written
by Dr. Kenneth F. Bick, assistant
professor of geology. Field work
was done during 1959, and writing
was completed last semester.

The booklet, “Geology of the
Lexington Quadrangle, Virginia,”
is published for distribution to all
Virginia state libraries and most
college libraries in the United
States. Dr. Bick is now doing a sim-
ilar study in the Williamsville
quadrangle in Bath County, Vir-
ginia.

m DR. EDWARD D. MYERS, head of the
department of philosophy, return-
ed during the summer, after a two-
year leave of absence as cultural at-
tache at the American Embassy in
Bonn, Germany.

He praised the “effective job” be-
ing done abroad by the United
States Information Agency (USIA).
Russia, he pointed out, spares
neither money nor effort in infor-
mational activities in West Ger-
many, and sends its top experts to
visit the German universities. How-
ever, Russian propaganda _ efforts
are making little headway in West
Germany, which is, next to the
United States, the most prosperous
country in the world. He added
that a recent survey in Germany
shows that the greater an individ-
ual’s knowledge of American liter-
ature and history, the stronger his
approval of American foreign
policy.

One of Dr. Myers’ projects was
working with German universities
to encourage them to. establish
chairs in American literature.

His success is indicated by the
fact that during his two years there,
eight of the eighteen universities
did establish such chairs. Seven of

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

these chairs will be filled during the
winter semester, three of them with
American professors.

During his two-year appoint-
ment, Dr. Myers gave about seven-
ty-five lectures at universities and
to educational groups. Last sum-
mer, he was a guest professor at
the Free University of Berlin.

 

@ THE FQUITABLE LIFE Assurance
Society of the United States has
made an unrestricted gift of $1,000
to the University, for the fourth
successive year.

Washington and Lee was one of
125  privately-supported colleges
sharing in $125,000 in grants from
the company, in its “Plan for the
Support of Higher Education.”

 

a “THE MYTH of American Mate-

rialism” was the subject in Septem-
ber of Dr. Harry C. Allen, Com-
monwealth Fund professor — of
American history at University Col-
lege, University of London.

The emphasis on money and
materialism in general in Amer-
ican life is due, he opinioned, to
the inability to find any alternative
standard of value by which men can
judge their fellow men. The em-
phasis on materialism, he suggested,
may be an inevitable result of the
democratic form of government,
where the criterion of success is
determined by what a majority of
the people think it should be. This
is in contrast to non-democratic
countries where a small religious
or aristocratic clique imposes a set
of non-materialistic values on the
people.

In the United States, the only
basis for success that the majority
agrees upon is the ability to make

FALL 1960

money, Dr. Allen said. That makes
the problem of materialism most
obvious here because we are the
“oldest practicing democracy in the
world.” In other so-called democa-
cies, he pointed out, a small aristo-
cratic group continues to determine
standards of success, and the full
impact of democracy has been ob-
scured.

w# “HUMANISM, the Ancient Ideal
and Its Survival’’ was the topic of
Dr. Moses Hadas, Jay professor of
Greek at Columbia University, as
he conducted the thirty-fifth Sem-
inar in Literature on October 81.

Dr. Hadas is currently making a
nationwide lecture tour. A member
of the Columbia faculty for thirty
years, and head of its classics de-
partment, he is the author of nine
books, including, “The Homeric
Gods,” “Basic Words of Cicero,”
and “The Greek Poets.” He is a
former rabbi, German scholar, and
OSS agent, and was described by
Newsweek as “that rare phenome-
non—the great teacher.”

 

@ THE UNIVERSITY played host Oc-
tober 21-23 to about goo mothers,
fathers, and guardians of students
for its sixth annual Parents’ Week-
end.

On the agenda were conferences
with faculty members, guided tours,
a buffet luncheon, the football
game between the Generals and
Johns Hopkins, and a Glee Club
concert. ‘The annual “Report to
Parents” by University and student
body officials was a highlight, in-
cluding reports from Dr. William
W. Pusey, Dean of the College; Dr.
Lewis W. Adams, Dean of the
School of Commerce and Business
Administration; Professor Charles
P. Light, Dean of the School of
Law; Frank J. Gilliam, Dean of Stu-
dents and Director of Admissions;
R. Kent Frazier, student body presi-

dent; and Dr. Fred C. Cole, presi-
dent of Washington and Lee.

A Seminar was held on Friday
night, with the participation by
five faculty members. Professor O.
W. Riegel and Dr. Ollinger Cren-
shaw debated “Political Campaign-
ing—Then and Now;” and Dr. E.
D. Myers and Dr. Marshall Fish-
wick discussed “Educational Per-
spectives at Home and Abroad.”
Dr. Marion Junkin was the fifth
faculty member on the program,
giving an art demonstration.

The 56-member Parents’ Advis-
ory Council met during the week-
end, with L. P. Nelson, Jr., of Cul-
peper, presiding. Richard T. Ed-
wards, ’33, Roanoke, was named to
succeed him.

# AFTER TWENTY-FIVE years on the
job, Mrs. William Cabell Flournoy
has retired from her position as
U.D.C. representative at Lee Chap-
el. During that quarter of a cen-
tury, she has led thousands of visi-
tors through the Chapel, explaining

 

Mrs. W. C. FLOURNOY

13

to them the historical significance
of the Lee memorabilia.

Mrs. Flournoy, who is the mother
of Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy, profes-
sor of English, is the author of, “Es-
says,’ published in 1928; ‘“Side-
lights on Southern History,” pub-
lished in 1939; and “Essays on
American History,” published in
1956. Her essay on “Twin Patriots—
Washington and Lee’’ was published
separately in paperback form.

Miss Mary E. Hamilton, a teach-
er at Lexington High School for 28
years, succeeds Mrs. Flournoy as
representative of the Virginia Di-
vision, United Daughters of the
Confederacy, at the chapel.

In addition to Miss Hamilton,
two other hostesses, Mrs. R. L.
Owen and Mrs. R. P. Cooke, are
employed by the University at the
chapel.

m™ A GROUP OF paintings on loan
from the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum in New York is on display
this semester in Evans dining hall,
in the east parlor.

The collection includes paintings
of Paul Klee, Albert Gleizes, Harry
Bertoia, Wassily Kandinsky, and
others, and is one of fifteen sent out
to American colleges and univer-
sities by the museum.

The art displays were begun here
last year in the dining hall in an
effort to acquaint the whole stu-
dent body with art.

NEW INTERNATIONAL Business Ma-
chine processing equipment was in-
stalled at Washington and Lee in
September, and went right to work
to help in registration procedures.

There are six machines, each per-
forming a different function, ac-
cording to J. Baine Fox, the new
supervisor of statistical records, and
the man in charge of the machines.
Leased from the I.B.M. company,
the machines have been added to
University operations to increase
clerical efficiency and _ accuracy,
President Cole said.

14

‘They were used initially for stu-
dent registration, but will gradually
be applied to other administrative
functions. Registration was chosen
first, because it 1s a repetitive pro-
cess and a good test for the new
equipment.

Information concerning students’
ages, Classes, grades, sections, home
addresses, parents’ names, and other
such facts were recorded on special-
ly prepared cards for the IBM ma-
chines. ‘The machines in turn, in-
terpreted the information on the
cards and then produced the data
on forms for use by the adminis-
trative officers, faculty, and stu-
dents.

Plans call for application of the
machines to records now used by
the Alumni Office, and the Develop-
ment Office at Washington Lee.
Special reports may also be _ pra-
pared by the machines in the fu-
ture. Flexibility of the equipment
allows for such additional work re-
quirements, Mr. Fox says.

@ THREE YEARS AGO, only a hand-
ful of boys were present for Lee
McLaughlin’s first football practice
and the Generals ended the season

with a 0-8-0 record.

‘This September, 44 men were out
for the first practice session and the
Generals stand 6-0-1 in seven of
nine starts.

This marked change is evidence
of the jelling of McLaughlin’s hope
and work since he became head
football coach in 1957.

Some “beating of the bushes” in
recruiting and “a little encourage-
ment” plus the chance for anyone
to play have led the Generals out
of a “hapless” situation to a nearly
undefeated season.

Juniors form the nucleus of Mc-
Laughlin’s three-deep team. Sturdy,
dependable seniors and_ eager
sophomores round out the squad.

McLaughlin, with the backing of
assistant coaches Buck Leslie and
Boyd Williams, has traveled to
many different areas in an effort to
encourage high school seniors who
can meet and maintain W&L’s aca-
demic requirements

With reasonable academic assur-
ance McLaughlin then depends on
his theory that every man should
have a chance to play. This adds
to team confidence and each player
feels that every other man on the
team makes a contribution.

The conservative but confident
Generals opened their 1960 season
against Centre College and walked
away with a 21-6 victory. They fol-
lowed up their winning pattern the
next week by downing Dickinson,
23-0.

Franklin and Marshall took a
severe 38-8 beating from the Gen-
erals in the second home game. A
quick trip to Ashland gave the
squad a 26-3 victory over Ran-
dolph-Macon College.

‘The only smudge on the season’s
record to date is an 8-8 draw with

FALL 1960

Johns Hopkins University. In a
display of team effort, the Generals
beat favored Hampden-Sydney,
14-7, and then blanked Carnegie
‘Tech 6-0 for the first shutout since
1953:

An example of McLaughlin’s
willingness to let any interested
boy play is Terry Fohs, W&L’s
strong contender for Little All-
American honors. This Baltimore,
Maryland, junior who weighs a
light 145 pounds would be too
small to serve as linebacker on
most college squads but he’s a key
man for the Generals. He was
named the roughest player last year
and is leading the team in tackles
this year.

A good crop of 32 freshmen will
be contributing to next year’s sea-

son. The freshmen closed out their
season with a 3-3 record—losing the
three games by a total of five points.
Standout performers were quarter-
back Jim McDaniel and _ halfbacks
Henry Sackett and James Yoffe.
They were coachedby law student
Hal Bates, former William and
Mary end.

The Generals have not gone
without injuries this season. Sen-
lor left halfback Bobby Funkhous-
er was sidelined in late October
with a kidney ailment. Skipper
Smith, starting left half sophomore,
dropped out with a recurrence of
an old high school head injury.
Junior end Rosewell Page was
knocked out of season play when
he broke his ankle in the opening
game against Centre.

 

Left halfback Boppy FUNKHOUSER meets some opposition in a run during the Washington
and Lee-Franklin and Marshall tilt on Saturday, October 8, on Wilson Field. The Generals
downed the Diplomats handily with a score of 38-8. Until he was sidelined two weeks ago,
he led the team in rushing. Bobby, a senior, was lost to the team with a kidney ailment.

Homecoming at ¥.

HE RAINS CAME, but so did the Washington and

Lee faithful, to the 1960 Homecoming weekend,
October 7-8. On the schedule were: a pep rally,
an alumni coffee hour at Evans Dining Hall; a noon
alumni luncheon at Evans Hall; the thrilling foot-
ball game between the Generals and the Diplomats
from Franklin and Marshall; the crowning of the
Homecoming queen; and the reception after the
game for alumni and their families at the Robert
E. Lee Hotel. Phi Gamma Delta won the Alumni
Association prize for the best frat house display, but
the Delta Tau Deltas, traditional winners, came up
with a good idea which took third place, behind
Sigma Phi Epsilon. And to make the day a bright
one—in spite of the showers—the Generals beat Frank-
lin and Marshall, 38 to 8.

than half a million dollars being donated during the
past year to a group of twelve institutions of higher
learning.

These colleges, members of the Virginia Founda-
tion for Independent Colleges, were recipients of
$574,000 from 517 corporations and businessmen in a
cooperative fund-raising enterprise.

In seven years since the Foundation was organized,
with Dr. Francis P. Gaines as its first president, Wash-
ington and Lee has received more than $200,000 for
current operations. And benefits to the University
and to other affiliated institutions have substantially
increased each year—this year’s funds represent a
twenty-seven per cent increase over those of the pre-
vious year.

The $574,000 which business invested the past
year in twelve bluechip growth securities, Virginia’s
independent colleges, is the equivalent of nearly fifteen
per cent of the aggregate faculty payrolls.

‘The contributions of Virginia business and indus-
try are not only a source of valuable financial assist-
ance to Washington and Lee and the eleven other
privately-supported colleges in the Virginia Founda-
tion for Independent Colleges but they represent an
attitude that I feel is very significant for the future of
these institutions,” said President Fred C. Cole. ‘““The
interest shown in higher education reflects an aware-
ness that business and industry rely heavily upon col-
leges and universities for highly-qualified young men
and women to fill responsible positions for them in
the future. We must consider their support a challenge
to perform our work in privately-supported higher ed-
ucation in a superior way. The measure of excellence
we achieve at Washington and Lee will express the
appreciation of this University for the support given
us.”

Generosity of Virginia industries brought this tri-
bute from Dr. Willis M. Tate, president of Southern
Methodist University, and chairman of the Indepen-
dent College Funds of America, Incorporated:

“In proportion to the corporate assets and earn-
ings in the various states, Virginia business ranks first

20

in voluntary financial support of its group of private
colleges... The independent colleges of Virginia are
respected throughout the land for their historic em-
phasis upon quality. Likewise your Virginia business
community is gaining the admiration of educators
across the nation for supporting these institutions.”’

The roster of business and professional leaders
who serve the VFIC and who actively solicit funds
reads like a Who’s Who of business executives in Vir-
ginia. Their reasons for assisting the Foundation add
up to a conviction that corporations must help if in-
dependent higher education is to thrive.

For instance, the president of the Commonwealth
Natural Gas Corporation, William H. Trapnell, said:

“The survival of private colleges is almost essen-
tial to the nation. The prospect of the federal govern-
ment getting into higher education is ominous. And if
private colleges can’t be saved by voluntary action, the
federal government will step in.”

Edwin Hyde, president of Miller and Rhodes, Rich-
mond, declared, “We support the state colleges by pay-
ing taxes. This foundation is one way to help the in-
dependent colleges. The basic interest most of us have
is in helping them get faculty salaries up to a level
where they can compete with state-supported colleges.”

Stuart T. Saunders, president of the Norfolk and
Western Railway, and chairman of the VFIC, has
said that it is only common sense for businessmen to
help private colleges.

“The proper maintenance of private educational
enterprise must take its place alongside the mainten-
ance of plant, equipment, personnel and markets as
an integral item in the corporation’s annual operat-
ing budget,” he asserted.

In seven years, businessmen have given $2,315,000
to benefit the twelve members of the VFIC, thus dem-
onstrating their confidence in the essentiality of inde-
pendent colleges.

‘The Foundation is governed by a Board of Trus-
tees, including twenty-four businessmen and_ twelve
college presidents. In addition to President Fred C.
Cole, Washington and Lee is represented on the Board
by Chancellor Gaines, James R. Caskie, ’06, and Dr.
Huston St. Clair, 22.

Glenn grant-in-aid and a_ study
from the Virginia Academy of
Science.

‘The rats are used in classroom
experiments to determine certain
behaviorial patterns under varied
conditions. A $1,200 Operant
Condition Machine, installed last
year, is the primary equipment used
with the rats. It measures their re-
actions under different conditions.
The machine is designed to cause
the rat to work for his food by
pressing a bar, following certain
kinds of stimulation.

Dr. Charles W. Turner

PIONEER South American study
A tour, sponsored by the Nation-
al Student Association, was headed
last summer by Dr. Charles W.
Turner, professor of history, as one
of its two leaders. Twelve students,
representing a number of American
universities, were successful in com-
petition for places on the tour,
which included stops in the capi-
tals of Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uru-
guay, and Brazil, with side trips in-
to the surrounding areas. Dual pur-
poses of the trip were to hold a sem-
inar for the group and to meet stu-
dent leaders on various college
campuses.

Dr. ‘Turner’s story of the trip is
as follows:

The forty-day trip began last
June, when the group boarded a
plane in Miami, with the first stop
Lima, Peru. Members of the party
were placed in private homes for
the twelve-day visit.

The U.S. embassies were ex-
tremely helpful in securing housing
for the students and arranging a
varied program in each country.
For example, Joe Sconce, ’52, in
charge of the planning division of
Point 4 in Rio, was glad to discuss
his work with the group.

Addresses were given by the lead-
ers of the countries, while govern-

FALL 1960

mental and school officials were
glad to give the travelers time to ask
questions and discuss the work.
The group went to see the Inca
areas of Cuzco and Macchu Pichu.
In Santiago, Chile, the students
were asked to observe a student
election procedure at the Law
school of the University of Chile.
Here, they were interested in the
fact that the same parties were
campaigning as would be found in
a national election. Also, in the
same city, the Catholic University
entertained them for a day and
were proud to show one of their
own slum clearance projects. The
Chileans were found to be particu-
larly hospitable and expressed ap-
preciation again and again for the
U.S. aid sent them after they had
suffered the series of earthquakes
last spring.

In Buenos Aires and Montevideo,
the program was quite similar, see-
ing historic places, holding dis-
cussions with President Frondizi of
the University of B.A., visiting some
gauchos on an estancia, and ending

with a boat trip up the Tigres river.

Sao Paulo proved to be a fast-
growing city with colorful sky-
scrapers, and the busy port of San-
tos close by. Between the two points
is a large industrial development
where cars of various makes are
manufactured, as well as many oth-
er products. The Copacabana
Beach in Rio was enjoyed by the
students, who also visited Petropol
is, certain art museums and the gov-
ernment buildings.

The last stop was a must for the
group, the new capital, Brasilia,
where some fifty-thousand people
are busy building the city, amidst
the red dust. The buildings are of
the most modern design. The Bra-
zileans showed the group every
kindness and appeared to be glad to
speak freely of their life and prob-
lems.

The National Student Associa-
tion hopes to make the tour a reg-
ular part of its program. Perhaps
some students of Washington and
Lee will be able to take part in
future years.

Have You Lost Your “Calyx’’?

ROM TIME TO TIME, alumni express regret that they have misplaced
I or lost their respective yearbooks, and wish that they might obtain

another.

After some research, the Alumni Association, in cooperation with
the Publications Board and particularly the management of the Calyx, an-
nounces that there are some copies of past yearbooks still available at the

University.

These will be distributed on a “first come, first serve” basis. The price
Is $2.50 each, which includes packaging and postage charges. Please send
your orders to the Alumni Office, P.O. Box 897, Lexington, and make
your checks payable to the order of the Washington and Lee Calyx.

Letter for Some Cfall A}ternoon

Department of English
October, Any Year
Dear Coach Musselman:

Remembering our discussion of your football men who are having
troubles in English, I decided to ask you, in turn, for help.

We feel that Paul Spindles, one of our most promising scholars, has a
chance for a Rhodes Scholarship, which would be a great thing for him and
for our college. Paul has the academic record for this award, but we find
that the aspirant is also required to have other excellences, and ideally
should have a good record in athletics. Paul is weak. He tries hard, but he
has troubles in athletics. But he does try hard.

We propose that you give special consideration to Paul as a varsity
player, putting him, if possible, in the backfield of the football team. In
this way we can show a better college record to the committee deciding on
the Rhodes Scholarships. We realize that Paul will be a problem on the
field, but—as you have often said—cooperation between our department and
yours is highly desirable, and we do expect Paul to try hard, of course.
During the intervals of study we shall coach him as much as we can. His
work in English Club and on the debate team will force him to miss
many practices, but we intend to see that he carries an old football around
to bounce (or whatever one does with a football) during intervals in his
work. We expect Paul to show entire good will in his work for you, and
though he will not be able to begin football practice till late in the season,
he will finish with good attendance.

@Plass Reunions

Anniversary Classes ‘To Meet

HE FIRST WEEKEND in May has
been set as the date for the an-
nual Anniversary Class Reunions.
Once again classmates will return
to the campus for fun and frolic as
well as to reminisce about the good
ole days. There will be an oppor-
tunity to visit familiar places in and
around Lexington, to talk with stu-
dents and compare notes with yes-
teryear, to participate in discus-
sions on the state of the University
by administrative officials, to join
in individual class banquets, and
to enjoy the companionship of close
friends.

These anniversary class reunions
are becoming increasingly more
important, not only to the Univer-
sity, but to the overall understand-
ing of the alumni. It is here that
the alumni are brought up-to-date
on all aspects of their Alma Mater,
and they invariably grasp a more
solid concept of her prestige and
prominence in the national pic-
ture. Plans are underway to obtain
a speaker of national prominence
for this occasion.

The Executive Secretary indicates
that a new feature this year will be
the advance registration listing.
Every effort will be made to advise
the anniversary classes of those
members who expect to return for
this gala occasion.

Therefore, members of the classes
of 1911, 1921, 1936, and 1951 who
hope to attend the reunions next
spring are asked to complete the
simple form contained on this page.
This will be merely an expression
of intent and, of course, will not be
considered as a actual reservation
request. ‘That will come later. It
will, however, serve as the basis for

FALL 1960

a listing which can be circulated
among the classes.

A Reunion chairman for each of
the anniversary classes has been
named. In some cases, the chairman
is also the Alumni Class Agent. A
committee of these chairmen is
presently hard at work to provide
a larger and more interesting pro-
gram. If you have any suggestions

along this line they will be gladly
received.

‘The University campus is in its
brightest colors in the spring and
the entire community of Lexington
extends a warm welcome to the re-

unioning classes. Lets make _ this
the biggest and best year yet! Write
your classmates and urge them all
to “come on the run in ’61”’!

 

 

This reunion luncheon last year is typical of the good times in store in ’6r.
