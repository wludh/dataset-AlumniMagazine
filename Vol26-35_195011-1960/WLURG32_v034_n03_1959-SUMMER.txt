R. FRED CARRINGTON COLE, aCa-

demic vice-president of Tulane
University, has been named eigh-
teenth president of Washington
and Lee University.

He will succeed Dr. Francis P.
Gaines about September 1. Dr.
Gaines will continue with the uni-
versity in another capacity, details
of which have not yet been an-
nounced.

The president-elect, a soft-spoken
‘Texan who is a scholar of Southern
history, is 47 years old. He and his
wife, Lois, are the parents of four
children: Caroline, 20, a student at
Sophie Newcomb college, the wo-
man’s division of Tulane Univer-
sity; Fred Carrington, Jr., 16; Rob-
ert Grey, 14; and Taylor Morris, 6.

As a boy Dr. Cole lived on a cat-
tle ranch at Duck Creek, just out-

2

side Franklin, Texas. During his
youth, he and his four brothers
worked as saddle hands on_ the
11,000-acre ranch. “I grew up work-
ing on a horse,” he said, “‘and I still
like exercise.”

Dr. Cole will bring to Washing-
ton and Lee a distinguished aca-
demic career. He received from
Louisiana State his A.B. degree in
1934, his A.M. in 1936 and his Ph.D.
in 1941.

From 1936 to 1941 he was re-
search assistant and editorial as-
sociate for the Journal of Southern
History at Louisiana State, becom-
ing managing editor in 1941-42. He
was co-editor of the Southern Biog-
raphy Series, 1938-45, and history
editor of the Louisiana State Uni-
versity Press in 1938-42.

From 1946-53 he was associate

Dr. Fred C. Cole

Is Named

New President

editor of the Mississippi Valley
Historical Review.
Dr. Cole joined the Tulane

University faculty in 1946 as an
associate professor of history. The
following year he was made full
professor and assumed the position
of dean of the college of arts and
sciences, a post he held until 1954
when he was named academic vice-
president at the university.

During World War II he served
in the naval reserve as a gunnery
officer with the rank of junior
grade lieutenant. He was in charge
of revision of the manual of the
medical department of the Navy,
for which he received a special com-
mendation from the Navy in 1945.

During 1945 and 1946, he was
editor and historian of the Army
Air Force Journal.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

Dr. Cole has also been active in
various other educational pursuits,
serving as chairman of the advisory
committee on foreign affairs of the
Southern Regional Educational
Board, and chairman of the South-
ern section of the faculty fellow-
ship program of the Fund for the
Advancement of Education.

He is a director on the board of
the Ford Motor Company’s scholar-
ship program and in 1954-55 was on
leave from Tulane to serve on the
advisory staff of the Ford Founda-
tion in New York.

Dr. Cole is author of ‘“Interna-
tional Relations in Institutions of
Higher Learning in the South,” a
book published in 1958 by the
American Council of Education.

James R. Caskie, ’06, rector, said,
“The board feels very fortunate in
obtaining Dr. Cole as our next pres-
ident. He is a man of highest char-
acter and standing.”

Dr. Cole and his wife were visi-
tors here July 9-3, as guests of Dr.
and Mrs. Gaines. President-elect
Cole said prior to this, he had not
been on the campus for some years.
His last trip here was to attend a
history meeting.

‘The college impressed me then,
and I have always been interested
in Washington and Lee’s tradition
and historical background,” he as-
serted. “I’ve known Dr. Gaines for
many years and I fully understand
the tremendous heritage I have be-
fore me.”

Dr. Cole is a member of the
Southern, American, and Mississip-
pi Valley Historical Associations;
the American Political Science As-
sociation; the Academy of Political
Science; International House; Phi
Beta Kappa; Sigma Chi social fra-
ternity; Phi Kappa Phi; Pi Sigma
Alpha; and Omicron Delta Kappa.

“Who’s Who in America’ lists
him as a Democrat. He is a Baptist,

and his wife and children are
Presbyterians.

PRESIDENT GAINES is shown as he made his last campus address—at the dedication on June 13, 1959 of the Evans dining hall, visible
directly behind, and two new dormitories, Davis and Baker Halls, to the right. On the platform with him, as he bade good-bye to
friends at the Reunion of all alumni, were left to right, the Rev. T. V. BArrert, rector of Robert E. Lee Memorial Church; JAMEs
R. CASKIE, rector of the board of trustees; FRANK J. GILLIAM, dean of students; and JAMES W. WHITEHEAD, director of university relations.

Au Revoir, Dr. Gaines

ONORS GALORE have come
H throughout the years to
Washington and Lee’s president,
Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines. He
has been _ presented
awards, citations, and _ accolades,
and has been lauded by persons in
high places and low.

But these honors, — pleasant
though they may have been, do
not reflect the true measure of the
man. The real awards for his edu-
cational leadership over the de-
cades are found not on medals, in-
scribed on parchment, or engraved
in silver—they are imbedded deep
in the hearts of those who have felt
his impact. For he is described as

numerous

4

the man who “bears the indelible
stamp of a leader, safe to follow
at all times and under all circum-
stances.”

When he was inaugurated in
1930, he declared the power of a
university is to “deposit in the life
of the boy something a little finer
than culture, a little rarer than
competence, a little nobler than
success.” He has believed that in
an uncertain future, the best insur-
ance is “to make big people—big in
the sense of judgment, perspective
and attitude towards others—and
that this can best be done through
education. Education affords the
experiences out of which comes

strength of person, such as the dis-
cipline of self and the acceptance
of responsibility.”” This, then, has
been his credo at Washington and
Lee.

Dean of all Virginia college pres-
idents, Dr. Gaines has served Wash-
ington and Lee for twenty-nine
years. His tenure is second longest
recorded of the seventeen men who
have been president or acting pres-
ident of the institution since its
incorporation in 1782. George Ad-
dison Baxter, president from 1799
tll 1829, served one year longer.
George Washington Custis Lee,
who succeeded his father, General
Lee, to the presidency in 1871,

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

served here for twenty-six years.

Retirement for Dr. Gaines will
not mean moving from the Lex-
ington scene. He and Mrs. Gaines
will continue to make their home
in the area—at their country place,
“Penrobin,” during the
months, and at a small house in
town in winter.

During President Gaines’ admin-
istration, the University has con-
ferred degrees upon 5,169 persons,
including 108 honorary doctorates,
894 law degrees, and 61 masters’
degrees. When he assumed office in
1930, the university’s assets totaled
$3,290,000. When he retires in Sep-
tember, the assets will have in-
creased to more than $16,000,000.
Endowment income’ in _— 1930
amounted to $6,500. Next year, the
college will give out $125,000 in
academic scholarships alone.

Warm

The faculty has greatly benefitted
from Dr. Gaines’ tenure, and has
steadily improved its financial sit-
uation. Since World War II alone,
salaries have been increased 13
times.

While increasing the remunera-
tion for the faculty, the college has
also been increasing the quality of
its teachers. In a recent poll of the
nation’s top educational institu-
tions Washington and Lee ranked
among the top ten men’s colleges
in the United States. Among schools
of comparable size and _ general
academic character, only one could
list more recipients of Ph.D. de-
grees among its faculty.

President Gaines has won wide
acclaim throughout the United
States as an orator. In past years,
he used to receive about 400 invi-
tations per year to speak, but
usually was able, because of the
press of duties, to accept only about
forty of those. Wherever he has
appeared, however, he has been
praised. Indeed, after one appear-
ance in Mississippi about thirteen
years ago, the Jackson Daily News
declared editorially, “This dis-
tinguished Southerner ...is easily

SUMMER 1959

the greatest educator-statesman this
nation has produced since Wood-
row Wilson. Like Woodrow Wil-
son, he is a complete master of
simple Saxon speech. Unlike the
great World War I president, how-
ever, he has never sought, and per-
haps never will seek political hon-
ors, but he is nevertheless ‘a school-
master in politics’ who has a head
chockfull of wisdom, whose think-
ing is on an even keel, whose intel-
lect is clear and penetrating. He
could worthily fill the greatest of-
fice within gift of the American
people.”

In 1946, Dr. Gaines was boosted
by a Richmond newspaper as “a
logical candidate” to go to Wash-
ington to fill the remainder of the
late U.S. Senator Carter Glass’ un-
expired term of three years. How-
ever, he quickly removed himself
from consideration, declaring he
could not possibly leave the cam-

pus.

His sense of duty to the Uni-
versity has been manifested in
many ways. Even when he offered
his resignation in August, 1958, he
said he felt that he owed Wash-

ington and Lee one more year of
effort, particularly in view of the
$2,000,000 campaign tor new sci-
ence and journalism facilities. And,
as many alumni know, he _ has
traveled far and wide in America to
campaign for the drive. His elo-
quence during the campaign has
insured for his college success to-
ward that goal which has _ been
sought.

Fourteen honorary degrees have
been conferred upon him by other
colleges and universities, including
Columbia University, Duke Unz1-
versity, Baylor University, Furman
University, University of Chatta-
nooga, University of North Caro-
lina, Hampden-Sydney College,
Mercer University, University of
Richmond, Wake Forest College,
William Jewell College, Waynes-
burg College, University of the
South, and Rollins College.

Because of his successful admin-
istration at Washington and Lee,
he has also been sought after to
head other colleges and universi-
ties. However, he chose to remain
at Washington and Lee. John

This is where PRESIDENT GAINES likes to be—in the midst of friends, telling tales, swap-
ping jokes, ever bringing the conversation back to his beloved Washington and Lee.

HE WEATHER Was warm and per-
fect, the backslapping and
handshaking unceasing, as old and
young grads and families got to-
gether during the Reunion of all
classes June 11, 12, and 13, in Lex-
ington.

No Fancy Dress or Finals week-
end brought any more activity for
the alumni, as they jogged from re-
ceptions to luncheons, from meet-
ings to a dance, and banquet, and
all the while, renewing friendships
with classmates. It was a pace which
would have swamped undergradu-
ates, but the alumni took to it like
ducks to the Nile.

There were 315 alumni who
signed the register and including
wives, family members and guests
there were over 750 visitors on cam-
pus. The anniversary classes were
represented thusly: 1909: 18; 1919,
11; 1934, 35. Alumni were present
from as far away as California. One
alumnus came all the way from
Mexico, where he was vacationing.

6

This congenial group of alumni and wives got together on June rz in front of the registration tent.

Social activities included ban-
quets for the anniversary classes, a
social hour with Lexington alumni
as hosts, night entertainment on the
campus, a reception honoring Pres-
ident and Mrs. Gaines, a luncheon
on campus, a dance in Doremus
gymnasium, and a special reception
for law alumni. In addition, alum-
ni wives were entertained at a tea
given by Mrs. Leon Sensabaugh,
wife of the Dean.

Educational aspects included an
address by Stuart Saunders, presi-
dent of the Norfolk and Western
Railway, on the role of the alumni
in preserving the liberal arts col-
lege; a talk on “A New Look at An
Old World,” by physics professor
Dr. E. F. ‘Turner, Jr.; and a report
on the university by four deans of
the school.

matters included a
general alumni business meeting,
and meetings by University board
of trustees and Alumni board of
trustees.

The Reunion was closed on Sat-
urday, June 13, after the new Evans
dining hall, and Davis and Baker
dormitories were dedicated, and
James W. Whitehead, director of
relations, outlined a
“futurama” report. President Fran-
cis P. Gaines made his farewell ad-
dress, as alumni cheered and gave
him a standing ovation.

The Alumni Secretary Reports

Highlights of the Year

By WILLIAM CG. WASHBURN, 40

N THIS MY FIRST report as your

Alumni Secretary, I should like
to review briefly some of the high-
lights of the year.

Of course I shall never forget
this time last June when Cy Young
gave his final report upon his retire-
ment, and then there followed
shortly afterwards, in the early sum-
mer, the announcement by Dr.
Gaines of his coming retirement.
Needless to say, both of these events
are firmly stamped in my memory
and both have had their impact.
During the tenure of these men,
they have witnessed the spectacular
growth of the Alumni Association.
It has truly been a challenge to fol-
low in their footsteps and I’ve en-
joyed it immensely.

Spirit Progressive

From my observation this year
it is evident that the spirit and in-
terest of Washington and Lee
alumni everywhere are continuing
in their progressive stride. Last
June, Jim Whitehead, our Direct-
or of University Relations, was in-
‘troduced to you. Under his tute-
lage and with the tireless efforts of
Dr. Gaines, the University Develop-
ment Program has gotten out of the
blue print stage and off the ground
and is now in full swing. I’m sure

12

all of you know, by now, the aim of
the University Development Pro-
gram. Since January of this year I
have, together with this develop-
ment team, been to 17 of the 44
campaign areas. From Washington
to Jacksonville, from Norfolk to
Louisville, from Philadelphia to
San Antonio. In addition to this
I have participated in meetings of
seven other chapters, making a to-
tal of 24 chapters I have been privi-
leged to visit this year. Before com-
pletion of the first stage of the De-
velopment Campaign sometime
next fall, I hope to have been to all
38 of our present chapters. Just last
month Dr. Gaines and I went to
Hagerstown, Maryland, for the in-
stallation or reactivation of our
thirty-eighth chapter—the Cumber-
land Valley Chapter. This is the
first addition to our ranks in a num-
ber of years. I know you join me in
welcoming them to our association.
Every chapter has had at least one
or two meetings and some have had
several, many of which were at-
tended by representatives from the
college. In every case we have been
so pleased to see how enthusiasti-
cally and eagerly Washington and
Lee men unite their numbers for
the common benefit of the Univer-
sity as well as for good fellowship.
It has been most inspiring to me.
There are still some areas that need

revitalizing and perhaps some
places where a new chapter needs
to be established. ‘To this purpose

I pledge my full energy.

Alumni Contributions

As many of you know, this
year’s 1958-59 Alumni Fund was
merged with that of the Univer-
sity Development Program. ‘This
merger will remain in effect until
all 44 areas have had their cam-
paigns so as not to have double
exposure solicitations. Actually
then there is no report I can make
of the Fund, as such. However, I
would like to advise that with only
those areas which have been cov-
ered approximately 1400 alumni
have contributed over $500,000 to
the Development Program. This is
an excellent showing and the As-
sociation should be well pleased.
You'll remember our last report
of the Alumni Fund indicated a
participation of about 36% of our
members. When this Development
Program is complete, I think we
will perhaps find we have a much
higher participation. One of the
most universal themes today is that
a college cannot expect support
from outside sources without first
demonstrating a strong support
within its own rank and file. This
is the one goal for which we must
all strive.

Surely I want to thank all chap-
ter officers, alumni workers, cap-
tains and team members for their
support in this fine share that
alumni have furnished the Devel-
opment Program. It is a source of
great encouragement to me and we
are indebted to you for your co-
operation.

Due to the merger of the Funds

this year the role of Regional and

Class Agents was somewhat divert-
ed. ‘Though there was no solicita-
tion on the part of the Fund, as
such, we did maintain our class
agent roster. ‘These dedicated men
were of immeasureable help in or-

ganizing and prompting this very
Reunion today. They corresponded
with each and every classmate and
provided the cementing mortar so
necessary to our organization. | am
profoundly grateful to each and
every one.

The Magazine

Probably the widest channel of
communication between alumni
themselves and between the alum-
nus and the University, is our
Alumni Magazine. Ym sure you
feel, as I do, that we have a most
attractive publication. We _ have
tried to keep you abreast of news
of the University and of your fel-
low alumni. Our audience today is
now some 10,200 of which some
115 are overseas. Credit for the
magazine goes to our very able edi-
tor, Mrs. Robert Jeffrey, and to the
Superintendent of the Journalism
Laboratory Press, Mr. C. Harold
Lauck, whose interest and coopera-
tive spirit is unequalled.

Homecoming

I am sure I could comment at
some length on other activities

SUMMER 1959

 

 

BEN W. Dirto, °43, is new vice-president,
chosen in. June. He is a former treasurer.

such as our Student-Alumni Rela-
tions Program, Homecoming, our
banquet for the Seniors each year,
and other items that make up our
daily office routine. ‘These phases
grow increasingly important each
year and we are not minimizing or
neglecting them in this report.
However, I should like to mention
only one word here—and_ that
about our Homecoming last No-
vember. We had a splendid occas-
ion, the largest attendance in a
number of years. Several of Cy
Young’s former teammates and sev-
eral athletes whom he had coached
were invited for a ceremony in
honor of Cy’s being named to the
National Football Hall of Fame.
The response and spirit ran high.
It was indeed a highlight of the

year.
* * *

Before closing this report I
should like to pay a debt of thanks
to many people for their help in
this my first year.

First of all let me congratulate
you upon the officers and directors
of your Association. President Dave
Johnson has been most patient
with me, giving unselfishly of his

time and talents. He and your
Directors have made many. sacri-
fices and have done a magnificent
job. I wish to thank also the Unt-
versity Administration officers and
faculty for their wonderful coopera-
tion. I am eternally indebted to
the alumni-faculty committee with-
out whom this General Reunion
1959 could not have taken place.
To Jim Whitehead, the Develop-
ment Office, to the Class Agents, to
Chapter Officers—in short to each
and every alumnus, I am forever
grateful for their tireless efforts,
generous cooperation and devoted
loyalty.

As for my office staff, I can only
say that these three dear ladies have
a special place in my heart. I appre-
ciate their guidance, their enthu-
siasm and help more than I can
ever express. Especially to my good
wife do I owe a special word of
gratitude for all her understand-
ing.

In closing, let me add I have en-
joyed to the fullest extent this first
year and am looking forward with
anticipation to this coming year.

Alumni President Traces History

ONSCIOUS OF THE STRONG prob-
C ability that few alumni had
any information about the forma-
tion of the Washington and Lee
Alumni Association, or of its ob-
jects and purposes, President David
D. Johnson, ‘21, at the business
meeting of the Alumni Association,
undertook to dramatize the birth of
the group.

Chartered on June 29, 1910,
Washington and Lee Alumni, Inc.
included in its list of original of-
ficers and directors some very fa-
mous names of the times. There
were George E. Chamberlain, who
was four times Governor of Oregon
and later United States Senator;
Robert L. Owen of Muskogee,
Oklahoma, also a Senator; William
A. McCorkle, native of Virginia
who served West Virginia as Gov-
ernor; and Thomas Nelson Page
of ambassadorial fame. In praising
the famous men who preceded the
present members, President John-
son declared, “We are not envious,
only proud that our association

14

 

was launched by such luminaries.”

He also reminded the group that
the Alumni Association was formed
for the benefit of the University, to
assist it in all proper ways, and “‘to
keep the bond between the Unt-
versity and her alumni close and
continuous.”

In concluding, he declared, “In-
sofar as I know, there is no ceiling
on dreams, be they ever so fantas-
tic. In this clumsy fashion, I am
trving to say that we—all of us—
should dream BIG for Washington
and Lee.”

ALUMNI NEWS

The Alumni Board of Trustees,
at its meeting June 11, 1959, unan-
imously approved the transfer of
one thousand dollars from the
profits on the sale of Washington
and Lee chairs, to the University
for the John Graham Scholarship
Fund. Over three thousand dollars
are now in the Fund.

Lacrosse Men ‘Tour
Australia This Summer

Ten lacrosse players from Wash-
ington and Lee and their young
coach, Bob McHenry, are spending
the summer in Australia, engaging
teams from “Down Under” in the
sport of lacrosse.

The athletes, accompanied by
eleven lacrosse men from the Unt1-
versity of Virginia, left New York
by air on June 27, 1959, for a six-
week, ten-game good will tour of
the continent. It marked the first
time an American team had ever
traveled to Australia to play the
game. In 1956, a Washington and
Lee team traveled to Great Britain
for a successful tour, winning eight
of its nine games against all-star
competition.

Although the team had to pay
all traveling expenses to get there,
in Australia the boys are guests of
the Australian Lacrosse Council
and its supporters. Hosts are pro-
viding lodging, meals, and _ travel-
ing expenses.

The Washington and Lee-Vir-
ginia team played three Western
Australia teams in Perth on July
7, g, 11, and three southern teams
on July 18, 22, and 25 in Adelaide.
On July 2, the team participated
in the Australian Lacrosse Carnival
in Melbourne, playing four games.
Finals were a contest between the
Americans and an all-star Austral-
ian team.

ROANOKE

The Roanoke, Virginia, chapter
met May 27, 1959, at the Roanoke
Country Club, where the following
officers were elected: president,
Robert W. Spessard, ’39; vice-presi-
dent, Jack B. Coulter, ’49; secretary-

The last mile as undergraduates—1959 Commencement Processional.

University News

m A GENERAL SALARY increase of five
per cent for all full-time faculty
and staff members at Washington
and Lee was approved by the board
of trustees at its June meeting. The
increase will become effective Sep-
tember 1, 1959, and it marks the
thirteenth time since 1946 that
Washington and Lee has raised
University salaries.

‘The trustees also authorized Uni-
versity architects to proceed with
plans, specifications, and bids for
a new University maintenance cen-
ter. ‘The center is first in the pro-
posed $2,000,000 building program
which will be financed by the capi-
tal funds campaign now under way
throughout the country. The new
maintenance facility will make it
possible to remove several build-
ings from the campus _ location
where the new science buildings
are to be constructed.

Architects were also authorized
to draw up preliminary plans for
the proposed new biology and geol-
ogy building, and the physics build-
ing. However, no work on the sci-

18

ence facilities will begin until
funds for their construction are “in
hand or in sight,’ President Fran-
cis P. Gaines declared. More than
half of the $2,000,000 for the new
project has been collected or
pledged thus far, during the first
part of the two-year drive.

m THE CALYX FOR 1959 was dedicat-
ed to retiring President Francis P.
Gaines, “unforgettable friend and
advisor.”

The citation reads, in part: “So
completely has the personal charac-
ter of Dr. Gaines permeated every
phase of our life at college that any
praise seems faint indeed. We know
him to be a man whose principles
and integrity have served both him-
self and each of us as a guide in
our education and daily lives.
These principles embody the pride,
tradition, honor, and heritage
which are our legacy as students at
the institution whose course he has
furthered so greatly.

“... It is, then, to Francis Pendle-
ton Gaines, educator, administrat-

In his traditional Calyx message
to the graduates, Dr. Gaines wrote:
“In the normal collegiate proce-
dure you have achieved a measure
of knowledge, of appreciation for
beauty, of the discipline of inquiry,
of the loveliness of living with oth-
er people. If however, the tradi-
tions of your Alma Mater have in-
fluenced you, then Washington
and Lee has done more for you
than all of these things.... With
affection and with respect, I greet
my last class. You will represent the
fruitage of your training and you
will enter into the heritage of your
Alma Mater.”

# Dr. GAINEs, retiring in Septem-
ber as president of the University,
has been honored by the Virginia
Foundation for Independent Col-
leges. At its annual meeting in June
at Hot Springs, the Foundation
presented him with a special cita-
tion for “distinguished and notable
service to higher education in Vir-
ginia.”’

Dr. Gaines was one of the found-
ers of the group, and served for
the first two years as its president.

The foundation had the best year
in its six-year history last year.
Three hundred and eighty-six busi-
ness firms in Virginia contributed
$477,545, which was distributed to
the Foundation’s twelve member
colleges. Most of the money goes
toward increasing faculty salaries,
but some goes for other operating
expenses.

Five new trustees were elected at
the meeting, and one is Dr. Fred
Carrington Cole, president-elect of
Washington and Lee.

He was master at Kent School
and St. Albans school and had been
on the faculty of Lafayette College
for eight years before coming to
Washington and Lee.

His talents as a pianist brought
pleasure to many, and he played
regularly for the meetings of the
Kiwanis and Rotary clubs in Lex-
ington.

He is survived by his widow, and
one son, Richard Henry Shelley of
Springfield, Virginia. Another son,
Dana Wilson Shelley, was killed in
Korea in 1950. A baby son was

m LAST JUNE, President Gaines
made the commencement addresses
at three colleges, University of Vir-
ginia, Roanoke College, and at
Washington and Lee. This June,
he cut it down to two. Besides his
traditional remarks at the Uni-
versity’s graduation here, he also
spoke to seniors of Wake Forest
college in Winston-Salem, North
Carolina. Before coming to Wash-

color, with musical background.
Second place was won by Robert
L. Elder of Nashville, for ‘“Foot-
notes,” a narrative film in black
and white using expressive feet and
hands.

Eight student-produced films were
entered in the competition, and
judges said they were impressed by
“the high level of interest and ex-
pressive quality” of all entries.

The James Street Awards were
established in 1954 by the late au-
thor, to encourage originality and
creativity in the audio-visual arts.

= TWO WASHINGTON AND LEE stu-
dents were killed in automobile ac-
cidents during the final weeks of
college. Paul Rutherford, III, a
sophomore, died May 1, 1959, from
injuries which occurred in a wreck
near Poughkeepsie, New York, on
April 26. He was visiting in the
area for the weekend, and was
alone in his car at the time of the
accident. He was a resident of West
Hartford, Connecticut.

An overturned sports car claimed
the life of Jacques Perry Dubois of
Mexico City, Mexico, a junior, on
May 28, 1959, a few miles from Lex-
ington on the Collierstown road.
He was also alone in his car at
the time of the accident.

The Parents’ Advisory Council
currently has a special committee
studying recommendations to make
to the University concerning stu-

Virginia Newspapers Pay Tribute
To President F. P. Gaines

N THE YEAR since Dr. Francis P.
Gaines announced that he
would retire as president of Wash-
ington and Lee on September 1,
1959, there have been many news-
paper comments on his twenty-
nine years of administration. We
present some of them here, gleaned
from editorial scources in the Old
Dominion:

THE ROANOKE TIMES
Roanoke, Virginia

“Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines
is a member of a family which has
rendered notable service to edu-
cation. His own career has made
him one of the country’s outstand-
ing leaders in that field.

“Washington and Lee had a long
and distinguished history when Dr.
Gaines took up his duties there. ...
Under his tenure, the university
has continued in its great tradi-
tions of learning, advancing to the
topmost rank of the nation’s liber-
al arts institutions.... Last year,
the Chicago Tribune conducted a
survey of American universities,
coeducational

institutions, men’s

colleges and women’s colleges.
Schools were rated on the basis of
qualification of faculty members,
academic standards, physical facili-
ties, etc. Washington and Lee stood
out among the top ten men’s col-
leges. Only two other colleges in
the South were in the top-ranking
ten in any category.

“This is, we think, the best stand-
ard for measuring Dr. Gaines’ sta-
ture as an educator. Beyond that,

9¢

nN

Virginians honor him for his sub-
stantial contributions
areas of civic life. He is an articu-
late spokesman for all good causes.
We hope that in the years ahead,
Virginia will continue to have the
benefit of his good counsel and able

leadership.”

in many

THE LYNCHBURG NEWS
Lynchburg, Virginia

“... There will be few if any to
challenge the comment of James
R. Caskie, rector of Washington
and Lee University, that ‘if the ac-
complishments could be actually
stated, it would be found that no
other man has done so much for
our university as has Dr. Gaines.’

“That Dr. and Mrs. Gaines will
continue to live at their Rockbridge
County home is considerable com-
pensation to those who cannot ac-
cept the idea of the Lexington com-
munity without him.

“Widely known as an accom-
plished speaker, in such demand
that is has been a matter of amaze-
ment that he could accept and fill
so many engagements so well—but
with a drain upon his energies well
known to his intimates, and hardly
perceptible to others who thought
he spoke with extemporaneous ease
—Dr. Gaines was also widely rec-
ognized as a raconteur, a superb
companion at a dinner or in any
gathering where you could be close
enough to experience the man’s vig-
orous charm and not miss anything
of what he said.

“Among his accomplishments are

the building of a strong faculty, a
steady lifting of the academic stand-
ards, an elimination of professional-
ism in the university’s intercolleg!-
ate sports program, and strong con-
tributions to the effectiveness of
the Virginia Foundation of Inde-
pendent Colleges, which he headed
for two years.

‘ . In his retirement, he will be
held in the highest esteem as a dis-
tinguished Virginian, and it will be
surprising indeed if he does not
continue to add services and dis-
tinctions to his long list.”

THE TIMES-DISPATCH
Richmond, Virginia

“... Washington and Lee was a
fine center of the higher learning
when Frank Gaines took the presi-
dency at the beginning of the great
depression, and he has made it even
finer. Faculty standards have been
raised, entrance and other require-
ments have been made stiffer, and
the physical assets have been more
than quadrupled during Dr.
Gaines’ 29 years at the helm.

“Under his leadership, a faculty
of able and vigorous scholars has
been built. It was under his leader-
ship, too, that Washington and Lee
became the first men’s college in
the South to require passage of the
college board examinations for en-
trance.

“The Lexington university also
has been first among the larger edu-
cational institutions in Virginia to
abolish subsidized athletics, a pol-
icy which has been courageously

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

continued, despite the howls of
many alumni.

“Closely associated historically
with both George Washington and
Robert E. Lee, Washington and
Lee is recognized as being imbued
with the traditions of the Old
South. Yet it is one of the most
cosmopolitan centers of learning
in the United States. A survey by
Dartmouth College a few years ago
showed that Washington and Lee
had a wider and more even distri-
bution of its students among the
states of the Union than any Ameri-
can college or university.

“During his 29 years at Washing-
ton and Lee, Dr. Gaines has done
much to give the institution its
high standing in various fields, and
at the same time to give the univer-
sity the cachet of his own dynamic
personality. One of the foremost
orators of his time, he is also a
scholar of note, having written a
definitive historical work, The
Southern Plantation, based on a
colossal amount of research.

“,..Since accepting the presi-
dency of Washington and Lee, Dr.
Gaines has received offers of other
college and university presidencies
in the North and South. It is
ground for thanks that he has chos-
en to remain at Lexington. His
years there have been so productive
of good for Washington and Lee,
for Virginia, and the nation that
we can only be grateful that he
chose to carve out his career in the
Old Dominion. It has been a bril-
lant and well-rounded career in
many ways.”

WORLD NEWS
Roanoke, Virginia

“Among leaders in the field of
higher education, Dr. Francis Pen-
dleton Gaines, president of Wash-
ington and Lee University, ranks
with the most esteemed.

“His announcement he will re-
tire at the conclusion of the school
session is cause for regret among

SUMMER 1959

the people of Lexington, the stu-
dent body, faculty, and graduates,
and his many other friends.

“For Dr. Gaines, it will be a well-
earned retirement. His decision to
step down, prompted by ‘considera-
tions of general health,’ comes at
the age of 67, and after a lifetime
of devotion to the education of
youth.

‘“,.. Besides recognition as one of
the nation’s leading educators, Dr.
Gaines is widely known as an ora-
tor. Some of the nation’s most
learned groups have had the oppor-
tunity to sample his wit and sagac-
ity. And in recognition of his lead-
ership in the field of education,
fourteen colleges and universities
have conferred honorary degrees
upon him.

‘“... For his contributions to edu-
cation, the nation is indebted to
Dr. Gaines. Washington and Lee
and Dr. Gaines are synonymous in
the minds of most people. It is dif-
ficult even to comprehend Wash-
ington and Lee without its gifted
president.”

THE LEADER
Staunton, Virginia

“...Dr. Gaines has supplied in-
spirational leadership and vigorous
personal effort. He has _ never
spared himself in Washington and
Lee’s service, especially in its cam-
paign for endowment, for which he
traveled widely and spoke frequent-
ly. His magnificent command of the
English language, his eloquence
and sincerity are great assets which
he has used not only for the college,
but for many public causes, local,
state, and national. He has given
generously of his time and talents
to boards and foundations, among
the latter having been the Wood-
row Wilson Birthplace Foundation
of Staunton, which he served as
trustee and president.

‘When the time comes for Dr.
Gaines to step down, he will do so
with the admiration and affection

of Virginians, alumni throughout
the country, and of educators who
have watched the progress. of his
distinguished college with interest,
and some no doubt with envy. He
can retire with the satisfaction of
a task brilliantly done, and with
the thought as he has put it, that
‘no man ever enjoyed a nobler
privilege. I am grateful to God for
that privilege and for all coopera-

> 99

tions in my endeavor’.

ROCKBRIDGE
COUNTY NEWS
Lexington, Virginia

“...In telling Washington and
Lee alumni here last week of Dr.
Cole’s election (as president), Mr.
James R. Caskie, rector of the col-
lege board, said he admired Dr.
Cole’s courage. It took great cour-
age, he added, to follow Dr. Francis
P. Gaines as president of the col-
lege.

“In that sentiment, those con-
nected with the college and resi-
dents of the entire community will
join. Dr. Cole will, we know, be the
first to say that he does not expect
to take Dr. Gaines’ place. That
would be an impossibility. The
magnetic force of Dr. Gaines on the
platform, his friendliness and
approachableness, and _ genuine
warmth of personality would be
dificult to match. During his 29-
year incumbency, the college has
received great recognition as an
educational institution and the en-
dowment has been increased in
phenomenal fashion.

“But we predict that Dr. Cole
will utilize this courage that has
been attributed to him, and _ his
abundance of training and exper-
ience to build well upon the foun-
dations prepared by Dr. Gaines and
his predecessors. And he can be
assured that this community, as well
as the college family, will accord
him all of the support and encour-
agement that is within their power
to give.”

Au Revoir, Dr. Gaines

(Continued from page 5)

Temple Graves, in his syndicated
column, explained it this way:
“... Almost every university in
search of a new head seems to try
first for Francis Pendleton Gaines,
president of Washington and Lee.
... The great point of him is this
quality of leadership—and in the
right directions. He is one of the
most eloquent men in America. He
has a spiritual quality about him
that is instantly obvious. He is
deeply the philosopher. And his
students at Lexington are aware
of their president, aware of him as
a man, a force, a light, a vivid
leader in moral and _ intellectual
direction. I am glad Dr. Gaines
has turned down all offers. I
wouldn’t have him leave Lexington
for anything. He is a man made
by his own brave imagination and
no other scene on earth could so
catch and hold his imagination as
does the one at Washington and
Lee. But I wish every university
in the land could have such a pres-
ident... .”

The University will be ever grate-
ful to Dr. Gaines for the nearly
three decades of encompassing serv-
ice he has given to the school.
George Washington gave his funds,
General Robert E. Lee gave his
leadership, but Francis P. Gaines
has given himself to Washington
and Lee, and the University will
not soon forget him.

As James R. Caskie, rector of the
board, declared, “I am of the opin-
ion that if the accomplishments
could be actually stated, it would
be found that no other man has
done so much for our university as
has Dr. Gaines.”

So au revoir, Dr. Gaines. Gen-
erations of men will remember
your name with respect, admira-
tion, and love. Surely no man
could want more from life than
this!
