THE COVER

Many pictures have been made of the annual Academic pro-
cession as it approached Lee Chapel down the center walk
from Washington Hall. This picture was made from a new
angle. For the first time the commencement exercises were
held at a spot on the campus, in front of the President’s home,
where shade was provided for all. A most impressive ceremony.

The 203rd Commencement

Dr. Gaines was the principal
speaker at the graduating exer-
cises, held under the shade of the
trees on the campus in front of
the president’s house on Friday,
June 6. He told a class of 195
craduating seniors that the
“bugles” which were calling them
to the service of their country in
this day of peril, were also chang-
ing the purposes of education.

Honorary doctorate degrees were
conferred on W. Turner Catledge,
newly appointed executive manag-
ing editor of the New York
Times and Kennon C. Whittle,
LL.B., °14, Justice of the Virginia
Supreme Court. Mr. Catledge re-
ceived a Doctor of Letters degree
and Judge Whittle, whose father,
Judge Stafford C. Whittle, ’69, was
similarly honored 34 years ago, re-
ceived a Doctor of Laws degree.

Dr. Gaines announced the re-
ceipt of several substantial gifts by
the university and disclosed that
the University Board of Trustees,
recognizing “competence and devo-
tion,” had ordered a general five per
cent salary increase for faculty and
staff. In this connection Dr. Gaines
said the University had received
another gift, the residual interest in
a trust fund amounting to $43,780,
from Mrs. Alfred I. DuPont of
Jacksonville, Florida. Washington

 

Marshal Charles P. Light leads the Academic procession. His daughter is the small
admirer on the left.

and Lee now has 85 per cent of two
trust funds established by Mrs.
duPont, its own share running
well over $800,000. A gift of
$25,000 from Maurice Cafritz of
Washington toward a new build-
ing and gifts totaling $20,000 for
development of the Journalism De-
partment. The Alumni Fund total
for this year was reported to be
$33,000.

Commenting on the troubled
world conditions, Dr. Gaines told
the graduates, “If this were a con-

ventional time, and I could give
you a traditional blessing, how hap-
py I would be. Bugles, however, are
sounding for you, and these bugles
cannot be ignored. And the sound-
ing of the trumpets,” he added,
“are changing the purposes of edu-
cation.”

“American education has been
indicted for being an instrument for
the realization of personal ambi-
tion,” Dr. Gaines said. Now per-
sonal ambition has to be placed
second by the college graduate.

A New Setting for Graduation Exercises

Futhermore, education can no
longer be considered “an exquisite
instrument for escapism.” The best
definition of education today is the
biblical quotation, “Ye shall know
the truth and the truth shall make
you free.” But before the human
mind knows the truth to make it
free there are great commandments
to be kept and loyalties to be
achieved. Spiritual commitment
must run ahead of personal ambi-
tion.

The valedictorian of the 1952
class was Henry W. Jones, Jr.,
son of Henry W. Jones, ’24.

 

Graduation Grandeur

From the Miami, Florida
“Herald” Social Scenes |

June 17, 1952 |
By MartHa LuMMus |

There’s a special grandeur about
a graduation held on the campus of
a university, in the shade of trees
that are centuries old. Perhaps it’s
the spaciousness of the out-of-doors,
the sunshine, the singing of birds,
that combine to make such cere-
monies so impressive.

The particular graduation of
which I speak and which I traveled
to Virginia to witness, was at
Washington and Lee. An addi-

4.

tional attraction to the ceremony
was the University’s famed colon-
nade and historic red brick build-
ings—a _ pictorial and_ historical
backdrop to the scenic setting.
And I can’t help but believe that
just as surely as the name of
Rosert E. LEE was on the lips of
President Francis P. Gaines, of
Washington and Lee, when he de-
livered his annual address follow-
ing presentation of diplomas, and
as surely as the grave of this fa-
mous Southern General is located
in nearby Lee Chapel on the cam-

pus, so his spirit pervaded those re-
cent graduation ceremonies.
Students who spend four years
in the environs of that University,
at least in my opinion, can’t help
but have an opportunity to absorb
some of the best traditions of the
South, (held sacred at W. and L.)
and learn, at least in part, the prin-
ciples that made General Lee, this
University’s president following the
War between the States, one of the
ereatest heroes of American his-
tory. And I say that advisedly, hav-
ing watched three Miami stu-
dents—Ed Ellis, Talbot Trammell
and my own son, Lynn Lummus,
get their diplomas in the above
mentioned historic setting.

 

W. and L. Men Receive
Degrees at Harvard

The following Washington and
Lee graduates received advanced
degrees from Harvard University at
commencement exercises on June
19, 1952:

David D. Bien,
Master of Arts.

Edward B. Tenney, B.S. ’*50—
Master of Business Administration.

500 Alumni Return for 1952 Finals

Some 500 alumni of Washing-
ton and Lee returned to the cam-
pus for Finals, June 4-6. Among
them were a number of the 26
fathers who had sons in the grad-
uating class.

Starting with the Alumni
Smoker, held in the Student Union
on the evening of June 4, followed
by the Senior Ball, the festivities
continued on Thursday with meet-
ings of the University Board of
Trustees in the morning; the Alum-
ni Luncheon on the back campus at
noon and the meeting of the Gen-
eral Alumni Association in Wash-
ington Chapel at 2:00 p.m. The re-
ception of President and Mrs.
Gaines for alumni, seniors and
guests preceded the Final Ball.
Graduation exercises were held on
the campus in front of the Presi-
dent’s house at eleven o’clock on
Friday, June 6.

PAUL C. BUFORD, B.A. ’13, LL.B. ’15, has been a member of the Alumni

Board of Trustees for the past two years. President of Shenandoah Life Insurance
Company of Roanoke, Virginia; practiced law continuously in Roanoke from 1915
until he became president of the above Company. He was married to Anne Warren
in 1924 and they have four children, Anne (now Mrs. Beverley Berkeley, Jr.), Guy
Warren, Paul C., Jr., and Susan Buford. At W. and L. he was a member of A.T.O.
social fraternity, Phi Delta Phi, White Friars, Phi Beta Kappa and O.D.K.

hoped to win as many games as
he could with such a team.

Mr. Buford paid tribute to the
services of Athletic Director Rich-

quished his post as baseball coach
after 29 years of service. Mr.

Report of the
Alumni Secretary

Last year I reported to you that
your Alumni Association had had
its best year since my incumbency
as secretary, and my hopes were
that it would continue to grow and
that I could make similar reports of

steady progress from year to year.

I repeat the statement, the As-
sociation has had its best year and
this applies to all phases of alumni
activity. In my travels during the
year, which included many miles
and many parts of the country,
I do not believe that I have ever
found among our alumni a greater
interest in the affairs of the Uni-
versity. Practically all of our organ-
ized chapters have held from one to
three meetings during the year—
all well attended. A representative
from the University has been pres-
ent in almost every case.

The interest of our far-flung
alumni is not confined to the past
accomplishments or present activ-
ities of Washington and Lee but is
vitally concerned with its future. I
believe our mail—other than letters
pertaining to the Fund—has been
heavier than I have ever known it
to be, mainly filled with inquiries
from alumni in connection with the
education of their sons and other
boys they think are good Wash-
ington and Lee prospects. I know
of no greater service an alumnus
can render than to send us the right
kind of boy. This year there are
approximately 100 sons of alumni
in our student body, 26 of them

Nearly all of our alumni chap-
ters now have committees whose
sole purpose is to interest in the
University boys graduating from
their local high and preparatory
schools. Our Cleveland, Ohio,
Chapter is a good example of how a
well-organized alumni group can
serve the University. Their “pros-
pective-student committee” visits
each local high and preparatory
school in the area at least twice a
year. Our freshman class entering
the fall of 1950 had nine boys from
the Cleveland area.

We feel that our Student-Alumni
Relations Program is progressing
here on the campus. And we know
the present student body is better
acquainted with the activities of the
Alumni Association than ever be-
fore. Prior to the inauguration of
this program, I doubt seriously if
any young alumnus had a true pic-
ture of the objectives of the As-

sociation, and its means of realiz-
ing these objectives, until he was
out of college at least five years.
The results of this program are re-
flected in the many calls we have
from student organizations looking
for assistance and _ information.
Further, 23 per cent of the total
contributors to our 1951 Alumni
Fund came from the last ten classes
to graduate. We feel, then, that our
program of educating students in
their future responsibilities has
caught on—and that we may count
on them in the years to come.

A generous portion of the March
Alumni Magazine was devoted to
the report on our 1951 Alumni
Fund. In addition to this report, it
carried the analysis of our Fund
through the period of its existence,
1933-1951. We pointed out that
development had been slow but
that progress had been steady. The
$40,490.24 received in 1951 ex-
ceeded by $12,000 any previous
year.

The Alumni Board decided that
all money received from the 1951
Fund should be handed to the Trus-
tees of the University and expend-
ed at the direction of the University
Board of Trustees. We think in
these uncertain times it was a wise
decision.

In spite of the progress we have
made, we are far behind other col-
leges of similar size in annual giv-
ing. The amount of money re-

Bank Building, Fort Worth, Texas

ceived last year was most encour-
aging when we consider that only
1,958 alumni, out of our total of
10,327, contributed to the Fund.
Our analysis showed that a total
of 5,468 alumni have contributed
to the Fund at one time or another.
At a minimum, 4,000 of this num-
ber should be responding annually.
This is not too much to expect—
the percentage of givers to many
other college funds far exceeds this
number.

I would like to say something
about each of our 86 class agents,
because any credit for our results
belongs to them, but you will un-
derstand that it cannot be fully said
in a report of this kind. They all
did a grand job and my experience
in working with this fine group was
most pleasant. I should also like
to include my thanks to the several
hundred alumni who have served
in the past as class agents. To them
must go a lot of credit for building

8

the Fund on a firm foundation with-
out which the present structure
could not exist.

Our 1952 Fund is progressing
satisfactorily. We are running
some $3,000 or $4,000 behind a
comparative date of last year. How-
ever, we are happy to report to
you the number of contributors at
this time is running along about as
last year.

The financial situation of the
University has not changed mate-
rially from last year and surveys
show that one-half of all our private
liberal arts institutions are now
operating in the red. Many of them
are dipping into their endowment
capital. We don’t want this to hap-
pen at Washington and Lee. The
best preventive we know of is con-
certed annual giving by the alumni
through the class agents.

In closing this report, I want to
thank your Alumni Board of Trus-
tees for the fine cooperation they
have given the alumni staff. Espe-
cially do I thank your president,
Kenneth P. Lane. His guidance
and interest have been a constant
inspiration to us. We are happy
that the by-laws of the Association
provide that the past president
serve one year as a member of the
Alumni Board of Trustees.

Dr. Hancock Retires

From Teaching Career

One of the most prominent pro-
fessors of Washington and Lee
University won’t take his usual
place in the classroom next fall
when the school opens its 204th
academic year. For Dr. Glover D.
Hancock, first dean of the School
of Commerce, has retired from all
teaching duties after 42 years.

“From now on it’s fishing, golf-
ing and relaxing,” Dr. Hancock
says, “in addition to as much read-
ing as I can cram in.”

Although officially retired as
dean of the Commerce School in
1949, Dr. Hancock continued
teaching a class or two until the
close of this year’s second term.

President Francis P. Gaines

said Dean Hancock now takes his
place among the men whose contri-
bution of life has been as important

Dr. Glover D. Hancock
as any other factor in the honorable
tradition of Washington and Lee.

Dr. Hancock came to Washing-
ton and Lee in 1910 when there
were only two commerce profes-
sors on the faculty. In 1920 he was
chosen to head the new School of
Commerce and Administration, the
first school in the South to offer
a commerce curriculum on the col-
legiate level.

Since then, thousands of stu-
dents have taken Dr. Hancock’s
courses in money and banking and
other fields. Many of them now
hold top executive posts through-
out the world.

A friend recently mentioned to
Dr. Hancock that now he has re-
tired, he ought to be able to begin
having a good time. But the former
dean replied, with a characteristic
smile: “What do you mean by
having a good time? That’s exactly
what Pve been having these past
42 years—and getting paid for
it, too.”

 

Schuchart Appointed
As Director of Utilities

P. M. ScuHucHart, who has
had a comprehensive background
of more than a score of years in
the Bell System and Independent
telephone industry and for the past
15 months has been the chief of the
Wire Communications Branch of
the Federal Civil Defense Admin-

10

istration, was appointed May 20,
by the Florida Railroad and Pub-
lic Utilities Commission as Direc-
tor of its Utilities Division, a newly
created post, effective June 15.

In his new position, Mr. Schu-
chart will be responsible for the
service and tariff phases of the
utilities in Florida—telephone, tele-
graph, electric light and power, and
gas. He is resigning from the
FCDA staff June 11.

Mr. Schuchart joined the FCDA
in February, 1951, at the request
of former Florida Governor Mil-
lard Caldwell, shortly after the lat-
ter was named FCDA Administra-
tor. As Chief of the Wire Com-
munications Branch, he has been
serving as liaison between the
FCDA and the commuciations in-
dustry of the nation.

Recently he completed arrange-
ments for the establishment of the
Federal Civil Defense national
TWX _ network, which links the
national FCDA headquarters with
nine regional offices and the 48
state control centers. One of his
last projects was taking over the
operation and _ responsibility by
FCDA of the civil air raid warn-
ing network with key points in
every state and most of the leading
cities, and he is spending this week
in the Rocky Mountain area for the
completion of the transition of the
nationwide network to the FCDA
from the Air Force. He also has
been active in the development of
transfer relays for the rapid pro-
vision of alternate routes and ser-
vices by telephone in the event of
an emergency. During his FCDA
service he has been a lecturer on
wire communications at the Civil
Defense Staff College at Olney,
Maryland.

Mr. Schuchart started his tele-
phone career with the Bell Tele-
phone Co. of Pennsylvania imme-
diately after his graduation in
1926 from Washington and Lee
University. He continued his as-
sociation with the Bell System un-
til World War II. During the war
he served as civilian telephone en-
gineer in the Signal Corps with

the headquarters of the Third Ser-
vice Command, and in this assign-
ment was responsible for the traf-
fic operation of all the posts in the
command, which embraced Vir-
ginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania.
As a result of his accomplishments
he was awarded the Certificate of
Commendation, the highest award
possible at Service Command level.

At the conclusion of his work
with the Signal Corps in 1946, Mr.
Schuchart was appointed by the
Central Telehone Co. as General
Traffic Manager and Traffic engi-
neer, with headquarters at the Vir-
ginia Telephone & Telegraph Co.
at Charlottesville, Virginia. A year
later, he was transferred to Talla-
hassee as General Manager of the
Southeastern Telephone Co. Mr.
Schuchart has been author of sev-
eral articles in technical journals
on telephone traffic and engineer-
ing. He has also been a speaker at
several state Independent telephone
association conventions.

edge they imparted has become
muddled and faded. This does not
mean that they have failed in their
primary objective, for by our asso-
ciation with them we gain lessons in
human relations far more valuable
than the abstract fragments of
learning with which they sought to
inoculate us. The man to whom
we dedicate this yearbook is that
sort of professor. He has been able
to preserve the student outlook
which he acquired during his own
undergraduate days at Washing-
ton and Lee and to inject it into his
teaching and his extra-academic
relations with students. His in-
terest in campus affairs has been
manifested by his twenty-five years
of service on the Publications Board
and by his unflagging participation
as a faculty member of ODK. His
warm, man-to-man manner toward
the individual student has endeared
him to those who know him and has
fostered an ideal faculty-student re-
lationship. This easygoing familiar-
ity has bred no contempt but rather
sincere respect and genuine fond-
ness among a large part of the stu-
dent body. Their attitude toward
him has been summed up innum-
erable times in words similar to
these—“No one should go through
W. and L. without taking a Hig
course.”

“We join with his other admirers
in dedicating this 1952 Calyx to
Mr. John Higgins Williams.”

NEW YORK

The New York Alumni Associa-

Dinner Dance on Friday evening,
April 25, at the Hotel Warwick.
Accommodations at the Warwick

the Pine Room for dinner, and
dancing in the mirrored Warwick
Room. Roger Stanley and _ his
three-piece orchestra played roving
music during the dinner and for
dancing later. An interesting item
in this connection is that Jerry
Shard and his orchestra who had
made a sensational recording of
“The Swing” and “Yes Sir, That’s
My Baby,” were playing in the
Raleigh Room downstairs, during
the alumni party. The hotel, glad to
cash in on an opportunity for pub-
