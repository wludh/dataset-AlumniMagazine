Lest alumni, yielding to the influences of time and distance and varied interests,
take for granted the impressive strengths of their University, or in deference to dis-
cussions of the day lose sight of her fundamental mission, the Alumni Magazine
offers this timely reminder, presented originally before Lynchburg alumni.

About the University

MARVIN B. PERRY, JR.
Associate Professor of English

$S A TEACHER at Washington and
Lee, appearing before Wash-
ington and Lee alumni, it is to be
expected that I shall talk about
Washington and Lee. But I want to
talk about Washington and Lee
for many more and better reasons
than simply because I teach there
and you went there. In the few years
I have been in Lexington I have
become a tremendous admirer of
the school; I have a deep affection
for it and a high enthusiasm for its
future prospects. Tonight I would
like to tell you something of my
reasons for admiring it and for
feeling so enthusiastic about its
present and future.

All of us could talk about Wash-
ington and Lee for hours—in many
different ways; it is a comprehensive
subject, and I cannot hope to cover
it tonight in any comprehensive
way. Rather, what I have to say
will serve, like the fan-dancer’s fan,

to call attention to the subject with-
out covering it fully.

I want to talk about the Univer-
sity from two points of view. First,
I would like to give you some of
my reactions as a relative newcomer
to Washington and Lee and Lex-
ington, some of the things I was
struck with and have continued to
like; and second, as one of the
Washington and Lee family (like
each of you) I want to touch on
some of our mutual concerns which
grow from our common love for
the University.

When we came to Lexington four
years ago, we were struck at once by
many things, and as we lived there

2

others became apparent to us and
have continued to be sources of our
liking for the school and for our
life there. We were struck immedi-
ately by the beauty of the grounds
and buildings, and their fine up-
keep; by the friendly atmosphere of
University and town; by the cordial
town and college relations.

We were impressed by the active
part played by members of the col-

lege family in Lexington’s civic and_ |

religious life. This I believe is a

significant commentary on the kind ~

of men we have in the faculty and
administration at the University.

At the college I was impressed—
and still am—with the great variety
of activities offered, both curricular
and extra-curricular: in athletics, in
social events (which I believe are
particularly well-run), in a healthy
and active religious program par-
ticipated in by well-rounded boys,
by many lectures and discussion
groups, by the excellent work of
the ‘Troubadours. And I was also
impressed by such unusual and (for
me) new student activities as those
of the Student War Memorial Schol-
arship Fund, and the Friends of
the Library, which raises about
$1,000 a year for library books and
maintains the Browsing Room.

From the first I liked the stu-
dents, too. They were well-rounded,
intelligent, courteous. Our best stu-
dents are as good as the best any-
where. Like all teachers, I guess, I
wish we had more of them, but
there are few really poor students.
‘Those in academic trouble usually

get there through failure to work
rather than through lack of ability.

Also new to me were the College
Fntrance Examination Board’s Ap-
titude ‘Tests, which the University
required of all applicants. I like
them, and find them most helpful
and indicative in forecasting a boy’s
capability. Of course, they are
chiefly helpful to the Admissions
Office, for they are usually accurate

indications of a boy’s ability to do

college work. But in addition, Col-

‘lege Boards are also an undoubted

prestige item. As an educator, I am
proud to be in a college requiring
them, in fact the first men’s college
in the South to do so. Incidental-
ly, many other colleges in the South
are now adopting them: the Uni-
versity of Virginia for all out-of-
state students, Furman, Sewanee,
and others.

Freshman Camp impressed me,
too, as a most valuable part of
Washington and Lee’s orientation
program. It is an excellent ice-
breaker and morale builder, largely
because of the splendid way in
which it is organized and run.

Even before I knew the students,
I was most impressed by Washing-
ton and Lee’s administration, es-
pecially in the persons of Dr.
Gaines, Dean Leyburn, and Dean
Gilliam. And I am still impressed
after having worked for them
almost four years! I know of no col-
lege anywhere which has a more
able and outstanding trio of top
men. (Among educators in this sec-
tion I suspect there would be wide

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

agreement on this.) Frankly, it was
my immediate liking and respect
for these three men which was cru-
cial in my deciding to come to
Washington and Lee. I have had no
reason to change my mind.

The administration of your Uni-
versity, I have always found, has
high aims and standards, without
being unrealistic; it has a clear
idea of Washington and Lee’s pur-
pose and philosophy; that is, it
knows where it is going and why.
This, I might add, is not so wide-
spread a condition as you might
think. Further, I have always found
your administrative officers recep-
tive to suggestions and questions,
warm and frank in personal rela-
tionships, always concerned for the
welfare and careful training of the
individual student.

Nor do I mean to limit my char-
acterization of the administration
to these three gentlemen. It is true
up and down the line, of new-
comers and veterans alike.

As a relative newcomer myself, 1
can speak, I hope, of another group
for whom I have the greatest ad-
miration and regard, the Washing-
ton and Lee Faculty. I know few
colleges of our size which are able
to attract and hold men of the abil-
ity and character of those at Wash-
ington and Lee. [hey manage to
combine the dignity and perception
of scholarship with the warmth and
humanity of teaching. I have been
particularly impressed by their con-
cern for and cooperation with the
students. In fact, I know of no
school where the faculty does so
much not only to help with and
advise student activities, but fre.
quently (on student invitation) to
participate in such events as min-
strel shows,
dance planning and chaperoning,
intramural sports. Faculty teams
play student teams in volleyball,
golf, bowling, handball, ping pong.
You frequently see students and
faculty members playing squash,
tennis, and handball together. And
I was one of eight faculty members
who filled a shell and rowed against

discussion groups,

MARCH 1955

the student crew two years ago.

There is a great deal of “person-
alized” teaching at Washington and
Lee: small classes, field trips, study
projects, classes in professors’
homes. ‘The freshmen adviser sys-
tem is another phase of this con-
cern for the individual.

For me as a newcomer, too, and I
hope a reasonably young man, the
number of congenial and able
young men on the faculty, in addi.
tion to the fine senior members.
was a great attraction. I find these
men well-rounded and well-trained.
They have energy and enthusiasm,
plus great faith in what Washing-
ton and Lee is trying to do. And |
want to stress the fact that by these
“young men” I do not refer only
to academic personnel; I am think-
ing also of men like our coaches,
Bill Chipley, Billy McCann, and
Charley Herbert; Assistant Dean of
Students Jim Farrar; Frank Parsons,
who handles our publicity; and
Don Smith, our Director of Univer-
sity Development.

Incidently, one of our problems
is that of hanging on to good young
men like these. Not a few of them,
to my knowledge, have turned
down attractive offers to go else-
where, frequently at higher salaries.
‘This latter kind of offer becomes

increasingly hard to resist! ‘Che ad-
ministration, I am glad to say, is
very much concerned with this
problem of maintaining a first-rate
faculty—through adequate salaries,
continuing high standards, happy
living and teaching conditions.

A newcomer cannot help but be
impressed, too, by Washington
and Lee’s curriculum. A variety of
excellent departments with fine of-
ferings, both old-line, core disci-
plines and newer interdepartmen-
tal programs, is available for stu-
dents to choose from. Fundamen-
tals of general training like mathe-
matics, English, history, sciences,
languages (including Greek, Latin,
and Russian), plus such current ap-
plied studies as commerce, ac-
counting, “journalism and com-
munications” (which is the new
name of the Journalism Depart-
ment, indicating its increased cov-
erage in all types of mass media
communications.) ‘There are inter-
departmental offerings such as
humanities (American studies, ways
of thinking, development of ideas,
etc.) and many courses in compara-
tive literature. And as in every good
college, there are the fine arts: mu-
sic and art, both their history, or ap-
preciation, and practice. There is a
strong religion department, as evi-

denced by the fact that nine of

last year’s seniors entered theologi-

cal schools here and abroad.

These various departments are
aware of changing emphases in the
teaching of their subjects, and they
are open to new ideas, but not
quick to discard tested disciplines
and methods. A remarkable num-
ber and variety of courses are of-
fered, especially when we consider
the small size of departments. For
example, history and English, each
with about six full-time men, offer
about twenty-five courses each. ‘This
is as complete a coverage as you
will find in any undergraduate col-
lege. There are also opportunities
for flexible programs which can be
adapted to the needs of individual
students without impairing stand-
ards. I refer to honors work, tutor-
ial seminars, and the English reme-
dial tutoring program.

In summary, the Washington and
Lee curriculum seems well-planned
and yet is constantly being scruti-
nized to the end that the Universi-
ty can continue to give its young
men that ‘complete and generous
education,” in Milton’s words,
“which fits a man to perform justly,
skilfully, and magnanimously all of
the offices, both public and private,
of peace and war.” |

O MUCH THEN for Washington
S and Lee as it appears to a rela-
tive newcomer to the faculty. Now,
if you will let me, I should like to
talk to you, as it were, from within
the family.

First, on the whole I think the
the feeling at Washington and Lee
among faculty and students (and I
believe most of the alumni share
it) is that we are going places! Nat-
urally we have had our troubles
and our problems—who hasn't?
And there are some ahead. But
Washington and Lee has weathered
200 exciting and trying years, and
she continues to grow in service and
in vigor.

I have been out of college long
enough now (fifteen years) to feel,
as the typical old-grad is supposed

4

to, that the old school is going to
the dogs, that it is not what it used
to be. Oscar Wilde had a pretty
good reply to that complaint when
a friend observed to him in the
18g90’s that the theater wasn’t what
it used to be. “No,” replied Oscar,
“and it never was.” All alumni
who are interested in their college
tend to view each innovation as a
possible added indication that the
place is slipping. But all of us
know, whether we practice law or
medicine, sell insurance, or teach
school, that no institution or firm
simply stands still; it moves with
the times, improves if it can, tries
constantly to better its methods and
its product. As loyal alumni, you
expect Washington and Lee to do
no less. And you have a right to
expect that she will show prudence
and calmness, as well as courage,
in mapping her way in her third
century. I believe that she is, and I
believe that she exemplifies the in-
spiring paradox that all fine colleges
do: she manages to be as good as
she was in the old days and yet
she gets better all the time. ‘There
is little danger, I believe, that
Washington and Lee, with her hv-
ing tradition of a noble past, with
what Alfred North Whitehead calls
the “habitual vision of greatness”
always about her, will forget the
past. On the other hand, her motto,
non incautus futuri, is assurance
of her concern for the future.

Well, what are the reasons, in
concrete form, for my enthusiasm
and faith in Washington and Lee?
Most of you are aware of them, I
suspect, from President Gaines’ an-
nual report and from the Alumni
Magazine, especially a series of ex-
cellent articles in the last two 1s-
sues. But I might remind you of
a few of the most encouraging ones.
First I would cite our fine record
in student awards. In 1954, for ex-
ample, one of our graduates was
named a Rhodes Scholar, four were
awarded Fulbright Fellowships, two
others received Rotary Fellowships.
Our pre-medical graduates con-
tinued their fine record of being

accepted unanimously at top-rank
medical schools. Just recently the
Law School Moot Court team
reached the semi-finals in national
competition, being defeated by.the
eventual winner, Columbia. ROTC
and ROC (Navy) men continue to
rank at the top of their classes in
summer training. The record of
University graduates on the Vir-
ginia bar examinations is outstand-
ing: for. June, 1954, 64 per cent of
the Washington and Lee men who
took the examinations passed as
compared to a general average
throughout the state of 40 per cent;
for December, 1954, 55 per cent of
the Washington and Lee men
passed as against 31 per cent for
the total group. Even more signifi-
cant to me is the fact that the men
who compiled the enviable records
I have cited are well-rounded boys,
with a variety of interests.

In other “statistical’’ ways things
look good. Applications for the
1956 freshman class are running
more than 5 per cent ahead of this
time last year. ‘The Alumni Fund
total is running well ahead of this
time last year. College Entrance
Examination Board Aptitude test
scores continue to climb while more
and more boys apply. ‘The average
number of alumni sons in college
now exceeds that of pre-war years.
The widespread geographical dis-
tribution of our students continues,
but the percentage of freshmen
from the South increased in the last
two years from 56 to 64 percent.

For all of their excitement and
controversy, the Honor System
crisis last spring and the athletic
policy change, I believe, have dem-
onstrated in a most heartening way
the vigor and character of the en-
tire Washington and Lee communt-
ty: alumni, administration, faculty,
and students. From both these is-
sues we have emerged stronger, |
believe, and with a deeper and
clearer sense of Washington and
Lee’s true values and function, with
renewed conviction that it is a great
institution, which transcends the

DAY OR SO AFTER William A.

Chipley was named an asso-
ciate professor of physical educa-
tion and head football coach at
Washington and Lee, the Rich-
mond JT zmes-Dispatch carried a
story which began with a statement
to the effect that Bill had once
been so confused in a game he got
in the wrong huddle, and that now
he was going to coach the Gener-
als’ “amateur” gridiron forces. If
readers took this to mean _ that
Chipley is still confused, they could
not be farther from the truth, for
the former All-Southern end and
professional star knows exactly
what he is doing, where he hopes
to go, and exactly how to go about
getting there.

It was not without long consider-
ation that Chipley decided to give
up his sales position with James
Lees and Sons, rug manufacturers
in Glasgow, to cast his lot with his
Alma Mater and its new football
program. Admittedly, it was going
to be a new experience for him.
He had had plently of experience
on the playing field—three years at
Clemson, one year at Washington
and Lee, and three seasons in the
professional ranks—but his coach-
ing experience was limited to the
part-time, free-of-charge help he
had given to ends Bob Thomas
and ‘Tal Trammel during George
Barclay’s tenure on the campus.
However, if Washington and Lee
gridders next year take to him as
did these two, then there will be
no complaints. Both were quoted as
saying that they had ‘‘never known
there was so much to playing end”
until Chipley took them in tow.

Getting started with his ‘“play-
for-fun” gridders has been a task
made easier for Chipley by Boyd
Williams, another college perform-
er and ex-professional who now
makes his home in Lexington. Wil-
liams made himself a favorite with
the players through his work last
fall as coach of the interim fresh-
man-jayvee team, which was or-
ganized to keep football alive at
Washington and Lee. Wisely com-

bining the essential elements of
good naturedness, team discipline,
and good coaching, Williams won
the respect and admiration of all
those who played for him; and
when he and Chipley were an-
nounced as mainstays of Washing-
ton and Lee’s gridiron coaching
staff, no one was happier than the
team members themselves.

During the spring practice season
some forty-five boys turned out for
drills under Chipley’s direction. As
always, the big problem for the
coaches was the lack of time: Con-
ference rules limit the number of
practice days; required laboratory
work and limited late-afternoon
daylight hours restrict practice per-
iods. ‘This time factor was even
more pronounced under the new
program, for as Chipley pointed
out, he found himself working pre-
dominantly with boys, many of
whom show real promise, who were
lacking in football fundamentals.
Time, and more time, will be re-
quired to develop them.

The situation is just what Chip-
ley expected, and he is taking great

  
    
 
  

WILLIAMS—he won respect

satisfaction in working with boys
who are out for the sport because
they want to play and want to
learn. As just one example, he
points to rising sophomore Al Git-
ter of Winston-Salem, one of his
most promising quarterbacks. “‘Git-
ter will be there at the start of
practice every day, and he'll be the
last one off the field when we're
through. He just likes to play.”

And Gitter is not alone in this

respect, the head coach hastens to
add. There are plenty of others
just like him. In fact, he and Wil-
liams are counting on around sixty
candidates for fall practice.
Chipley still gets a lot of kid-
ding about his famed “wrong-way’”’
incident back in 1946, the time
when the Generals were tangling
with West Virginia’s Mountaineers
on a rain-drenched, muddy field
in Charleston. Everyone was cov-
ered with a thick coat of black mud,
as was the ball. The backs were
fumbling often; exchanges of pos-
session were frequent. It was not
until he questioned the quarter-
back’s signal call as one he didn’t
know that Chipley learned he was
in West Virginia’s huddle, and was
promptly sent back to his own side
of the scrimmage line. The Asso-
ciated Press acclaimed the event as
the “sports oddity of the year.”

Although Chipley played only
one year for the Blue and White,
he established himself as one of its
all-time greats. Named both AIll-
State and All-Southern end, his
size and ability made him a natural
for professional football. For two
seasons he was a standout perform-
er for the old Boston Yanks of the
now-defunct All-American league.
He also played for a year with the
New York Bulldogs, another team
which suspended activities after the

post-war wealth of talent passed.

Chipley continued to work to-
ward his degree in the spring while
playing football in the fall. He
graduated in 1949 with a major in
journalism, an event which brought
about a shake-up in the require-
ments of that department. And
thereby hangs another tale.

Professor O. W. Riegel, who di-
rects the Lee Memorial Journalism
Foundation, recalls how he and
other faculty members had assum-
ed all along that Chipley could
type. But it seems that no one was
sure about it until close to gradu-
ation time. ‘The the secret was out:
his big, ham-like hands were not
made for typing. He would try, but
aim as he would for one key, he
would hit another. At any rate, he
eraduated, and Riegel now makes
sure that his majors can type—and
does so in their sophomore years.

Chipley grew up in Lynchburg
and attended E. C. Glass High
School there. He went to Clemson
three years before he entered World
War Il as a Marine pilot. Again
in 1952-53 he was called to active
duty, and it was while he was on
duty in Florida that he met his wife,
the former Harriett Quillian of
Coral Gables.

As for prospects next year, Chip-
ley is not at all discouraged, but
he refuses to be optimistic. “If we
win three games we'll have a good
year,” he says.

In the meantime, he’s doing yeo-
man service by visiting alumni
meetings, helping the alumni to
better understand the University’s
new athletic program, and assuring
them that football still has a vital
role at Washington and Lee.

or study intended. This is the sec-
ond group of awards made under
the Glenn program which was es-
tablished in 1953 through a $120,-
ooo gift from the late philanthro-
pist. Mr. Glenn, for many years
an official of the Russell Sage
Foundation, received his master’s
degree from Washington and Lee
in 1879 and in 1907 was awarded
an honorary LL.D.

Prior to the establishment of the
Glenn Fund, similar grants-in-aid
were made possible by a $25,000
grant from the Carnegie Founda-

m DR. LUCIUS JUNIUS DESHA, Bayly
Professor of Chemistry and Pro-
fessor on the Thomas Ball Foun-
dation, will retire in June, becom-
ing professor emeritus.

Dr. Desha, who will have served
thirty-five years at Washington and
Lee University as professor of chem-
istry, also served as Dean of the Uni-
versity in 1946-47 and as Executive
Director of the University’s Bicen-
tennial Celebration from 1947 to
1949. His textbook on organic
chemistry, first published in 1936,
has been so widely used by leading
American colleges and universities
as to reflect great credit upon Wash-
ington and Lee. A second edition
has been recently published.

Dr. Desha is an alumnus of
Washington and Lee, receiving the
A. B. degree in 1906. He is a mem-

Desua—professor emeritus

ber of Phi Kappa Sigma social fra-
ternity and is also a member of
Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron Del-
ta Kappa. He received the Ph.D.
degree from Johns Hopkins in 1909.
Before returning to Washington
and Lee as a professor, Dr. Desha
taught at the University of ‘Ten-
nessee and at the College of Medi-
cine in Memphis. From 1917 to
1919 he was overseas in military
service. In addition to being chem-
istry department head, he was for
several years chairman of the Com-
mittee on Pre-medical Training.
Dr. and Mrs. Desha have lived for
many years on the Washington and

Lee campus. They have three
daughters, all of whom _ were
brought up  there—Mrs. Charles

Green, of Charlotte, North Caro-
lina, Mrs. Lucia Desha Gleason, of
Moorestown, New Jersey, and Mrs.
Charles Didier of Weston, Ohio.
Mrs. Desha, the daughter of Walter
S. Forrester, 82, was herself some-
thing of a campus child when, as
the granddaughter of Professor A.
L. Nelson, professor of mathemat-
ics at Washington and Lee, she
spent many summers in Lexington.
Dr. and Mrs. Desha are both Ken-
tuckians by birth, his original home
being Cynthiana, Kentucky, and
hers being Peewee Valley, a suburb
of Louisville. The Deshas now oc-
cupy the old Lee-Jackson House,

8

between the residences of President
Gaines and Dean Leyburn. ‘They
plan to move to their own home
at 323 South Main Street at the end
of the summer.

For many years Dr. Desha was
chairman of the Social Functions
Committee of the University, and
the Deshas have made a great con-
tribution to the success of Wash-
ington and Lee’s dances and other
social occasions.

It is the opinion of his associates
that the same painstaking care for
details which made Dr. Desha an
outstanding chemist, carried over
into his administrative work and
made him an excellent executive.
Of Dr. Desha’s contribution to
Washington and Lee, President
Gaines says:

“As a scholar of first-rate im-
portance, Dr. Desha has reflected
great credit upon this institution.
As professor and departmental
chief, he has maintained an in-

structional program of excellence.

As member of the academic com-
munity, he has rendered innumer-
able services of importance. He has
earned the admiration and the
gratitude of all who love Wash-
ington and Lee.”

=» Dr. EsmarcuH S. GILREATH, asso-
ciate professor of chemistry, has
been elevated to full professor and
designated to succeed Dr. L. J. De-
sha as head of the Department of
Chemistry at Washington and Lee.
Dr. Desha will retire in June and
become professor emeritus.

Gilreath came to Washington
and Lee in 1946 as an assistant
professor, after work as a research
chemist for the American Enka Cor-
poration at Enka, North Carolina.
He previously had taught at the
University of North Carolina and
in North Carolina high schools. He
was promoted to associate professor
IN 1952.

All of Gilreath’s education was
completed at the University of
North Carolina where he received
his A.B. in 1926, his M.A. in 1927,

and his Ph.D. in 1945. He recently
received additional recognition in
his field through the publication of
a college textbook entitled Qual-
itative Analysis Using Semi-Micro
Methods.

m ALMAND R. COLEMAN, professor
of accounting, has resigned from
the University family to accept ap-
pointment to a similar position at
the new _ established Graduate
School of Business Administration
at the University of Virginia. ‘The
School’s first class will enroll in
September of this year. Coleman, a
member of the Washington and Lee
faculty since 1939, has been on
leave of absence during the current
college year as a visiting professor
at the Harvard School of Business.
He was a visiting lecturer in busi-
ness administration at the Univer-
sity of Virginia last year.

A native of Smithfield, Virginia,
Coleman received a bachelor’s de-
gree from Washington and Lee in
1926 and the B.S. in commerce a
year later. He holds a master’s de-
sree in business administration
from Harvard and is a certified pub-

TRUSTEES

m A RESPECTED TRUSTEE emeritus,
William McChesney Martin, A.B.,
1895, died at a St. Louis, Missouri,
hospital on February 28, 1955. After
graduating here Mr. Martin re-
ceived the LL.B. degree from the
old St. Louis Law School, predeces-
sor of the Washington University
Law School, in 1900.

Mr. Martin became a member of
the Board of ‘Trustees of Washing-
ton and Lee in 1928, serving until
his retirement in 1949.

A native of Lexington, Kentucky,
Mr. Martin was associated with the
Mississippi Valley Trust Company
from 1900 to 1914, rising to vice-
president and _ general counsel.
When the Federal Reserve system
was inaugurated in St. Louis in
1914, he became chairman of the
board, retiring in 1941. A short

time later he announced he was

coming out of retirement to head
the law firm of Martin, Peper and
Martin, with which his son, Mal-
com, was associated. Another son,
William McChesney Martin, Jr.,
chairman of the board of the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of Washington,
was formerly president of the New
York Stock Exchange.

While a student here Mr. Martin
was editor of the Southern Col-
legian and valedictorian of his
class. He was halfback on the foot-
ball team for two years, and a mem-
ber of Sigma Nu social fraternity
and Phi Beta Kappa.

DEVELOPMENT

SSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS of the

University’s Development Pro-

gram are an understanding of the
University, and a sustained interest
in it, on the parts of both alumni
and parents of students. As aids in
developing this understanding and
interest, two new projects are in
their initial stages. |

The first relates to the alumni,
particularly to the members of the
class celebrating the 25th Anniver-
sary of its graduation. To mark
that significant milestone in a prop-
er manner, the University, on May

MARCH 1955

 

Athletic Committee.

 

Name Your Candidate

In compliance with Article 9 of the By-Laws of the Washing-
ton and Lee Alumni, Inc., we are listing below the names of the
Nominating Committee for the coming year. |

Under the By-Laws any member of the Association may submit
the names of alumni to fill the vacancies on the Alumni Board of
Trustees and for the alumni representatives on the University

‘There are three vacancies to be filled on the Alumni Board of
Trustees, and two on the Athletic Committee at the June, 1955,
meeting of the Alumni Association. Members of the Association
are urged to submit names of their candidates for these offices. ‘The
Nominating Committee will close its report on May 15.

The Committee is as follows: Emmett W. Poindexter, ’20,
Room 1201, 74 Trinity Place, New York 6, New York; ‘om Glas-
gow, 12, Box 1997, Charlotte, North Carolina; Barton W. Morris,
Jv.. 43, Times-World Corp., Roanoke, Virginia.

 

 

13 and 14 of this year, will be host
at the first (of what it is hoped will
become an annual event) 25-Year
Alumni Convocation and Reunion.
Members of the Classes of 19930,
both academic and law, have been
invited to return to the campus at
that time and to be guests of the
University while in Lexington.

‘The program is being planned to
give returning alumni an oppor-
tunity to renew acquaintances both
with their classmates and with the
University. Every effort will be
made to assure them of a good time,
and also to give them a comprehen-
sive view of the University as it is
in 1955. A series of discussions with
key members of the University’s
administration and faculty will be
scheduled, along with opportunities
to talk informally with other facul-
ty members and students and to
visit buildings and classes. High-
light of the program will be the
25-Year Convocation Address by
Dr. Gaines at noon on Saturday.
Activities will begin with a
luncheon on Friday and will.come
to a close following luncheon on
Saturday. Alumni and their wives
will be housed throughout their
stay at the Mayflower Hotel.

It is too early to predict the size

of such a gathering, but first in-
dications are that a sizeable group
will be returning in May.

a The 23rd of April will be an-
other significant day on the cam-
pus, for at that time the newly es-
tablished Parents’ Advisory Coun-
cil will hold its first meeting. Be-
cause alumni who have sons at the
University maintain their ties with
Washington and Lee through the
Alumni Association, the Parents’
Advisory Council is designed for
those parents who are not alumni
of Washington and Lee. It is be-
lieved that this new organization
will furnish valuable advice and
counsel as the University works (1)
to broaden the understanding
among non-alumni parents of the
University’s background, its pres-
ent work, and its future plans, (2)
to increase and sustain the inter-
est of non-alumni parents in Wash-
ington and Lee, and (3) to enlist
their guidance and support in con-
nection with the University’s con-
tinuing welfare and advancement.

ENROLLMENT
We AND LEE’s second

semester enrollment totals 987,
including 108 in the School of Law.

9

This total, which includes 28 new
students and returnees, compares
with 1,016 students enrolled at the
start of the first semester, and is 27
more than the corresponding en-
rollment a year ago. Graduation,
withdrawals, and academic failures
removed 57 names from University
rolls during the first half-year.

CURRICULUM

HE GROWING NUMBER and im-
Ga. of Congressional in-
vestigation committees has prompt-
ed a group of students, all of them
members of the political science
classes of Dr. J. Harvey Wheeler,
Jr., to draw up a petition request-
ing a joint committee on printing to
effect improvements in the typog-
raphy and format of the Congres-
sional reports in order to make
them more widely read and under-
stood by the general public. Wheel-
er emphasized that the project is
educational rather than political in
nature, and was formulated with
three special educational objectives
in mind: to teach students how
polling and public opinion inter-
views are conducted; to provide a
practical demonstration of the peo-
ple’s rights to petition Congress;
and to demonstrate the handling of
such petitions by the Nation’s elect-
ed lawmakers.

‘These investigations represent ex-
penditures of the taxpayer’s money,
but, Wheeler maintains, the re-
ports are so unattractively prepared
that the average citizen generally
is repelled by the small print and
stodgy format. As a consequence,
the work of these groups often goes
unreported to John Q. Public, save
for newspaper summaries.

The Bureau of Printing and En-
graving has informed Wheeler that
there has been no basic change in
typography since the first Congres-
sional report was published scores
of years ago.

To feel out Representatives and
Senators on the subject, students
first sent questionnaires to the legis-
lators asking for their opinions on
the appearance of reports and for

10

their attitude toward supporting a
petition for change. Some of the
more widely known and more influ-
ential leaders thave taken a_pro-
nounced interest in the program,
even to the extent of making in-
quiries of government printers on
the matter.

‘Then, to find out how the aver-
age citizen feels about the reports
as now printed, each student inter-
viewed five persons, who were se-
lected according to the random-
sample method of polling.

After all results have been tabu-
lated, the students will prepare a
petition, citing the background of
the survey and its findings. That
petition will request no new law,
but will simply call for a joint
resolution of the House and Senate
to set up a special sub-committee
of the Joint Committee on Printing
to study possible changes which will
make the reports more attractive
and readable.

m AN EXHIBITION of recent art by
young Americans was displayed in
the McCormick Library gallery for
a three-week period in January.
The paintings, obtained through
the Museum of Modern Art of New
York, included thirty works in oil,
watercolor, crayon, and pencil. Ab-
Stract, surrealist, and modern
French schools were represented.

m SECOND-SEMESTER journalism stu-
dents are again getting the benefits
of specialized instruction from
three visiting lecturers, two of them
veteran editors and the other an ex-
pert photographer. William Atkin-
son of the Roanoke Times, William
G. Leverty of the Richmond Times-
Dispatch, and VMI’s photographic
expert, Herbert Patchin, again com-
pose the staff of visiting teachers
who bolster the department during
the busy spring session.

Atkinson, manager of the Times,
comes to Lexington three times
weekly to conduct a class in copy-
editing. Since 1947 the has taught
students the skills of copy-reading,
headline-writing, and page lay-out.

Leverty takes time out once a
week from his duties as Times-Dis-
patch copy desk chief to conduct
a class in advanced reporting for
journalism seniors. Training fledg-
ling reporters is old hat to him, for
every man on the Richmond daily
undergoes a stint on his copy desk
before getting an assignment.

Patchin, besides being assistant
professor and director of physical
education at neighboring VMI, is
recognized as one of the state’s lead-
ing amateur photographers. His
weekly classes are designed to im-
part to students the basic camera
skills often demanded of all report-
ers by today’s newspapers. He
joined the visiting staff in 1949.

m THE FRANK FULLER FUND, which
provides journalism students with '
telegraphic news service 24-hours a
day, has been augmented by contri-
butions from thirteen Virginia and
District of Columbia newspaper
companies. The Fund was set up
under an initial gift of $500 from
the late Dr. Douglas Southall Free-
man, former editor of the Rich-
mond News-Leader. Its name is a
tribute from the Lee Memorial
Journalism Foundation to Frank
Fuller, who has been chief of the
Richmond Associated Press bureau
since 1927, for “high professional
and managerial achievement’ in
journalism. News received over the
AP wire is used by copy-editing and
page make-up classes in the jour-
nalism department, as well as by the
radio laboratory students who pro-
duce a fifteen-minute radio news
broadcast over Lexington Station
WREL five times a week.

Professor O. W. Riegel has also
announced a $500 gift to the jour-
nalism department from the Hobby
Foundation of Houston, Texas,
and gifts from three alumni, George
Benn Stott, Jr., ’48, of Bloomfield,
New Jersey; Harrison Kinney, ’47,
of New York City; and Henry F.
Arnold, ’33, of Cullman, Alabama.

LAW SCHOOL

ASHINGTON AND LEE’s Moot
W Court team, winner of the re-
gional Moot Court tournament at
Durham, North Carolina, (Alumni
Magazine, December, 1954), gained
greater distinction as it advanced
to the semi-final round in the
National Moot Court competition.
This competition, which consisted
of five rounds, involved partici-
pants from law schools all over the
Nation. Washington and Lee drew
a bye in the first round, eliminated
the University of Pittsburgh and
Georgetown University in the sec-
ond and third rounds, respectively,
and then lost to Columbia Univer-
sity by a narrow margin in the semi-
final argument. Columbia went on
to win the National Championship
by defeating the University of Ili-
nois in the fifth and final round.
The final argument was presided
over by Mr. Justice Felix Frank-
futer of the U. S. Supreme Court.

The Washington and Lee team
consisted of William M. Bailey of
Wilmington, Ohio, Willard I. Wal-
ker of Free Union, Virginia, and P.
James Kurapka of Baltimore, Mary-
land. And not to be overlooked is
the large contribution of William
B. Poff of Vicker, Virginia. As
chairman of the Moot Court Com-
mittee of the Student Bar Associa-
tion, he organized the competition

MARCH 1955

leading to the selection of Wash-
ington and Lee’s team and then
went on to serve the team as an able
research man.

‘This was the second year in which
Washington and Lee has partici-
pated in the national competition.
In an effort to have the University
well represented in coming years,
an energetic attempt is being made
to keep student interest in Moot
Court work at a high level.

s Melvin M. Belli, referred to ina
recent national magazine article as
the “King of Torts,’ was the guest
of the Student Bar Association in
February. In a talk before a large
audience of students and participat-
ing attorneys, he called for the con-
tinuance of trial by jury, rather
than trial by judicial commission, so
that a plaintiff will be compensated
adequately for injuries sustained.
Belli became nationally known
through his employment of black-
board demonstrative evidence and
medical cross-examination in per-
sonal injury trials. Heretofore such
evidence was restricted primarily
to criminal cases. His Modern
Trials, a three-volume set of books,
outlines the use of demonstrative
evidence in the court room.

A graduate of the University of
California’s School of Law in 1933,
Belli has his main office in San
Francisco with branch offices in Bev-
erly Hills, California, and Rome,
Italy. He is past president of the Na-
tional Association of Claimants and
Compensation Attorneys, and gen-
eral counsel for Japan Air Lines. He
has lectured to law schools, bar as-
sociations, and lawyers in forty-two
states, and at present is working in
cooperation with a doctor at Johns
Hopkins on another book, Forensic
Obstetrics, which will serve as a
guide for lawyers whose clients are
pregnant at the time of injuries.

The Virginia Bar Association, the
Roanoke, Richmond, Staunton,
Lexington, and Charlottesville Bar
Associations, and Student Bar As-
sociations at the University of Rich-
mond, William and Mary, and the

University of Virginia were also in-
vited to attend this lecture demon-
strating the methods used by a
plaintiff's attorney in a tort case.
‘The timing of Belli’s talk was for-
tunate, for Stanley C. Morris, presi-
dent of the International Associa-
tion of Insurance Counsels is ex-
pected to speak to the Washington
and Lee Student Bar Association
sometime in March, at which time
he will present the other side of
the case, that of the attorney for
the defense.

H THE HONORABLE Robert G. Storey,
Dean of the School of Law at
Southern Methodist University and
former president of the Amerti-
can Bar Association, will be the
speaker for the 1955 John Ran-
dolph Tucker Lectures to be held
on April 15th and 16th. The theme
for Dean Storey’s lectures: “Current
Peril of the Legal Profession.”

At noon on Friday, April 15, he
will discuss ‘““The Rule of Law and
Present Danger’; at eight o’clock
that evening his topic will be “The
Impact of Communism upon the
Legal Profession”; the final lecture
at noon on Saturday will consider
“Mobilization of the Legal Pro-
fession in the Age of Peril.” All
lectures will be in Lee Chapel.

‘The ‘Tucker Lecture series was
established in 1949 by the Board of
‘Trustees of Washington and Lee
in honor of the long and distin-
guished service of John Randolph
‘Pucker as Dean of the Law School.

UNDERGRADUATES

ELEGATES REPRESENTING nearly
D one hundred publications of
31 colleges and universities in the
Old Dominion assembled at Wash-
ington and Lee and Virginia Mili-
tary Institute in early March for
the 1955 Virginia Intercollegiate
Press Association Convention. The
Lexington colleges acted as co-hosts
for the event, the first held in Lex-
ington since 1950.

Some of the foremost experts in
newspaper and _ printing firms

11

in Virginia and North Carolina
judged publications, conducted cri-
tiques and seminars, and addressed
delegates. Representatives from vir-
tually all the editorial and business
staffs of Virginia college publica-
tions were in attendance.

Highlight of the convention was
the awards banquet at the Robert
E. Lee Hotel on the final night,
where outstanding college news-
papers, magazines, and yearbooks
were cited. At that time the Friday
Edition of The Ring-tum Phi was
named the best college newspaper
in the state. Professor O. W. Riegel
head of the University’s journal-
ism department, was the evening’s
principal speaker.

m AN EPISCOPAL BISHOP, the Right
Reverend William H. Marmion of
the Diocese of Southwestern Vir-
ginia, was the principal speaker and
discussion leader at the annual Re-
ligious Emphasis Conference in
February. Bishop Marmion opened
the two-day event at a University
assembly in Doremus Gymnasium.
His subject, “Peace of Mind or
Peace of God?” set the theme for
the conference, “Can Christianity
Be ‘Taken Seriously?”

The Religious Emphasis Con-
ference, which annually brings to
the campus outstanding ministers
of the eastern United States, is
conducted by the student Christian
Council with the assistance of Dr.
David Sprunt, University Director
of Religious Activities.

m A CAMPUS MINSTREL SHOW, the
first of its kind at the University
in recent years, was staged in the
‘Troubadour ‘Theater the last week
in February. ‘The show was a pro-
ject of the Student War Memo-
rial Scholarship Fund Committee,
which is now working on its second
$10,000 goal. ‘The committee, head-
ed by Joseph Pontius, of Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, went all-out in pro-
viding costumes and sets for the
production. Brian H. Shanley, a
senior from Morrison, Illinois, was
the interlocutor. End men were
Henry M. Ford, Jr., of Baltimore,

12

who directed the show; Roland C.
Davies, Jr., of Washington; Roger
P. Doyle, of Pensacola, Florida; and
Isaac N. Smith, of Charleston, West
Virginia. Shanley’s Southern Col-
legians, considered one of the best
Dixieland jazz combos in the state,
provided music for the show, while
a thirty-voice chorus under the d1-
rection of James W. Lewis, of
Irvington-on-Hudson, New York,
and a faculty quartet (Messrs. Bor-
den, Fishwick, Herbert, and Shil-
lington) furnished the songs.

BH FRATERNITY INITIATION week, com-
monly known as “Hell Week,”
ended Friday February 4 for some
240 freshmen pledges, who for the
preceding week had done every-
thing from running relay races be-
tween Lexington and Buena Vista
to scrubbing downtown sidewalks
with toothbrushes. ‘The Interfra-
ternity Council had attempted to
popularize the week as “Greek
Week” or “Help Week,” but for
the pledges, it was still the same old
“Hell Week.”

m PHI KAPPA PSI, oldest of Wash-
ington and Lee University’s 17 na-
tional Greek-letter social fraterni-
ties, celebrated the one hundredth
anniversary of its founding on the
campus February 25-27.

The event drew many alumni

from all walks of life back to the
University for the three-day cele-
bration. Highlight of the observ-
ance was a banquet Saturday eve-
ning at Natural Bridge where Lyle
W. Jones, national president of
Phi Kappa Psi, was the speaker.
_ The program included an open-
house reception for all Washington
and Lee students on Friday after-
noon at the Mayflower Hotel in
Lexington, a pre-banquet reception
at the fraternity’s house, and a Sun-
day buffet luncheon.

‘The fraternity was established at
Washington and Lee on March g,
1855, by Christian Wertenbaker.
Four of its chapter members joined
the Confederate Army upon leav-
ing the University, then known as
Washington College

The Chapter has been active
ever since, expect during war years.
It currently has a membership of
50 young men, and over 700 names
are recorded on its roll book.

‘The Chapter’s original charter is
intact, and the charter and other
documents of the early years are
regarded by the national head-
quarters as invaluable relics of the
organization’s history.

WINTER SPORTS

OT SINCE THE Football Gener-
N als went to the Gator Bowl
in 1950-51 has an athletic team at
Washington and Lee generated so
much student body enthusiasm as
has Coach Billy McCann’s §spar-
kling collection of freshmen and
sophomore basketballers.

It was common knowledge that
the squad was loaded with an ar-
ray of talented youngsters, but most
fans were looking to next year as
the very earliest they would have
anything to cheer about. ‘This sea-
son was supposed to be the build-
ing year, the series of tough games
against topflight opponents which
would give the green team the ex-
perience it would need for future
court campaigns.

The state press picked up this
general feeling, and = although
Coach McCann’s boys were absorb-
ing more than their fair share of
defeats during the early weeks, the
columnists began tagging the Gen-
erals as a “team of the future,” an
opinion based on the _high-scor-
ing antics of the improving Big
Blue team.

But the Generals upset the ma-
turity time-table in February when
they ripened far ahead of schedule
and closed the season by winning
10 of their last 12 contests. Includ-
ed were upset wins over Richmond,
until then unbeaten in state com-
petition in 31 straight games, Wil-
liam and Mary, and Virginia, and
an almost unbelievable come-from-
behind-victory over strong East
Tennessee State College.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

‘The McCann five, whose starting
combination was made up of four
sophomores and a freshman, cli-
maxed its regular season’s play
with a stirring revenge victory over
arch-rival Virginia, 98-89, in a jam-
packed Doremus Gymnasium.

By way of summary, here’s what
the Generals accomplished during
their 1954-55 regular season sche-
dule of 27 games:

@ Finished fourth in the Southern
Conference with eight wins and
five losses.

@ Finished third in the Virginia
Big Six with five wins, three losses.

¢ Finished the season with 15 wins
and 12 losses, for Washington and
Lee’s first winning year since
1946-47.

@ Averaged 84.3 points per game,
good enough to place them in the
top 15 major college teams in the
country in total offense. -

€ Made good on 835 field goals in
1,969 tries for 42.4 per cent ac-
curacy, again good enough for the
top 15 in major college circles.

¢ Scored more points in one season
than any other Generals’ five.

¢ Averaged more points per game
than any other Generals’ team.

@ Set a new school scoring record
with their season’s opener against
Bridgewater College, with a 119-
72 win.

@ Placed sophomore center Lee
Marshall on the first-team All-Big
Six squad, freshman guard Dom
Flora on the second team, and
sophomore forward Barclay Smith
on the third team.

Big man on Coach McCann’s
great young team was Marshall, the
6-5 center from Ashland, Kentucky,
who scored 571 points for an aver-
age of 21.1 per game. Showing vast
improvement in each game, the
blond sharpshooter hit on 51.7 per
cent of all his field goal tries and
ranked among the 20 best shots in
the nation.

No. 2 point-maker was the fresh-
man flash, Dom Flora, a 6-2 product

MARCH 1955

 

For Phi Kappa Psi, a centennial celebration—Speakers’ table guests included DEAN FRANK
J. GrtttAM; Mrs. CarroLut Evans, housemother; HOMER A. HOLT, ’18; Mrs. ROBERT W.
DickEy; E. STUART QUARNGESSER, Chapter President; and Miss Mary ANN HICKLIN.

of Jersey City, New Jersey. Flora’s
poise and ability seemed to bele
the fact that he still has three more
years to go. Having surpassed the
fabulous Jay Handlan’s freshman
scoring record 522 to 370, and aver-
aged over three points more than
did Handlan as a freshman, Flora
looms as the greatest threat to the
Wheeling Whiz’s four-year record
of 2,002 points.

Perhaps the most valuable but
yet most underrated man on the
team was a 6-3 sophomore, Barry
Storick, from Brooklyn. Storick
was consistently good for 10-plus
points per contest, but his true
value lay in his brilliant floor play
and uncanny rebounding ability.
Leader of the team in the latter
category, McCann often referred to
him as his “‘coach on the floor.”

Most improved of the starters
was Barclay Smith who developed
from an early season bench-warm-
er into the team’s top defensive
performer and a dangerous offen-
sive threat. In the post-exam period
when the Generals won 10 of 12
games, Smith averaged around 12
points a game and was accurate
on better than 55 per cent of his
shots from the floor.

The fifth regular was Milt Win-
awer, another Brooklyn sophomore
and the best passer on the team.
Winawer averaged better than

eight points a game, and he led
the team in assists—the passes that
pay off with two-points on the re-
ceiving end.

Although these five carried the
main load, it was a strong bench
that enabled the Generals to
weather many late-season storms.
Leading the first-line reserves was
Bob McHenry, a junior from
Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. A regu-

lar on last year’s five, McHenry’s

5-10 height caused him to lose a
starting role to his taller teammates.
But he was Coach McCann’s ace-
in-the-hole, and turned in consist-
ently good jobs while averaging
seven points a game. He has an-
other year to play.

By providing great clutch play
on occasion, two 6-4 freshmen,
Frank Hoss of Manassas, Virginia,
and Dave Nichols of Baltimore,
gave McCann much pleasure. Hoss
suffered an ankle injury in prac-
tice before the final game, after
playing his best game the previous
weekend against East Tennessee.
But Nichols took over his job of
spelling the big regulars, and
tossed in four field goals in five
tries against Virginia in the finale.

The Generals’ tough schedule
didn’t give the other reserves much
time for action, but they deserve
no less credit for the team’s fine
showing. Little Dick Skolnik, a 5-8

13

junior, played good ball in fre-
quent appearances at guard, while
freshman Buck Shulick and soph-
omore George Holbrook showed in-
dications of providing Coach Mc-
Cann with a powerful bench in
coming seasons.

m Although the basketball team was
the topic of most campus sports
conversation, the Generals fared
well in other winter athletics. Hav-
ing failed to compete in intercol-
legiate swimming the year before,
Cy Twombly’s mermen returned
this year to post a 4-3 record in dual
meets and to capture two Confer-
ence individual championships.
‘The swimmers defeated Catho-
lic University, Lynchburg College,
Randolph-Macon, and William and

WINAWER (16) hits against Richmond as StoricK (9), SKOLNIK (17), and MARSHALL stand by.

4

Mary, while losing to Virginia, VPI,
and Davidson. In the Southern
Conference meet at Davidson, soph-
omore Jay Fox of Bluefield, West
Virginia, won the 200-yard butter-
fly. His victory enabled Coach
Twombly to boast of having had
winners in all events in his years
of tournament competition.

‘The 300-yard medley relay team,
composed of Frank Kalmbach of
Shreveport, Louisiana, Fox, and
Bill Childs of the Belgian Congo,
won that event in the good time
of 3 minutes, 10.3 seconds.

m On the mats, the Generals again
failed to show the championship
form that once ruled at Doremus,
but the season was far from a
failure. Coach Dick Miller’s grap-

 

 

plers were winners four times, and
lost five, all of them to tough, rug-
ged opponents.

A winning season was in the mak-
ing until the final match of the last
dual contest with Virginia, when a
pin gave the Cavaliers a 16-14 edge.

The wrestlers won over Duke,
North Carolina, Davidson, and the
Citadel, while dropping matches to
VPI, Franklin and Marshall, Mail-
lersville (Pennsylvania), West Vir-
ginia, and Virginia.

Gibby McSpadden, a_ junior,
again proved to be the Generals’

top performer. Out of action in

the first three meets, the defending
167-pound Conference champion
defeated six opponents without a

~ loss, and he was favored to repeat

in the Conference tournament.

John Ellis, a 137-pound junior
from Leonia, New Jersey, won
eight and lost only one for the
second best record on the squad.
Bill Northrop of Alexandria, Vir-
ginia, at 157, and Dick Whiteford
of Baltimore, at 130, each won four
and lost five.

All in all, the winter sports pro-
gram was a real success, just as had
been the fall activities. Prospects
for spring sports are bright with
winning seasons anticipated in
golf, tennis, and lacrosse, while
track and baseball are in the re-
building stage.

Washington and Lee, with eleven
intercollegiate sports available to
its student body for competition,
offers the most well-rounded sports
program of any school in the South-
ern Conference, something of which
students, faculty, and alumni can

all be justly proud.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

We commend to your reading this

Statement from the Alumni Board of Trustees

be ALUMNI CHAPTERS and from
individual alumni the Alumni
Board of ‘Trustees has received vari-
ous resolutions and other expres-
sions, both verbal and written, con-
cerning (1) the University’s decis-
sions to discontinue further sub-
sidization of athletes and to sus-
pend intercollegiate football for
1954 and (2) certain other alleged
conditions relating to academic pol-
icles, procedures, or personnel on
the campus. The Board, therefore,
has undertaken to acquaint itself,
through its members, with the facts
relating to each area of concern.
Its study, involving no little expen-
diture of time on the part of its
members, has been as extensive as
possible, and has included individ-
ual discussions with alumni, fac-
ulty members, administrative off-
cials, students, and townspeople in
Lexington. In addition, the Alumni
Board on two occasions has met
Jointly with members of the Uni-
versity Board of Trustees to dis-
cuss these matters.

The first of these meetings took
place in Washington, D.C., on Oc-
tober 16, 1954. The Alumni Board
held its regular Fall meeting there
on that date for the express pur-
pose of accepting the invitation ex-
tended by the University Trustees
to meet jointly with them at lunch

and during the afternoon. At that.

time the Alumni Board expressed
to the University Trustees its re-
gret that decisions of such wide-
spread interest to alumni as the
suspension of football and the elim-
ination of further subsidization of
athletics were made and publicized
prior to any knowledge thereof by
the Alumni Board as a whole, and
without affording either the Alum-

MARCH 1955

ni Board or the alumni themselves
an opportunity to voice their opin-
ions.

‘The reasons for these decisions
were explained in detail to the
Alumni Board by the University
‘Trustees and by Dr. Gaines. In ad-
dition to this verbal explanation,
and in recognition of the interest
alumni have in intercollegiate ath-
letics, the Rector of the University,
Mr. James R. Caskie, subsequently
prepared a very detailed account of
the chronology of events leading
up to the football decisions, and the
more basic policy considerations
that entered into those decisions.
This account, entitled ““The Ath-
letic Decisions: Background and
Meaning” was published in the De-
cember, 1954, issue of The Alumni
Magazine for the information of all
alumni. The facts are as recorded
therein.

As the matter now stands, a new
policy has been adopted and a new
program is already being put into
effect. A seven-game football sched-
ule has been arranged for next
fall, and a small but excellent
coaching staff has been employed.
Scholarship requirements have been
liberalized to make the athlete with
good scholastic attainments more
eligible for assistance. These facts
were made clear at a special meet-
ing of the Alumni Board held in
Lexington on January 15, 1955, at
which time members again had an
Opportunity to discuss such matters
as they wished with the University
‘Trustees.

It is the earnest hope of the
Alumni Board of ‘Trustees that the
new athletic policy will prove suc-
cessful. It is our hope, too, that each
alumnus will place the best in-

terests of Washington and Lee
above what possibly may still be his
conflicting personal opinion with
regard to athletic policy, and will
continue to support wholeheartedly
the University’s athletic program.
Accordingly, the Board has desig-
nated Saturday, October 22, 1955,
as Homecoming Day, and urges that
alumni observe this day with the
same enthusiasm with which they
have welcomed Homecomings in
the past.

EGARDING ITS INQUIRIES into Cri-
R ticisms of academic policies,
procedures, or personnel, the Alum-
ni Board was quick to recognize
that matters of internal administra-
tive nature normally do not come
within its jurisdiction. However,
because of the nature of the many
allegations that have been made, be-
cause of the genuine concern to
which these allegations have given
rise among alumni, and because the
Alumni Board recognizes a respon-
sibility to those alumni, members of
the Board did make as thorough an
inquiry into these matters as was
possible. Having done so, it is the
Board’s considered opinion that
while certain of the criticisms may
have some factual foundation, none
of them constitute cause for alarm.
Moreover, the Board believes that
the resolution of these matters is
the province of the University’s ad-
ministration, and that they will be
resolved.

T THIS POINT it seems proper to
A consider the relationship of
the alumni to the University. The
Alumni Board believes that the
alumni role should be that of a

WILSON COMPTON*

President, Council for Financial Aid to Education

ou AND I and the millions of
Voie graduates in this coun-
try all are the beneficiaries of
an education at less than cost.
‘Today new and larger generations
are seeking the same kind of edu-
cational opportunity which we had.
But the gap between what a col-
lege education costs and what a
new generation of young people
can pay for it is gradually widening.
This gap may be narrowed by in-
creasing tuitions. But it may be
bridged only by gifts.

The question almost universally
asked by business concerns inter-
ested in principle in financial aid
to higher education is: what are the
colleges doing to help themselves?
‘This means: have they looked their
educational programs “‘squarely in
the eye’—and their business man-
agement, too? What are they doing
or proposing to do for their teach-
ers? Are they seeking the help of
their immediate constituents, in-
cluding their own trustees, the par-
ents of their students, the commun-
ity, and the church, if church-re-
lated? If they need financial aid
from the public, are they making
their financial statements public?
Are they seeking public confidence
through a policy of “openness?” But
a vital part of this question is: what
are the alumni doing to help? Some
colleges and universities can now
answer that question well, some
poorly, and some not at all.

Interested corporations want to
know that the colleges and univer-
sities in which they invest are do-
ing—or at least are capable of do-
ing—work of good quality, and
have at least the “seeds of great-
ness” which should be in every
school which undertakes the re-
sponsibility of teaching young peo-

16

ple. Businessmen generally know
that the American colleges and uni-
versities are a cornerstone of our
economic and political liberties and
an indispensable source of the man-
agement, professional and _ techni-
cal skills without which business it-
self cannot prosper. The interest of
businessmen, accustomed to the ma-
jor vices of competition in their
own enterprises, and seeking these
virtues and vices in education as
well, is attracted instinctively to the
idea of helping those institutions
which are doing the best they can
to help themselves.

Alumni giving, in this sense the
“seed money” of business giving,
is at the heart of the ftund-rising
prospect of each college and univer-
sity which is looking to the future.
If the alumni will help, business
will help. For both understand
that: What happens to American
education will eventually happen
to America.

He stated that the alumni them-
selves must be the cornerstone of a
successful Development Program.
They must, through their efforts
and their funds, give a strong an-
swer to the key question posed by
corporations, foundations, and in-
dividuals outside the University
family who are asked to assist Wash-

LYNCHBURG

Bill Chipley, football coach, and
Dr. Marvin B. Perry, professor of
English, were the principal speak-
ers at the annual banquet of the
Lynchburg Chapter of Washington
and Lee alumni, held at the Boons-
boro Club on Friday evening, Feb-
ruary 23, with 75 alumni and their
wives in attendance.

Chipley stated that the end of
football subsidization at Washing-
ton and Lee has brought an im-
proved and healthy spirit to the
student body. Good prospects who
had been at the University for two
years, but had not played football,
were among the 48 who appeared
for spring practice February 1. He
made it clear that last summer the
school ‘‘suspended”  varsity-level
football, but did not “quit,” and
that next season’s team will “rep-
resent the Washington and Lee
student body and will play teams
that represent their student bodies.”

Chipley appealed for alumni sup-

port for the new program and said
future plans call for an increase
in endowment to enable at least 20
per cent of the student body to re-
ceive some scholarship aid, but this
aid will be for all-round ability and
not primarily for athletic prowess.

Dr. Perry spoke with infectious
enthusiasm of present conditions at
the University, making a thought-
ful and exciting presentation of
progress and activities, praising the
“personalized teaching” of small
classes in which the faculty mem-
bers are interested in the develop-
ment of the individual. He also
spoke of the scholarship aid to de-
serving and promising boys, who
otherwise could not have the bene-
fit of education at Washington and
Lee.

Outgoing President Elliot Schew-
el introduced Earl Wingfield, en-
thusiastic supporter of the Wash-
ington and Lee football team for
many years, who was given a cer-
tificate as an honorary member of

Fighty-three alumni and guests

Washington and Lee Alumni, on
February 22, with Thomas R. Wat-
kins, ’48, president of the chap-

Parke S. Rouse, Jr., ’37, of Wil-

P. Gaines, President of the Uni-
versity, who spoke on this anni-
versary celebration of the birthday
of General George Washington,
one of the early benefactors of the
University which bears his name.

Dr. Gaines said that Washing-
ton’s greatest desire was to be “a
good Virginia farmer,’ but “had
he heeded his desire, how different
out Nation would be.” Dr. Gaines
urged the alumni to “forget the
yardstick of our own student days”
in appraising the current college
situation. He said probable inter-
ruption for military service and
such factors as the H-bomb require
present students to “carry burdens
and face anxieties and unpredict-
ables unknown in previous times.”

Reporting on the situation at
Washington and Lee, Dr. Gaines
praised benefactors, alumni and
faculty as well as students. He spoke
briefly on the federation of 12 pri-
vately endowed schools which make
joint appeals for corporate support.
He noted that in the last 18 months,
70 corporations have donated $250,-
ooo to this fund.

Reporting that 450 prospective
students were refused admission at
Washington and Lee last year, Dr.
Gaines said, “we won’t do a second-
rate job for a large student body;
we will do a first-rate job for a
small number.” The current enroll-
ment 1S 1,000.

William <A. (Bill) Chipley, °409,
making his first appearance before
an alumni group since his appoint-
ment as head football coach on in-
vitation and gave a full explana-
tion of Washington and Lee’s new
athletic policy. Chipley said he was
in complete accord with the Uni-
versity’s de - emphasis program.
Washington and Lee, he said, could
not afford financially to subsidize
football to the extent other Vir-
ginia colleges are doing, even if it
wanted to try.

Instead, said the former AIl-
Southern end at Washington and
Lee, the University is trying to give
the game “back to the players,”
putting consideration
first and intercollegiate athletics
in their proper place.

‘The new coach, who succeeded
Carl Wise, said the 1955 Generals
“will hold their own” with next
fall’s opponents. ‘These opponents,
making up a seven-game schedule,
were chosen, he declared, not on a
basis of size but on having the same
attitude toward football as Wash-
ington and Lee. He said he has
some 40 boys out for spring football

academic

practice, among them five or six
standouts “who could play on any
team in the state.”

He invited the alumni to en-
courage boys with athletic ability, .
who could meet the academic stand-
ards, to come to Washington and
Lee.

A motion by Earl A. Fitzpatrick
and seconded by Richard T. Ed-
wards, was made and carried, to
give the University and Chipley a
strong vote of confidence. Copies
of the resolution will be sent to
the University’s board of trustees
and the alumni board of trustees.

H. K. (Cy) Young, alumni secre-
tary, told the group the University
hopes in the future to make avail-
able endowed scholarships to young
men with better than average scho-
lastic ability, plus athletic prowess,
who would not be able to attend
college otherwise.

WASHINGTON

More than one hundred alumni
of the Washington, D.C. area and
their wives met at the Chevy Chase
Club for the chapter’s annual din-
ner, at which Fred Vinson, ’46,
president of the chapter, presided.
Honored guests of the occasion
were Mrs. Woodrow Wilson and
Mrs. Bolling Lee. President Gaines
was the principal speaker of the
occasion. Bill Chipley, ’49, football
coach, spoke briefly on the new ath-
letic policy and prospects for the
1955 football team.

In his talk Dr. Gaines reported
on present conditions on the cam-
pus and gave special emphasis to
the University’s fulfillment of its
fine heritage; General Washing-
ton’s sense of devotion to dutv and
General Lee’s great faith.

At the close of the meeting Brian
Bell, ’49, on behalf of the local
chapter, presented Dr. and Mrs.
Gaines with a handsome
serving tray.

Officers elected to serve for the
coming year were Lynwood King,

A Letter

from

General Lee

Psychologists and educators, usually after scientific
research and investigation, frequently give advice or
advance theories concerning the proper method of
handling children and of providing for their educa-
tion. In the letter below General Robert E. Lee has
a message on the subject based on his own “reflection
and experience” which will apply to our generation
as well as his.

In the years after the war General Lee was the
most influential man in the South, and his corres-
pondence shows that thousands sought his advice on
many subjects. The Educational Association of Vir-
ginia, in which Lee took a keen interest, sought to
enlist his aid and influence with “the public and par-
ents of Virginia.” The letter explains itself. The origi-
nal in Lee’s autograph is in the John B. Minor Col-
lection, Alderman Library, University of Virginia. A
copy retained by Lee is in the General’s Letter Book,
No. 4, Manuscript Division, Library of Congress.

—ALLEN W. MOGER

 

Lexington, Va., 17 Jany. 1867
Prof. J. M. Minor
University of Virginia
Albermarle Co., Va.

My Dear Sir:

I have been informed by the Corresponding Sec-
retary of the Educational Society of Va. that I have
been appointed in conjunction with yourself & the Rev.
Dr. Dabney, a committee to prepare an address to the
public & parents of Va., urging them to a more hearty
cooperation with teachers in matters of instruction,
discipline &c. ‘The benefits that would be secured to
education and the aid which would be afforded teach-
ers by such cooperation, would be very great; as all
who have any experience on the subject must be aware
of the obstacles at the very threshold of education, aris-
ing from want of proper family management. If, there-
fore, they can be removed, much good will be attained;
and this result can in some degree be accomplished by
inducing parents to consider the fundamental prin-
ciples to be observed in the education of their chil-
dren.

In its broad and comprehensive sense, education
embraces the physical, moral and intellectual instruc-
tion of a child from infancy to manhood. Any system
is imperfect which does not combine them all; and
that is best which, while it thoroughly develops them,
abases the coarse animal emotions of human nature
& exalts the higher faculties and feelings. A child
has everything to learn, & is more readily taught by
having before it good examples to imitate, than by
simple precepts. He should, therefore, as far as cir-
cumstances will permit, be encouraged to associate
with his parents; for his heart must be affected, his
feelings moved, as well as his mind expanded. He
may be taught that it is criminal to steal, & sinful to
lie, & yet be unable to apply this knowledge to the
government of himself; and it will therefore be of no
value to him unless the principle is confirmed into a
habit.

Obedience is the first requisite in family training.
It should be made sincere & perfect, & to proceed as
much from affection as a conviction of its necessity. To
accomplish this, great prudence and the exercise of
much patience are necessary. By firmness mixed with
kindness, the child by repeated experience will learn
that he is not to follow his first impulse, and that
self control, which even an infant can understand, is
necessary to his comfort. Neither violence nor harsh-
ness should ever be used, and the parent must bear
constantly in mind, that to govern his child, he must
show him that he can control himself. One of the
most common errors in the management of children
is irregularity of behavior towards them. They are as
skilful as pertinaceous in their attempts to gratify their
self will; at one time trying to evade authority, at an-
other, to oppose it. If they once succeed, they are en-
couraged to persevere; and it is necessary for the par-

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

ent to meet the first attempt with firmness, and not
permit himself to be baffled either by evasion or
resistance. Although a child may not yield to threats
and may defy punishment, he cannot resist patient
kindness and gentle admonition.

‘The love of truth is equal in importance to habit-
ual obedience. Every encouragement, even to the
pardoning of offences, should be given to its cultiva-
tion. Children are naturally truthful, and they should
be accustomed to hear the truth always spoken; and
candor, integrity and confession of error, with a destes-
tation of falsehood, dishonesty and equivocation
should be sedulously inculcated. A strict adherence to
promises made to them is of the utmost importance
as well as the removal of all temptation to misconduct.
‘They should also be prepared and warned against its
attacks.

Sentiments of religion should be early impressed
upon the minds of children by personal explanation
& systematic instruction. As the intellect expands, its
sacred truths will be comprehended & felt, and its
motives and principles be strengthened & confirmed
by practice & habit. An essential part of the education
of youth is to teach them to serve themselves, and to
impress upon them the fact that nothing good can
be acquired in this world without labor, & that the
very necessaries & comforts of life must be procured by
earnest & regular exertion. hey should also be taught
to know that after having been reared and educated by
their parents, they should not expect them to further
provide for them, & that their future subsistence and

advancement must depend upon themselves. Parents
sometimes commit the mistake of allowing their
children after having reached the period of life when
they ought to be engaged in making a livelihood, to
rely upon them for support. This encourages them
in injurious idleness, & destroys that spirit of self de-
pendence which is necessary for their advancement in
life, and causes them to appear so unreasonable as to
depend upon them, after having arrived at the age of
being able to think and act for themselves.

‘The choice of a profession is not of so much conse-
quence as the manner in which it is pursued. If
habits of self control and self denial have been ac-
quired during education, the great object has been
accomplished. Diligence and integrity in any useful
pursuit of life will be sure to secure prosperity & fame;
and success will result from engaging in that business
in which the generality of mankind are interested.

I have given you the foregoing sketch of what I
have thought might form in part the groundwork of a
suitable address, to be modified or suppressed as you
and Dr. Dabney may determine. As I have no know-
ledge of the views of the Educational Society as to the
kind of address that is desired, I must leave to you two
its preparation; as J am sure you will do it more satis-
factorily than I could.

What I have written is derived from my reflection
and experience.

Very respectfully & truly yours
R. E. Lee

 

 

About the University
(Continued from page 4)

differing opinions of its individuals
and groups.

In addition, there seem to me two
valuable by-products of these recent
crises: (1) they have made us real-
ize our failure to keep alumni sufh-
ciently well-informed and _ inter-
ested in Washington and Lee’s total
program; and (2) we have been
made to reassess and rethink our
ideas of Washington and Lee’s real
mission and significance: education,
the best in depth and breadth that
we can devise, for the whole man.
We have been reminded that our
chief function, the one which we
cannot delegate to other worthy in-
stitutions (the church, the home,
the club or fraternal group) is the
training of men’s minds. Other
things are tremendously import-
ant—character, skills, friendships—

MARCH 1955

but our unique function in our so-
clety is intellectual training. I do
not believe that in carrying out
this purpose at the University today
we are neglecting other important
aspects of the whole man.

HAVE SAID THAT we are enthus-
I iastic and optimistic. But there
are problems to be faced, too, and
I would not be giving you an ac-
curate picture if I did not at least
mention some of them briefly.
_ They stem chiefly, I think, from
the increasing expense today of the

kind of education which Washing-

ton and Lee has been committed
to for over 200 years: personal
teaching of highly selected young
men, in small classes, by teachers of
ability and character; the training
of young men for leadership in an
increasingly complex, highly com-
petitive society, in a tension-ridden
world, in a scientific and industrial

age which is now realizing afresh
the importance, the desperate need,
of humane learning, of responsible
freedom, of the inseparability of in-
tellect and morality.

Washington and Lee is deter-
mined to continue that kind of
education, costly as it is, because it
is needed and important, because
there are relatively few institutions
where such education is still of-
fered, because we believe it incul-
cates best those humane values we
consider essential to our society’s
health and survival.

We want to get the best students
we can find, and to give them the
best teachers, the best equipment
and tools we can assemble. These
are big orders: students, teachers,
equipment; and the first two, the
human elements, are the most im-
portant, the most difficult to get.

‘There is an increasing competi-

21

tion for students, for the most
gifted, the best-rounded graduates
of our high and preparatory schools.
Here we are at a disadvantage in
two “leagues”: (1) the state univer-
sities (especially for state students),
and (2) the heavily endowed un1-
versities and colleges, many of
which are our natural competitors.
The state schools are less expensive
in both tuition and other expenses.
‘The best independent schools have
heavy scholarship endowments
which can often guarantee a good
boy, if admitted, complete freedom
from financial worry for his four
years. Washington and Lee, which
has a tuition of about $600 and an
annual expense to each boy of
about $1,250 (not counting social
life), has no scholarships which
reach $1,000 and few which even
approach that figure. High as it is,
our $600 tuition covers only about
60 per cent of Washington and
Lee’s yearly educational expenses
per student. Washington and Lee’s
annual income from scholarships
is only about $38,000. Fortunately,
additional endowment for scholar-
ship awards is one of the top priori-
ties in the Development Program.

Aside from the loss of many good
men who cannot afford to come
here, the boys who do come are
perhaps affected in that the student
body is in danger of becoming nar-
row in terms of economic back-
ground. One of Washington and
Lee’s sources of pride is the large
number of ministers, missionaries,
doctors, successful business men
who came here as boys of limited
means. We need men of that type
in our student body. We do not
want to be known as a “rich man’s
school.” Like most colleges, we
would like to draw equally from
private and public schools.

But money aside, we need more
good men. Alumni can certainly
help in this field, and they do. I
would cite two fine examples: the
Baltimore Alumni Chapter, which
has a vigorous and enthusiastic stu-
dent recruiting program, sent us
27 freshmen this year; and the

99

Northern Ohio Chapter, which
sends us five or six men a year, is
equally alert in this field. ‘The latter
chapter uses two-man committees
to cover each preparatory school in
its territory.

‘The future, of course, in terms of
the number of applicants is bright.
You have heard much of the pre-
dicted flood of college students to
hit the schools by 1960. That will
help us, give us greater selectivity;
it should mean better students, not
more, for we want to stay at about
our present size.

Increasing costs also pose a big
faculty problem. We must have
adequate salaries—adequate to in-
sure a man a fair living wage, rea-
sonable economic security, oppor-
tunity to educate his children, and
the means to live comfortably if
modestly. ‘hey must be adequate
also to compete successfully with
other institutions of our caliber
which are bidding for teachers’ ser-
vices, to keep our men and to get
competent new ones as the need
arises. Needless to say, I am de-
lighted that faculty salaries are also
a top priority in our Development
Program. And I think these priori-
ties, for good students and for good
teachers, are a significant commen-
tary on what Washington and Lee
considers essential to its job. Could
there be two more important in-
gredients for a great college?

We have other problems, too.
What growing, © forward-looking
organization has not? I shall men-
tion merely a few of which we are
particularly aware: (1) the Library
needs additional funds for books,
personnel, and equipment; (2) “‘hell
week” excesses in fraternity initia-
tion are a concern of student lead-
ers as well as the University’s facul-
ty and administration; (3) there are
too many sophomore academic fail-
ures; (4) modern equipment and
additional space are needed for our
laboratory sciences; (5) we lack eat-
ing, living, and social facilities for
non-fraternity men. ‘These prob-
lems are a few of the many that
have been brought out in the recent

intensive self-examination survey
conducted for the Development
Program by committees made up of
members of the faculty, administra-
tion, student body, and the Board
of ‘Trustees.

But it would not be accurate for
me to conclude on a dark note, for
all of us agree, I believe, that our
many advantages and our strengths
and achievements far outweigh our
needs and our shortcomings. It is
in that conviction that we in Lex-
ington are looking ahead with con-
fidence and enthusiasm. We feel
that you share our feelings, and we
feel our great responsibilty to you
to keep you informed, to give you
the facts so that your enthusiasm
and affection, your admiration for
Washington and Lee, can have a
sound, confident basis.

You will hear shortly of the Uni-
versity’s plans for the first of its an-
nual 25-year Convocations and Re-
unions, when the class celebrating
the 25th anniversary of its gradua-
tion from the University will be in-
vited to return to Lexington as
guests of the University. This will
take place in May. It will be a re-
union, yes; but it will be more than
just a reunion. In addition to see-
ing old friends and much-loved
scenes, returning members of the
25-year class will have the oppor-
tunity to see the University in ac-
tion—through special exhibits, pan-
el discussions, faculty and student
speakers, athletic and social events,
actual classroom teaching.

By such gatherings we can get
away from impersonal abstractions
like “the faculty” or “the alumnv’
and come to think increasingly of
each other as individuals who are
bound together by a common af-
fection and admiration for one of
the great American colleges. Like
you, we in Lexington mean to keep
it great. I assure you we are very
conscious and proud of Washing-
ton and Lee’s great past, and our
present concerns and actions are
shaped, like yours, by a devotion
which is non incautus futuri—“‘not
unmindful of the future!”

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

Uncle Sam,

Honorary Alumnus

CHARLES A. STRAHORN, ’25

THIS Is A sToRY of three loyal
and generous alumni—who for
sake of anonymity we will call
Able, Baker, and Charlie. All three
were most generous with their
worldly goods, and especially so
when Washington and Lee ap-
pealed for financial aid.

Able was requested to head up
a fund drive for the old college.
Being of modest means, he decided
to form a committee and enlist as-
sistance from a couple of fellow
alumni, Messrs. Baker and Charlie.

At the first committee meeting,
called by Able, the three met, as
arranged at Charlie’s club for cock-
tails and dinner. Baker arrived late,
but apoligized by saying he had
been reading up on the new Inter-
nal Revenue Code—a requirement
of his profession. Baker allowed as
how he had figured something. out
of the 1954 Act which would make
Uncle Sam pay for their dinner,
and enhance the coffers of Wash-
ington and Lee. In that case, Able
and Charlie said, “‘Let’s have an-
other cocktail and proceed.”

Conversation developed the fol-
lowing facts:

For income tax purposes Able
and Baker claimed they were in
the 22 per cent income tax bracket.
Charlie said he was more fortunate,
or less, depending on who was talk-
ing, and that his highest bracket
was 44 per cent.

All three stated they itemized
their deductions, and none used the
standard deduction, since their in-
comes and total deductions and
size of family and other considera-
tions made it the best course.

MARCH 1955

Upon questioning, Able stated
he could give only $50.00 to W&L
this year; Baker said he could give
$100.00; and Charlie said the max-
imum he could donate was $150.00.
‘This made a total of $300.00 from
three alumni—maybe a good aver-
age, but not enough to endow the
University heavily.

‘The Committee wanted to do
more personally, so this is what
they decided to do:

Because Able’s $50.00 donation
would reduce his income tax only
$11.00 (22 per cent), and Baker’s
$100.00 donation would reduce his
only $22.00 (22 per cent), the two
of them decided to give their com-
bined $150.00 to Charlie on the
condition that he would donate a
total of $300.00 to W&L. The total
of $300.00 would reduce Charlie’s
tax $132.00 (44 per cent), which is
twice as much as his own $150.00
donation would have cut his in-
come tax ($66.00). Thereby Charlie
gains clear a total of $66.00.

Because he is a good guy Charlie
splits the $66.00, and gives $11.00
back to Able, $22.00 to Baker. This
leaves him $33.00 clear.

 

Your Class Agent wants
to hear from you. Please
reply to his letter. Make
your gift to the 1954-55

Alumni Fund now.

 

Able and Baker then convince
Charlie he should give this remain-
ing $33.00 to W&L, to which he
assents, and he get an additional
$14.52 tax savings (44 per cent of
$33.00).

Charlie says O.K., and for the
suggestion he says he will pay for
the drinks and the dinner with the
$14.52 the suggestion saved him. So
he signs the check at his club.

Able was the poorest one of the
three, but game, and said he would
kick in his $11.00 which Charlie
gave him back, if Baker would
kick back the $22.00 he got from
Charlie, and thus raise the total take
of W&L to $366.00 cash money.

Baker was willing, but being a
tax accountant who had _ just
studied the new law, told Charlie
to get a receipt from the Club for
the $14.52 check he signed, claim
it as a fund-raising expense and
show it as having been donated to
W&L—even though the University
got no cash from this phase. How-
ever, Charlie got another 44 per
cent or $6.38 tax saving!

After several more drinks the
“Committee” decided to get a taxi
and go home—and do you know
what happened?

Because they lived out in the
suburbs, the taxi fare was pretty
steep—over $5.00! Able, the poorest,
dished it out and gave the driver
a $2.26 tip—to the penny—for a
total cab fare of $7.26. Bur UNCLE
SAM PAID IT! WuHy?

Able saved $2.42, or 22 per cent
of his own direct contribution to
the University of $11.00, and Baker
cut his income tax $4.84, or 22 per
cent of his own direct contribution
of $22.00—total savings for the
pair of $7.26.

Shall we have another fund
raising party? Some wise guy will
say the taxi fare is deductible under
the new law, and it probably is,
but we had better stop some place,
or maybe Uncle Sam will plug up
the loophole and refuse to become
an honorary Washington and Lee
Alumnus!
