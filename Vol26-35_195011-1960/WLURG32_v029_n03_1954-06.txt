THE UNIVERSITY

m READERS OF THE NATION’S morning
newspapers were greeted in early
June by front-page headlines an-
nouncing that fifteen undergradu-
ates at Washington and Lee, some
of them athletes, had withdrawn
from the University for violation
of the Honor System. ‘The press re-
ported factually the “straight from
the shoulder’ story that had been
dispatched by University officials
in a sincere endeavor to lay all of
the facts before the public in lieu
of the inevitable distortions that
otherwise would result from rumor
and half truths.

Details of this unhappy episode
were known to only a few on cam-
pus prior to the appearance of Stu-
dent Body President William M.
Bailey before a special assembly.
There he announced that the stu-
dent body’s Executive Committee
had been investigating since last
April possibilities of organized
cheating among a small segment of
the student body. Bailey called it

2

a “syndicate,” and said that inves-
tigations had revealed that the stu-
dents involved had obtained ad-

vance copies of quizzes and exami-
nations by using pass keys. In ad-
dition to two master keys, the
“syndicate” had in its possession
others which would open all profes-
sors’ offices in Robinson, Washing-
ton, Payne, Newcomb, and Reid
Halls, the office of the superinten-
dent of buildings and grounds,
where keys to all University build-
ings are kept, and both the mime-
ograph office and the filing cabinet
in that office in which all quizzes
and examinations are stored prior
to being picked up by professors.

Bailey said that all of the stu-
dents who had withdrawn had
known fully of the student-held
keys, and either had received ad-
vance copies of quizzes or examin-
ations through the use of the keys,
or had gone into offices and ob-
tained quizzes or examinations, or
had stood guard while others did so.
He added that when advance copies

 

were unobtainable, some of the stu-
dents had entered professors’ offices
after the quizzes had been given and
had substituted an improved set of
answers for those they wrote during
the quiz.

To consider the cases which de-
veloped from its long investigation,
the Executive Committee was in
almost constant session for four
days. Nearly all of the students
implicated withdrew voluntarily,
rather than stand trial. All of them
signed written depositions admit-
ting the part they had played in
the “syndicate.”

One night watchman was also in-
volved and has been dismissed from
University employ.

Visibly shaken by the events that
had transpired in recent days,
Bailey went on to say that the sit-
uation has “more potential for
good than... for harm,” and em-
phasized that each member of the
student body must be willing to
shoulder his own responsibilities
under the Honor System, the most

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

 

onerous of which is the reporting
of student violations of the system.
“Without that,’ he said, ‘the
Honor System becomes a shield of
the guilty and the betrayer of the
innocent.”

In a letter to the Executive Com-
mittee, Dr. Gaines commended that
body for its “courage and devotion”
in bringing this existing situation
into a clear and open light. “The
administrative officials,’ he said,
“will cooperate fully in an attempt
to remove any existing factors. of
whatever nature that might make a
recurrence of this story possible...
[They] pledge full support of those
officers whom the students of this
University choose as their duly
elected leaders.

“In behalf of all of us I offer a
prayer that this episode will not
shake our faith in the Honor Sys-
tem of our University but will be
an occasion for us to rededicate
ourselves to the noble and com-
manding ideal which is the strength
of this system.”

Although the entire University
community deplores the fact that a
few have taken their honor pledges
lightly, it takes pride in another
fact, that violations can come forci-
bly to light only where there is an
Honor System, and where the over-
whelming majority unite in a com-
mon effort to maintain it in work-
ing order. As Dr. Gaines com-
mented later, “The fact that the
student body when informed of this
story gave to the Executive Commit-
tee a standing ovation is certain
proof that our student sentiment is
healthy.”

m THE UNIVERSITY has been advised
by the publishers of Who’s Who in
America that in their current
volume Washington and Lee stands
among the top fifteen independent
institutions of the nation. The word
“independent” as here used in-
cludes all colleges that are not tax-
supported. Standing is determined
by the number of graduates listed
in Who’s Who in proportion to the
total number of graduates. In the
South, the University is exceeded

JUNE 1954

only by Vanderbilt in the aggregate
number of names, but in the pro-
portion indicated above Washing-
ton and Lee leads.

DEVELOPMENT

m IN PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS of the
University’s Development Program,
mention has been made of its three
phases: (1) a self-study to determine
just what the University’s present
and future needs are, (2) a con-
structive analysis of the University’s
relations, present and future, with
its various publics, and (3) the
fund-raising efforts which the Uni-
versity will undertake in an attempt
to satisfy its needs. Timing called
for completing the first two phases
prior to the close of the 1953-54
college year. Except for one or two
areas in which studies must be con-
tinued, this deadline has been met,
and members of the University’s
Board of Trustees have received
for their perusal and action a full
report of the findings and recom-
mendations of seven development
committees.

It is hoped that with the coming
of fall, fund-raising activities of a
more widespread nature can be un-
dertaken. Two important steps,
once taken, will make that possible:
approval by the Board of the needs

In front of Lee Chapel, a Lincoln

which the Development Program
will seek to satisfy, and selection of
the final members to serve on the
University Development Council,
followed by the initial meeting of
that group. The Development
Council will have authority over
all University fund-raising pro-
grams not assigned to the Alumni
Fund Council, including those con-
cerned with corporations, founda-
tions, parents, friends, and estate-
planning. In the meantime the De-
velopment Office is concentrating
on details of the various fund-rais-
ing programs, which will be pre-
sented to the Development Council
for its consideration. Also, it con-
tinues to collect the large amounts
of data that will be necessary to
make the fund-raising programs
possible.

Working in close cooperation
with the Alumni Office, the De-
velopment Office has been engaged
actively in the operation of the
annual Alumni Fund. ‘The reason
is sound. ‘The success of the De-
velopment Program will be influ-
enced considerably by the degree
to which alumni give evidence, via
time, energy, interest, and funds,
of their continued concern for the
welfare of Washington and Lee. It
is they who attended the Univer-
sity, and should know it best. It is

 

One of the surprise features of the Alumni Reunion was this gift to DR. GAINES—a 1954
Lincoln Capri. A token of alumni esteem, it was presented by Association President
WILLIAM L. WEBsTER, ’12, (right) to mark the beginning of his 25th year as President.

MEDINA—To his appraising eye, justice is big business

they who profited from the Uni-
versity’s educational program and
should be the first to give evidence
of their desire to have Washington
and Lee continue as a top-ranking
institution of learning. And it is
they who should recognize the value
of continuing independently sup-
ported higher education in our
society. ‘Those from the non-alum-
ni ranks who are asked to assist in
achieving University goals may
very properly ask what Washing-
ton and Lee’s alumni are doing to
help. If the answer is a thoroughly
favorable one, the University’s case
will be strengthened immeasurably.

LAW SCHOOL

m A PLEASANTLY be-mustached man
of medium build stepped to the
speaker’s stand and smiled impishly
while the capacity audience in Lee
Chapel applauded enthusiastically.
Although he had a prepared talk
on the stand in front of him, he
quickly explained that he had no
intention of confining himself to a
written address. As a matter of
fact, he laughingly said, he had
asked Dr. Gaines to allow him to
speak off the cuff, but he wouldn't
hear of it.

‘The occasion for this generous
applause and insistence upon a
written address was the John Ran-
dolph ‘Tucker lectures. And the

4

person responsible for making this
year’s series of more interest, per-
haps, than any of the other five that
preceded it was Federal Judge
Harold R. Medina. Widely known
and highly respected by his col-
leagues in the field of litigation, Me-
dina is also well known to laymen,
largely by virtue of his brilliant
handling of the difficult trial of
eleven Communist leaders in 1949.

Representatives of the legal pro-
fession from Virginia and the sur-
rounding states, members of the
University faculty, and many from
the law and undergraduate student
bodies were on hand for the three
lectures. They found in Judge Me-
dina a man of dynamic personality
and forceful voice, and a man of
uncanny ability for gauging his
audience. Like an actor, his deliv-
ery was sometimes slow and well-
spaced, sometimes rapid and emo-
tional. He used gestures sparingly;
his vocal delivery was all he needed
to get the exact mood across to the
audience. And much to the delight
of that audience, the Judge lived
up to the notice that he had given
and ad libbed often and at length.
Indeed, many who heard him con-
sidered him at his best when he di-
gressed from his prepared papers.
At no time, however, did he allow
delivery or digressions to interfere
with what he had to say. And he
had a lot to say.

He told his audience that he
would be “preaching the gospel” as
he addressed himself to his sub-
ject: Ihe Ideal of Justice as a Dy-
namic Force in Society. “I shall try
to demonstrate,” he said, ‘‘the great
importance of the ideal of justice
in our society and its spiritual qual-
ity, and then do the best I can to
explain what we as individuals can
do about it.” With this in mind,
he set forth to criticize present
methods of selecting both judges
and jurors, the business manage-
ment of courts, and the regulation
of judicial procedure.

Noting that the selection of
judges is not based on merit alone,
but is frequently tied up with poli-
tics, the New York jurist declared,
“Iam not attacking judges, but I
do say the existing system of selec-
tion leaves much to be desired...
I am interested in getting the judges
out of partisan politics lock, stock,
and barrel.”

As for jurors, he recalled the trial
of the eleven Communist leaders.
“We had a panel of some three
hundred-odd jurors to pick from. I
was positively ashamed of the num-
ber of excuses offered by those
wishing to be excused. In a de-
mocracy such as ours, we must all
make some sacrifices.”” He also cited
the long list of persons excepted
from jury duty and declared that
these exceptions should be cut
down radically if we are to get the
best possible jurors.

To Judge Medina’s appraising
eye the administration of justice in
the United States is a big business,
but lacking in good business judg-
ment. He maintained that the ideal
way to deal with the situation is
the combination of a single inte-
grated state court supplemented by
an administrative office acting
under the chief justice.

His second and third lectures
were concerned with matters of
procedural reform and individual
contributions to justice. Placing
the responsibility for justice on the
individual rather than on the ma-
chinery of the courts, he advised
law students to participate whole-

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

heartedly in legal aid work. “The
more experience one can get per-
forming services without fee, the
better,” he said.

For lawyers he had this counsel:
“Refuse to participate in law suits
brought by people who know they
have no just claim or who hope to
frighten those they sue into mak-
ing some settlement. ... Nothing is
more precious to a lawyer than a
reputation for integrity and as a
true lover of justice. Once be-
smirched the stain is almost never
quite eradicated.”

And for judges: their part in the
quest for justice can be better ac-
complished if each has constantly
before him the realization that he
is far from being the center of the
universe. “It is when he begins to
throw his weight around that his
judgments are apt to miss the
mark.”

Medina maintained, however,
that the responsibilty of the citizen
is the most important, and offered
stern criticism for those who refuse
to testify in court because of busi-
ness or personal reasons. “One of
the surest ways to sabotage Justice
is to sneak away and leave the field
open to the unscrupulous to fill the
gap.”

He shook a verbal finger, also, at
those persons who hold a personal
grudge against the lawyer who de-
fends someone charged with a se-

 

ScoTt—A_ student discovers life

JUNE 1954

rious crime. “It is all wrong. Every-
one charged with a crime is entitled
to have a lawyer to defend him,
and the more loathsome the crime
the more important it is to use a
free nation to give the defendant
the protection to which he is en-
titled according to law.”

‘The force inherent in Harold R.
Medina’s statements is plain. But
the strongest point he reserved to
the last. ““Has it ever occurred to
you,” he said, “‘that there is a con-
nection between justice and good-
will and freedom? Each of these 1s
essentially a spiritual force and each
reacts on the other. So long as we
cling to the principles of the found-
ers, the Republic 1s safe.”

BOOKS

m PROFESSIONAL BOOK REVIEWERS and
self-styled critics in Virginia have
been working overtime of late com-
menting on two recently-published
novels written by members of the
Washington and Lee community.
Glenn A. Scott, a senior journalism
major from Smithfield, Virginia,
and Charles R. McDowell, a mem-
ber of the law faculty, had novels
published less than a month apart.
The former’s A Sound of Voices
Dying was published in May by
E. P. Dutton. McDowell’s The Iron
Baby Angel was published — by
Henry Holt and Company a month
earlier.

McDowell’s novel is a picture of
life on the public square of Dan-
ville, Kentucky, in 1909. Accord-
ing to Times-Dispatch Reviewer
Frank Adams, “It has been a long
time since a novel so steadily amus-
ing, so amiably satirical, and so un-
pretentiously affirmative has come
down the pike.” |

Spokesman in the McDowell
novel is Harold Hines, Jr., of Chi-
cago, who spends the summer of
1909 at his grandmother’s home in
Danville. Since grandmother §sel-
dom gets out of bed, Harold has
about as much freedom as Huck
Finn. By joining the loafers around
the horse-drinking fountain (orna-
mented with two iron baby angels),

 

McDowrtt—The baby is pure gold

he becomes acquainted with the
town characters and shares in the
town’s events.

Harold meets many delightfully
interesting and entertaining char-
acters in Danville. Author Mc-
Dowell partially describes one of
them, Mr. Baptist, as follows:
“They ask him when to plant stuf
and what the weather is a-goner do.
A heap of folks ask him what to
take for whatever they’ve got, and
when to plant stuff, and all the
likes of that. In watermelon season
Mr. Baptist sells a few watermelons
and cantaloups out of a waggin. Out
of melon season he sells a few eat-
ing apples out of a basket. He don’t
do much good with his apples. Chil-
lun eats too many of them without
paying for ’em. Mr. Baptist gets
along and nobody that amounts to
much ever charges him for nuthin’.
He don’t want much and don’t
need much. Mr. Baptist is just a
sort of community leader.”

Concluded reviewer Adams:.
“The book is nostalgic only indi-
rectly; there is no sentimentality.
It is satirical (of politics, education,
business, reformers, lawyers, ath-
letes) without a trace of bitterness.
It is humorous without resort to
comic effects.

“The Iron Baby Angel isn’t iron
at all; it’s pure gold.”

If McDowell’s novel is bereft of

5

bitterness, however, the same can-

not be said for A Sound of Voices

Dying. ‘The  twenty-one-year-old
Scott’s novel deals with college life,
and although the university has
been given a fictional name, it is
obviously Washington and Lee. His
book, which he describes as “‘being
quietly pessimistic, without being
morbid,” follows a college student
from Rush Week to graduation, a
period during which the student
“grows up,” and in the _ process
finds the meaning of life in his col-
lege career, lives through two di-
ametrically opposite love affairs,
and discovers death for the first
time.

Dr. A. Ross Borden, Jr., pro-
fessor of English, reviewing Voices
in The Ring-tum Phi, called it a
“corking good story,” but criticized
the young author for overwriting
the first few chapters. Scott agrees,
and calls his work “a novel of dis-
covery, in which the protagonist
discovers life and the author dis-
covers writing.”

And having discovered, he con-
tinues to write. The young man,
who studied creative writing at the
University under Dr. George H.
Foster, is already well along on his
second novel. In fact, a rough
draft is now in the hands of the
publisher.

FACULTY

m TWO WASHINGTON AND LEE profes-
sors combined their talents recently
to produce an interesting and eye-
catching article, “Land O’ Goshen,”
which appeared in the April issue
of Ford Times. Dr. Marshall W.
Fishwick, associate professor of
American studies, composed the
word-picture of Virginia’s Goshen
Pass, a spot familiar to all Wash-
ington and Lee men. Several water
color paintings by Dr. Marion M.
Junkin, professor of art, illustrated
the article. Done in semi-abstract
style, they effectively show the na-
tural beauty of the Virginia land-
scape.

This article on Goshen Pass was

a timely one. It so happened that a

few weeks before it appeared, a lum-

6

ber company had contracted to buy
part of the wooded area and was
about to cut all usable timber. Ob-
viously, it would have destroyed
much of the beauty of the scenic
Pass. A number of prominent Vir-
ginia_ residents, including many
from the Lexington area, came to
the fore quickly, and successfully
petitioned the state legislature to
prevent lumbering operations.
“Land O’ Goshen” is now state

property.
SCHOLARSHIPS

m THE UNIVERSITY'S scholarship com-
mittee has awarded more than
twelve thousand dollars in schol-
arship assistance to twenty-nine
men who will enter as freshmen in
September. These grants will be
renewed each year as long as the
recipients maintain high academic
standing. Except for three Union
Carbide Scholarships (covering tui-
tion, fees, books, and supplies, and
valued to the student at approxi-
mately $700 each), all of these
awards are from University endow-
ment, and were made _ possible
through the generosity of many
persons who over the years have
given funds for scholarships.

At first glance it might seem that
Washington and Lee’s undergradu-
ate scholarship endowment (ap-
proximately $700,000) is quite
ample. In reality, however, Univer-
sity officials charged with making
scholarship selections each year are
concerned over its inadequacy, for
the need for these funds is increas-
ing steadily. Among those who have
been granted admission to the
next class, for example, are sixty-
four young men who requested
scholarship aid. The Committee
was able to make only twenty-
nine awards, with the average
grant being considerably less than
the cost of tuition and fees. As a
result, some highly desirable ap-
plicants will be forced to seek
their college education elsewhere.
Moreover, officials are convinced
that many other young men,
equally desirable as members of
the Lexington family, do not apply

for admission as they might other-
wise do, because the number of
scholarships is limited and the sti-
pends attached to them are insuf-
ficient to meet their needs. They
feel that this apples in particular
to prospective students from areas
where the principal alternatives to
enrolling at Washington and Lee
are state institutions, which offer
educational opportunities at a con-
siderably lower cost.

With more than twice as many
applicants as can be given awards,
the selection of scholarship recipi-
ents becomes a matter for consid-
erable thought and study. What are
the policies that govern selection?
Dean of Students Frank J. Gilliam
has indicated that in the individual
consideration of each case, the
Scholarship Committee looks care-
fully for affirmative answers to
three questions: (1) Will the appli-
cant’s family experience undue
hardship if he does not receive
scholarship assistance from the
University? (2) Is the applicant’s
academic record indicative of high
scholastic promise at the Univer-
sity? (3) Has the applicant demon-
strated, by previous positions of
leadership and by interest in a va-
riety of activities, that he has a
strong potential for service on the
Washington and Lee campus and in
after life? .

These are the policies (phrased as
questions) and problems concerned
with the award of scholarships. The
need for additional funds for this
purpose is clearly recognized. The
Scholarship Committee has made
its case before the Steering Commit-
tee for University Development,
which must consider pressing needs
in all areas of University life. Once
this need has been placed in its
proper relation to others, and the
Development Program gains head-

the scholarship picture may become
a more favorable one.

year the University received more
awards than ever before. James C.
Conner of Bethesda, Maryland,
Richard A. Vogler of Los Angeles,
and Henry A. Turner, also of
Bethesda, were honored in this way.
Conner will study history in Bel-
gium at the University of Brussels;

Vogler will'*study German litera-

ture and teach English in Germany;

and Turner will study history at

the University of Munich. Turner
was also the recipient of a Wood-
row Wilson Foundation fellowship
at Princeton, but declined it in
order to accept his Fulbright award.

Another senior, Roy C. Herren-
kohl, Jr., received a_ Fulbright
scholarship but turned it down in

order to accept a Rotary scholar-

ship, and will study philosophy at
the University of Reading in Eng-
land. Another Rotary scholarship
has been awarded to Richard T.
Harbison, who will attend the Uni-
versity of Edinburgh to study phi-
losophy and theology.

Nor is this the end of the list.
Dr. William A. Jenks, associate pro-
fessor of history, has received two
grants for a year’s study in Italy and
Germany. He will study at the Uni-
versity of Florence during the win-
ter under a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and at the University
of Vienna next spring and summer
under a Fulbright award, supple-
mented by a Ford grant. At the
University of Florence Dr. Jenks
will study medieval and Renais-

he will do research in Austrian po-
litical history. Dr. Charles W. ‘Tur-

mately one thousand grants for
graduate study abroad in the aca-
demic year 1954-55 under the
United States Educational  Ex-

In 1949 James H. Lassiter be-
came the University’s first Fulbright
scholar. He studied French at the
University of Grenoble in France.
A year later Luther Wannamaker
went to St. Andrews University,
Scotland, to study philosophy. Guy
Hammond majored in chemistry at
the University of Utrecht on a 1951
grant, and a year later Austin Hunt
went to Stratford-on-Avon, Eng-
land, to study Elizabethan drama.
‘The latter has since had his schol-
arship renewed for an additional
year. And in 1953 three awards were
made to Washington and Lee schol-

down, William M. Hollis, Jr., went
to the University of Brussels to
study English, and John D. Ma-

UNDERGRADUATES

HE ON THE TREE-SHADED CAMPUS in
front of the President’s house, one
hundred eighty seniors received
their bachelors degrees as Washing-
ton and Lee completed its two hun-
dred and fifth year on June 4. As is
traditional, President Gaines deliv-
ered the Commencement address.
He urged the graduates to build
dreams that could surpass expecta-

7

tions of fulfillment. Citing the ex-
amples of the University’s two pa-
tron saints, George Washington and
Robert E. Lee, whose dreams of per-
sonal satisfaction were never quite
realized because of duty to loftier
causes, he pointed out that both
contributed immensely to the world
through their unselfish attitudes
and devotion to service.

Valedictorian Robert O. Paxton,
having undergone an appendec-
tomy a few days before graduation,
was forced to sit on the sidelines
while David E. Drum delivered his
address for him. Because that ad-
dress holds a particular significance
for alumni, it 1s included elsewhere
in this magazine.

‘I'wo honorary doctor of divinity
degrees were awarded at Com-
mencement, also. ‘They went to the
Reverend ‘Thomas V. Barrett of
the Robert E. Lee Memorial Epis-
copal Church of Lexington and to
the Reverend James Nelson Mont-
gomery, a Washington and Lee
alumnus of the Class of 1910, who
for thirty-seven years has been a
missionary to the Chinese people.
Because he is now in Formosa the
degree was presented to Dr. Mont-
gomery’s son.

Earlier in the morning Dr. Gaines
spoke in Lee Chapel where eleven
seniors were awarded commissions
as second lieutenants in the United
States Army Reserve.

B THE 1953-54 SEASON may well
mark the beginning of a new peri-
od in the history of Washington
and Lee’s dramatic group, the
‘Troubadours. Up until this year
(and in lesser degree, last year) the
Troubadours have not been _par-
ticularly successful. Student produc-
tions were not well attended by
Lexington residents and_ student
attendance could be counted on
fingers and toes.

Nor did the Troubadours enjoy
any discernible amount of campus
prestige. As a matter of fact, the
‘Troubadour ‘Theater was consid-
ered somewhat as a “left-wing” ap-
pendage of campus activities. Stu-
dents coined rather unattractive
descriptive terms for others who ex-
pressed an interest in drama. And
although certain names were re-
membered (Austin Hunt, for ex-
ample, who went on to. play
‘Thomas Jefferson in The Common
Glory), student actors received lit-
tle credit and little notice.

In about one year, however, this
picture has changed completely.
‘Today the Troubadour ‘Theater is
well-run financially, and even shows
a profit at the end of the season.
Actors are among the most out-
standing students on the campus,
and plays attract capacity crowds.

Much credit for this turn-about
goes to the ‘Troub’s director, Carl-
son R. Thomas. Previously associ-

 

For the Troubadour’s Mr. Roberts, standing room only

ated with civic drama_ groups,
Thomas came to the University last
year and immediately set about im-
proving the outlook of drama on the
campus. ‘The success of his efforts
reached culmination this season.
Although the opening play, Winter-
set, was only mildly successful, the
next production, Mr. Roberts,
broke all. records. In fact, because
it attracted better than capacity
audiences every night during the
first run, and because many had
been turned away, the students
agreed to present the play for a sec-
ond run. Again the theater was
characterized by standng room
only. The season closed with Ten
Little Indians, which also was well-
attended and well-liked. In_ this
production, however, although the
acting received considerable atten-
tion, the highlight was the excel-
lent lighting and scenery work
turned in by students.

‘Two weeks before final examina-
tions, Thomas decided to hold cast-
ings for the first two productions of
the 1954-55 season: The Male An-
imal and Detective Story. Forty
students, as well as several Lexing-
ton residents interested in appear-
ing in campus plays, attended the
tryouts. Such a turnout was a fitting
tribute to the effectiveness of
‘Thomas’ work as a director and to
the new measure of acceptance
which the Troubadour ‘Theater has.
earned.

m WASHINGTON AND LEE’S forty-man
Glee Club appeared before approx-
imately two thousand people in
three Southern cities during its
Spring tour. Making what was prob-
ably the longest trip ever under-
taken by a campus group, the Club
traveled over two thousand miles to
give five concerts in five days in
Memphis, Shreveport, and Birm-
ingham.

Covering so much ground in so
few days, and doing so by bus, was
no easy matter. Leaving Lexington
early on a Wednesday afternoon in
April, the choral group traveled all
night and arrived in Memphis the
following morning just forty-five

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

minutes before they were scheduled
to appear at Central High School.
Matters were further complicated
when the bus driver discovered that
he had lost the key to the baggage
compartment. By the time another
had been found, the compartment
opened, and tuxedoes donned, only
seconds remained before curtain
call.

‘The Glee Club sang again that
evening before Memphis alumni at
the University Club. A banquet pre-
ceded the concert and a reception
followed.

Bright and early the next morn-
ing the campus representatives were
off for Shreveport. Upon arrival
in mid-afternoon they went directly
to the studios of KSLA-TV to ap-
pear on a fifteen-minute program. A
public concert at Centenary College
was on the agenda for the evening,
followed by a barbecue, sponsored
by local alumni, at the Shreveport
Riding Club.

‘The price of pleasure was a lack
of sleep. With the bus scheduled to
leave for Birmingham at 5:00 a.m.,
the men had to get up before even
the first streaks of dawn appeared
on the eastern horizon. An all-day
ride followed. In Birmingham lo-
cal alumni entertained their travel-
ing guests at a banquet preceding
their public: concert at Birming-
ham Southern College.

A welcome eight hours of sleep
followed, but on Sunday they were
oft again, this time, en route to
Lexington. At two o’clock the fol-
lowing morning the bus pulled up
in front of Doremus Gymnasium
to unload a weary cargo.

It was a long, hard trip, but it
was also a pleasant trip. Glee Club
President David P. Comegys, Jr., of
Shreveport, had many appreciative
words for alumni in each of the
cities visited. In particular he sin-
gled out alumni chapter presidents,
S. L. Kopald, ’43, in Memphis, T.
Haller Jackson, ’48, in Shreveport,
and Clifford Beasley, Jr., ’46, in
Birmingham.

For Duke Ellington’s concert at Finals, no seating problems

accepted, but for several weeks
Washington and Lee students and
Lexington residents thought the
University’s Quiz Bowl team un-
beatable. Harold J. Quinn, Jr., of
Shreveport, Louisiana, Henry A.
‘Turner, Jr., of Bethesda, Maryland,
and Fred G. Lackmann, Jr., and
Robert O. Paxton of Lexington had
chalked up five straight victories
against Smith College, the Univer-
sity of Chicago, Princeton, Barnard,
and Pittsburgh. But it was Syracuse
that proved the truth of the adage
by ending the radio reign from
Lexington. The score: 205 to 130.

Spring vacation followed as a
welcome respite from six hectic
weeks of taxing preparation for
broadcasts. When team members re-
turned, however, it was to more of
the same. ‘This time (for the benefit
of the Student War Memorial
Scholarship Fund) the scholars sat
down to match wits with a different
array of competitors—a high-pow-
ered aggregation of Washington
and Lee faculty members: Dr.
James G. Leyburn, Dr. Marshall
W. Fishwick, Dr. Jack N. Behrman,
and Dr. William A. Jenks. With the
physical education department’s
Norman Lord serving as moderator,
the faculty team, in a spirited fin-
ish, edged their students by a 225-
215 margin.

The Quiz Bowl team’s five radio
victories had earned for the Uni-

versity twenty-five hundred dol-
lars. Members of the team were
given free reign in deciding what
to do with their winnings, and it
was their decision to set up a schol-
arship in memory of the late John
Higgins Williams, popular political
science professor. In announcing
their decision, they stated that
their contribution should be con-
sidered only a start in setting up
an adequate scholarship fund and
expressed the hope that others from
the alumni ranks and _ elsewhere
would supplement their initial con-
tribution.

mH LEWIS CARROLL, in his slightly sa-
tirical Through the Looking Glass,
described a touch-and-go battle be-
tween the symbolic lion on Eng-
land’s crest and the unicorn. The
childish combatants never finished
their contest, since the residents
always drummed them out of town
before the outcome was decisive.
On the Washington and Lee
campus, journalism students vie
with a different lion every year—
the hundreds of high school jour-
nalists who invade the campus for
the annual Southern Interscholastic
Press Association convention. But,
the outcome is usually decisive.
This year, activity around the
journalism department was usually
frenzied. SIPA was celebrating its
25th anniversary, and faculty and

9

 

Alumni and their guests enjoyed “Lunch on the Lawn,’

2

one of the many events planned

for more than five hundred who returned to the campus for Reunion festivities in June,

students alike were determined to
make the 1954 convention the most
outstanding in its history.

For weeks before the convention
(held April 29 through May 1), O.
W. Riegel, director of the Lee Mem-
orial Journalism Foundation, and
student members of Sigma Delta
Chi worried over the many details
that go into making a_ successful
SIPA gathering. A staff of secre-
taries and part-time assistants ad-
dressed and prepared some 2,000
mailing pieces for distribution to
the advisers of high school publica-
tions through the South. Innumer-
able questionnaires were mailed
out; hundreds of letters were an-
swered; an equal number of
weighty problems were handled.
Student workers took care of details
for the registration of delegates,
publication of the special SIPA
issue of The Ring-tum Phi, and the
dance.

Right up until the last minute,
almost everyone connected with the
convention was positive that noth-
ing was ready. But when the first of
the goo delegates (66 attended the
first convention) arrived ‘Thursday
afternoon, the SIPA machine began
moving.

Saturday night after the banquet,
when the convention was ofhcially
closed, the journalism department

1O

breathed a sigh of relief—a satisfied
sigh. ‘Che Silver Anniversary, every-
one agreed, had been one of the
most successful.

Director Riegel had planned a
two-day schedule to keep the young
editors and staff writers busy listen-
ing to prominent professionals in

-the fields of journalism, advertis-

ing, cartooning, and the graphic
arts. Among the leading speakers
on the program were Joseph C.
Harsch, Washington correspondent
for the Christian Science Monitor,
Mort Walker, creator of the syndi-
cated comic strip, “Beetle Bailey,”
and Charles ‘Tudor, art director
for Life magazine. Harsch spoke on
“USA vs. USSR, a Reporter's. Re-
port on the Cold War.” Cartoonist
Walker delivered an_ illustrated
talk, and ‘Tudor lectured on “Page
Design and Illustration.”

High school newspapers, year-
books, and literary magazines were

--eriticized ‘by a” panel of judges,

which included several prominent
Southern reporters, editors, and
publisher’s representatives. At the
awards banquet on the final éve-
ning fourteen advisers of student
publications were honored — by
the newly-established Distinguished
Service Award, and many publica-
tions received awards for outstand-
ing high school journalism.

When the Association had left
the campus, Riegel, his staff, and his
students returned to the normal ac-
tivity of their department. They
had once again fought the SIPA
lion, and won.

BETA GAMMA _ SIGMA, honorary
scholarship fraternity of the School
of Commerce and Administration,
held its annual banquet and initia-
tion ceremony in late April. Dr.
Robert H. Tucker of Richmond,
Professor of ‘Economics, Emeritus
and former Dean of the University,

the church, are divided» among
three denominations, Presbyterian,

sons of businessmen, doctors,
farmers, and government service
employees. Asked if there were
particular reasons for the size of
the group, Dr. Gaines, who taught
several of the men in a Bible
course, was quick to credit “honest
thinking and serious intent” with
leading to the selection.

ATHLETICS

# AT THE ANNUAL senior banquet,
held at Natural Bridge Hotel in
May, The Southern Collegian
presented its Outstanding Athlete
Awards for 1953-54. There was very
little question in anybody’s mind
as to who would receive them.
Senior class members and adminis-
trative officers applauded enthus-
iastically when William D. Mc-
Henry of Swarthmore, Pennsylva-
nia walked to the speakers’ table to
receive his award. McHenry had
been captain and center for the
varsity football team and an out-
standing midfieldman on the la-
crosse squad.

A second round of applause was
for Walter W. Diggs of Cordova,

 

DIGGs

Tennessee, as he stood up to re-
ceive a similar award for his con-
tribution to athletics at Washing-
ton and Lee. Although the Gen-
erals’ track team went through its
six-meet season without a_ win,
Diggs never failed to take pole
vaulting honors. He was ranked as
one of the South’s outstanding
vaulters, and only a few days before
the banquet had broken a Southern
Conference record by vaulting 13
feet one-half inch, the best jump
recorded in Conference competition
since 1928. Needless to say, Diggs’
leap also set a new Washington and
Lee record. ‘The tall, slender senior
made headlines consistently during
the cross-country season, also, as he
set a grueling pace, and rarely was
nosed out for first place honors.

m ON THE BASEBALL diamond, the
Generals got off to a slow start dur-
ing the annual spring trip and never
managed to get out of the doldrums.
The reason for the unsuccessful
season (4 wins, 15 losses): no
batting strength. The team had
some fine infield and outfield tal-
ent, but not one player hit over
.300. Highest batting average was
turned in by outfielder Fred Ben-
ham, a mediocre .280.

Nor is the outlook for next year
very encouraging, for two of the
team’s most enthusiastic competi-
tors, Steve Schlossman and catcher

11

 

Warren Moody, have graduated.
Coach Billy McCann has trained
some up-and-coming freshman play-
ers, however, and if the outlook is
not encouraging, at least it is not
dismally discouraging.

WASHINGTON AND LEE’S_ lacrosse
team may not have had the best
record among spring sports, but it
was the most talked-about and care-
fully watched team on the campus.
Credit for this intense interest in
a minor sport goes to Coach Charlie
Herbert, a former All-American
lacrosseman at Maryland, who came
to the University in February to
coach lacrosse and instruct in phys-
ical education.

Herbert, a 27-year-old native
Baltimorean, worked hard at build-
ing interest in the game. ‘Iwo days
after his arrival on campus, he
made it his business to meet student
editors and sports writers and talk
over his plans with them. He pre-
pared mimeographed sheets ex-
plaining the game’s complicated
rules and procedures. He showed a
film on lacrosse, and “beat the
drum” for several days preceding
the showing to assure a good atten-
dance. In about two weeks’ time he
was calling most of the students by
their first names, and everybody
knew Charlie Herbert. His efforts
paid off. More students turned out
for lacrosse than for any other
sport. |

A rugged coach, Herbert believes
in hard training, and is not averse
to kicking up a little fire and brim-
stone on the practice field. And,
although anxious to build up a
winning team, he scheduled dif-
ficult competition. ‘The opening
game, for example, was with the
perennial championship _ team,
Maryland. An unprecedented num-
ber of partisan spectators turned
out to see the visitors win by a 9-2
count.

A 4-7 record notwithstanding, the
season was successful. ‘Two lacrosse-
men, both seniors, were selected to
play in the North-South game: de-
fenseman ‘Tom Kenny and goalie
Fletcher Lowe. ‘The latter is easily

12

_affectionately known as

one of the top players in the South
with an 18-plus game-save average.

Bw AS FAR AS WINS and losses are con-
cerned, the tennis team made the
best showing of the spring season.
Coach Jim Farrar saw his squad
win seven out of ten contests. Al-
though it had a good chance to win,
the team voted not to participate
in the Southern Conference tour-
ney since to several of the top play-
ers it seemed more important to
conquer scholastic hurdles.

It would appear that losses via
graduation will not injure the ten-
nis team’s chances for another top-
notch season next year. The fresh-
men won all three of their matches
this season, and the top men will
be on hand next year to fill the
gaps in the varsity ranks.

m THE UNIVERSITY’S GOLF team came
up with an enviable 4-2 season’s
record as Coach Cy ‘Twombly
steered his team to third place in
both Southern Conference and All-
State competition. But the real at-
tention-getter on the links was the
freshman team, which came out on

INTRAMURALS

DELTA TAU DELTA won the com-
bined Varsity-Intramural Athletic
‘Trophy for the 1953-54 season with
the grand total of 1848 points. In
acquiring top honors the Delt’s al-
so won the Varsity Cup, scoring
939 points to Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s
684.

By virtue of their first place fin-
ish in intramurals, Delta Upsilon
came within 10 points of the win-
ning total and finished in second
place. Phi Epsilon Pi, though fin-
ishing last, was one of the two
houses with more points in varsity
competition than intramurals.

Norman Lord, director of intra-
murals, expressed satisfaction with
the program this year and added
that the increased emphasis on var-
sity sports by giving an over-all
athletic achievement award, should
help with one of the main purposes
of the intramural program, the de-
velopment of men of varsity calibre.

RETIRES

Cap’n Dick has headed Wash-
ington and Lee’s athletic depart-
ment since 1921, and his jovial per-

sonality is as much a part of Wash-

ington and Lee tradition as the
recumbent statute of Robert E.
Lee in the chapel. For many he is
Washington and Lee’s athletic de-
partment, and his retirement from

the position he has held for so many
years is almost unimaginable. His
attendance at the senior banquet,
as the guest of honor, is only one
of the many tributes paid him
over the past several months by the
University and thousands of far-
scattered alumni as one of the most
beloved members of the college
family.

Over the years, Washington and
Lee’s athletic plant and facilities
have been built almost single-hand-
ed by Cap’n Dick. A survey of his
tangible contribution could cover
practically the entire picture. He
was primarily responsible for the
athletic field, the intramural field,
the baseball diamond, the _ foot-
bridge connecting the main campus
and the athletic field. The bridge—
claimed to be the longest non-sus-
pension footbridge in the world—
was built during the depression for
about $35,000. It would probably
cost five times that figure today.
Many consider the footbridge as
his greatest tangible contribution.

Due to Cap’n Dick’s tireless ef-
forts, Washington and Lee’s base-
ball team now has its own dia-
mond—appropriately named Smith
Field. The field has developed
slowly over the past five years with
Cap'n Dick funneling into the
grading and leveling every avail-
able dollar that could be spared.

Coaching baseball for 30 years
at Washington and Lee, Cap’n
Dick is known as dean of South-
ern Conference baseball coaches.
A plaque presented in 1947 hangs
on the wall of his office in Doremus
Gymnasium which reads:

“In recognition of 25 years of
service; Coach of Baseball, Wash-
ington and Lee University. ‘This
token of esteem is presented to
R. A. Smith by the University of
Virginia, May 19, 1947.”

He continued coaching baseball
until 1952, when Billy McCann
took over.

In connection with his duties as
Athletic Director, Cap’n Dick sup-
ervised the college store and dining
hall, which was operated to provide
employment for athletes. The

honor system was installed in the
first cooperative store. ‘There were
no clerks and payment for articles
purchased was deposited in boxes
in the store. The University re-
ceived considerable favorable pub-
licity from this innovation. Later,
this system was discontinued and
student jobs were created as store
managers. One of these first man-
agers is now a member of the Un1-
versity Board of ‘Trustees, former
Governor of West Virginia, H. A.
(Rocky Holt. ‘The cooperative
store has always been operated for
the benefit of athletes and for a part
of its history was under direct su-
pervision of Cap’n Dick and the
athletic department. It is now un-
der University supervision, but
profits are still turned into the ath-
letic fund. The University dining
hall was also a source of athletic
employment, under Cap’n Dick’s
supervision.

Dick Smith came to Washington
and Lee as a freshman in 1909 from
Fishburn School (now Fishburn
Military Academy), where he was a
top athlete, playing both football
and baseball and suffering shoulder
injuries, which increased to such an
extent that he had to discontinue

participation in all sports except
baseball. He did not return to
Washington and Lee for his senior
year, but accepted a position at
Fishburn, teaching mathematics and
coaching football, baseball and
basketball. He remained at Fish-
burn for nine years, returning to
Washington and Lee in 1921 as
eraduate manager of athletics, a
title later changed to that of ath-
lectic director.

Although Cap’n Dick is retiring
July 1, he is not leaving Washing-
ton and Lee. He will continue to
serve as adviser to the athletic de-
partment, assisting the new direc-
tor with his duties. When he steps
down on July 1, Cy ‘T'wombly, who
also came to Washington and Lee
in 1921, will become acting athletic
director. ‘Twombly has for the
past 33 years served with the physi-
cal education department, is now
at its head, and coach of minor
sports.

Of the many expressions of ap-
preciation of Cap’n Dick’s services
to Washington and Lee, the best
phrased tribute was voiced by Cy
Young at the senior banquet: “Few
men have loved Washington and
Leé ‘as he has.”

 

HE MOST REAL FACT in the lives
Wi nearly 200 members of the
Class of 1954 this morning is the
rapidly nearing time of departure.

Before this fourth day of June is —

over, most of us will have left this
campus. These buildings in their
green valley—and how they startled

us with sudden beauty one moonlit —

night or one rain-fresh April morn-
ing; these faculty members, for the
more fortunate among us, .-warm
personal friends as well as respected
advisors; our classmates, our closest
friends, co-members of the team,
whether it was lacrosse, Sweet Briar
or two o'clock flick: All of this will
live on only in that tantalizing
realm of memory where images fade
the more we try to recreate them.
We will lose much.

Often the emphasis of valedic-
tory addresses is the fond backward
look. One graduate of the Class of
1902 aspiring to be another Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan, looked at it
this way:

“Tf all the sorrow which we feel
at parting could be expressed in
one sad _ sigh, it would sweep
through this building like a western
cyclone and howl its dismal way
around the globe. If all the tears
pent up in these twenty-five hearts
could be turned loose in one flood,

ways to Washington and Lee as
alumni than we were as students.
For good or for ill, the alumni of
an American university have an
immense influence upon the char-
acter of a school. They can either
perpetuate its jovial mediocrity, or
they can break through the restrain-
ing bonds of narrowness and indif-
ference to make it become creative.

It is in part because of previous
alumni that Washington and Lee
is not today a school of jovial medi-
ocrity. As of this ceremony, still
another class can participate di-
rectly in the great growth and vi-
tality which is increasingly appar-
ent on this campus. I would hope
that our alumni, new and old, will
stand up staunchly for Washington
and Lee on four fronts where it
seems to me that this school’s wel-
fare is threatened.

Every independent college today
is threatened on the inflation front.
The increasing costs draining away
the returns on fixed endowment
are an obvious problem which
needs no stress here. It is worth
stating, however, that giving to a
school is contagious; for example,
corporations who are willing to
help private colleges today are far
more impressed by the university
whose own alumni show their grat-

Valedictory, 1954: What will you do about

THREATS ON FOUR FRONTS

Robert O. Paxton

George Washington would stand on
yonder building, knee-deep in
brine.”

Perhaps we need to be reminded
that we are not really leaving
Washington and Lee behind. As
long as we live, the title of B.S. or
B.A. or LL.D., Washington and Lee
University, will stand by our names.
We are, today, merely changing
roles in the Washington and Lee
community—from student body to
alumni body.

In fact, we will be closer in many

14

itude for the past, their pride in
the present, and their hope in the
future.

On the indifference front, Wash-
ington and Lee is threatened with
a long-seige campaign, the sapping
away of our foundations by a cank-
ering lack of interest. It doesn’t
cost a cent to fight on this indif-
ference front. The word of mouth
is more important to Washington
and Lee than dollars. Enthusiasm
and faith in your own school is what
sends the most good men here.

There are some who are not in-
different at all; far from it. They
are eager, but for the wrong things.
On the misguided eagerness front,
Washington and Lee is under con-
tinuous direct attack, often with
rapid-fire artillery, from those who
forget the whole University is here
for the primary purpose of turning
out educated men. All else is instru-
mental; and when these subsidiary
elements of campus life begin to
influence policy of admissions, the
honor system, or scholastic stand-
ings, then the proverbial tail is

wagging the dog.

As if these battlefronts were not
enough, Washington and Lee today
faces a fourth attack. Our fore-

most un-American activity today is

fear of free inquiry. From the stem
of the word, education means that
dangerous and exciting process by
which a man is led out of the prison
of mere inherited notions into the
freedom of rationally chosen beliefs.
This country was created in the
belief that freedom is possible only
where a man knows enough of the
alternative to form his own opin-
ions. ‘The same spirit lives on in
such men as Judge Learned Hand,
who says, “That community is al-
ready in the process of dissolution—
where faith in the eventual su-
premacy of reason has grown so
timid that we dare not enter our
convictions in the open lists, to win
or lose.” ‘Those who fear free in-
quiry would have us_ substitute
training for education at Washing-
ton and Lee—would have us mem-
orize techniques instead of examine
critically ways of thinking. They
fight not on the front, but through
a fifth column—a group which pa-
rades its fear of Jeffersonian prin-
ciples under the bright banners of
patriotism.

I have meant to suggest that
Washington and Lee did not simply
sprout here like a mushroom. The
work of many has made it what it
is. The Class of 1954 looks forward
today to taking its place in the body
of alumni which holds in its hands
the making—or the breaking—of a
great university.

R. JOHN GOODWIN HERNDON, ’11, professor of pub-

Washington, D.C., retired at the end of this academic
year. Professor Herndon, who is an outstanding author-
ity on various phases of taxation, is a graduate of
Washington and Lee University and the University of
Pennsylvania. He went to Haverford in 1928. He has
been associated with the Federal Government in var-
lous capacities. Professor Herndon made the first
modern study of “Public Employment Offices in the
United States”; and the first inventory of Federal real
estate, published as “A Study of Federal Ownership of
Land and Its Relation to State and Local Taxation.”
He also made a study of “Relief from International
Double Income ‘Taxation.’

In addition to his work with taxation problems,
Professor Herndon has been concerned with training
men for entrance into Foreign Service with the State
Department. And, largely as a consequence of his in-
terest and efforts, a study of the collegiate origins of
men in Foreign Service from 1929-49 showed that
Haverford College outdistanced all other colleges and
universities in the country in proportion of graduates
in diplomatic service.

Professor Herndon has written five books on gen-
ealogical investigations, including ‘““The Rev. John
Thomas (circa 16g0-1753),” “The Cunninghams of
Cub Creek (Virginia), “The Herndon Family of Vir-
ginia,” and ‘‘Herndons of the American Revolution.”
He is also co-author of “Fight for Freedom.”

Professor Herndon has served as tax consultant for
the National City Co. and for the Guaranty Trust ‘Co.,
both of New York City, and as editor-in-chief of the

pamphlet which will sell its one-milhonth
copy sometime this summer. Mr. Randolph
has another book or anthology about
Texas which was published June 8. The
new book is called “The Jokes on Texas.”
In a sense it will be a sort of “Texas Brags”
in reverse, a left-handed recapitulation of
the same theme. It is a collection of the
funniest witticisms and the sharpest car-
toons that have been made and drawn at
the expense or the discredit of Texas. Some
are more than unkind and some of them
are almost literally true. Though there
has always been, together with the brag-
ging, a cult among Texans of telling jokes
on themselves, and although this cult was
exemplified as early and by as famous a
man as Big Foot Wallace (a native of
Rockbridge ‘County, Virginia) it remains
to be seen whether or not one million
contemporary Texans are going to buy

ODELL

a Ropnry L. Overy, B.A. ’39, of
The Herald-News, Passaic-Clifton,
New Jersey, was presented with

22

$750 and a bronze medal in New
York City on May 6, sharing sec-
ond honors in the William the
Silent awards for journalism. ‘he
presentation was made by Dr. Leon-
ard G. Korenhorst, speaker of the
Netherlands Parliament, and Albert
Balink, awards chairman.

The award was given for an out-
standing job of reporting and writ-
ing as a mark of appreciation from
the country whose people had been
helped by his efforts, by Herald-
News enterprise and by the warm
generosity of the people of the Pas-
saic area.

The Herald-News telegraph desk
was piled high with the morning’s
accumulation of AP and UP wire
news from the flood-devasted areas
of Holland that February day in
1953 when Rodney Odell looked
up and remarked casually: “I
hoofed it and hitchhiked through

that section of The Netherlands
during the war. Met quite a few
relatives of Passaic people there.
They must be having it pretty hard
now.”

Dikes protecting the Dutch low-
lands were being battered away by
the fury of a North Sea storm and
the highest tides in 500 years. When
The Herald-News made its “Opera-
tion Holland” appeal for the flood
victims, and a generous public re-
sponded with clothing, food and
money, Rodney Odell was flying the
Atlantic with a hastily-packed. over-
night bag, to be at the scene when
the Passaic area’s relief contribu-
tions arrived by ship or plane. Soon
he was cabling home from Holland
the stories of desolation, misery and
courage that he observed in the
bitterly cold, rain-swept country-
side over which he had plodded
eight years before.
