THe Cover: at Parents’ Weekend this fall, these
alumni and their wives were among those present

to visit sons on campus.

 

 

 

Homecoming at Washington and Lee featured the usual imaginative fraternity house
decorations. Delta Tau Delta was a winner with this huge tiger, made of chicken
wire and thousands of paper handkerchiefs sprayed orange and black, with big green

eyes. The Sewanee Tigers managed to nip the Generals on the football field, however.

 

m™ THE UNIVERSITY HAS established

the position of university chaplain,
and the Reverend Milton P. Brown
of Bessemer, Alabama is now serv-
ing in this capacity. He assumed
duties formerly held by the Rev.
Richard L. Gelwick under the title
of director of religious activities.
The Reverend Mr. Gelwick  re-
signed last June to become univer-
sity chaplain at Oberlin College.

92
aa

The Reverend Mr. Brown, a
graduate of Birmingham Southern
College and the Louisville Presby-
terian Seminary, is completing
work on his Ph.D. degree at Duke
University. He will teach one
course each semester in the De-
partment of Religion here, in ad-
dition to his work with student
Christian organizations and chap-
lain duties.

‘Two other new men have been
appointed to the faculty and staff.
They are Dr. John R. Jones, who

is assistant professor of history; and
Christopher McKee, who is cata-
logue librarian.

Jones replaces Dr. Thomas P.
Hughes who has been granted a
one-year leave of absence for re-
search work in Munich, Germany,
under a Fulbright fellowship. A
graduate of Sewanee and the Uni-
versity of North Carolina, Jones
has held teaching positions at both
schools. He is a native of Hunts-
ville, Alabama.

McKee replaced Harold R. Jen-
kins on the McCormick Library
staff. McKee is a graduate of St.
Thomas of Houston and is current-
ly working toward his master’s de-
gree in library science at the Uni-
versity of Michigan.

m TWO PROFEssORS had articles pub-
lished in the October issue of The
Virginia Magazine of History and
Biography. Dr. Charles Turner,
professor of history, wrote on “The
Franklin Society, 1800-1891,” a
political group in Rockbridge
County to which many prominent
men belonged, including Robert
E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Dr.
Fitzgerald Flournoy, professor of
English, was the author of “Hugh
Blair Grigsby, A Virginia Boy Dur-
ing the War of 18192.”

™ TEN YEARS OF TRAVEL and re-
search have culminated for history
professor Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw in
a soon-to-be-published book on the
history of Washington and Lee.
Tentatively titled “General Lee’s
College,” the one-volume book is
to be published by the University
of North Carolina Press.

The book covers the period from
the founding of Liberty Hall Acad-
emy in 1782, to the present. In or-
der to get background material
dealing with student life in the
past, changes in curriculums, cus-
toms, athletics, religious outlooks,
and the like, Dr. Crenshaw has
traveled to Yale, Harvard, and Tu-
lane Universities for research. The

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

volume will be between 500 and
550 pages long.

# ONE OF THE University’s most
popular professors, Dr. Walter A.
Flick, died ‘Thanksgiving day, No-
vember 27, at University of Vir-
ginia hospital in Charlottesville.
Funeral services were held in Fair-
field on November 209.

Dr. Flick had been stricken on
November 15 with an aneurysm of
the aorta to his heart. He and Mrs.
Flick and Treasurer Earl Matting-
ly had attended the Hampden-
Sydney football game that after-
noon here, and after he reached
home, he was seized with the heart
condition. An emergency operation
at Charlottesville followed on No-
vember 16, and the damaged aorta
was replaced with a plastic one. He
made good progress toward re-
covery until the day before Thanks-
giving, when he was stricken again.
Another operation was performed,
but he did not rally.

He had been a member of the
faculty since 1924, and had been
head of the psychology department
since 1936. He was a member of
the National Preparatory School
Committee on Schools and Colleges,
and former chairman of the Com-
mission on Secondary Schools of the
Southern Association of Colleges
and Secondary Schools. He was
widely in demand as a_ public
speaker and had addressed literal-
ly thousands of persons in Virginia
and surrounding states. He traveled
to many alumni meetings through-
out the country, and alumni and
students alike knew him as “Doc
Flick.” He was 63 years old.

= THE UNIVERSITY'S DEPARTMENT of
student health has recommended,
in the annual president’s report on
the university, that steps should be
taken to decrease the number of
automobiles owned and operated
by students here.

In calling for fewer student cars,
Dr. Fred A. Feddeman stated that

FALL 1958

 

“each year sees an increasing num-
ber of automobile accidents, and
this past year was no exception.
Fortunately, none of our students
was critically injured during the
past year; the same cannot be said
for several students from neighbor-
ing women’s colleges who were rid-
ing in cars operated by Washington
and Lee students.”

At nearby University of Virginia,
authorities decided to decrease stu-

dent cars by gradual means, elim-

inating cars one class at the time.
Freshmen this year are forbidden
cars; next year, freshmen and
sophomores will participate in the
ban, and so forth, until by 1961,
only graduate students and seniors
at Virginia will be permitted
automobiles. Needless to say, a
mighty howl arose from the stu-
dents affected, with some _ fresh-
men stating they might have at-
tended another institution had
they known in time of the ban on
automobiles.

 

WASHINGTON AND LEE has received

three gifts totaling nearly $7,000
from two corporation educational
foundations and an alumnus.
Stock valued at $3,786 was
turned over to Washington and Lee
by an alumnus, while cash con-
tributions of $2,000 and $1,000
were received from Burlington In-
dustries Foundation of Greensboro,
North Carolina, and the Lockheed
Leadership Fund of Lockheed Air-
craft Corporation, Burbank, Calif.

Both corporation grants were
renewals of previous gifts made to
Washington and Lee, President
Gaines said. Half of the Burlington
gift must be applied to two upper-
class scholarships, with the remain-
ing $1,000 to be used at the uni-
versity’s discretion. The Lockheed
grant 1s unrestricted, Gaines said.

The Burlington scholarships are
currently held by Robert Conrad
Lemon, Eagle Rock, Virginia,
senior, and <A. Prescott Rowe,
Fredericksburg, Virginia, junior.

B EQUITABLE LIFE ASSURANCE Society
of the United States has made
grants totaling $125,000 to 125 pri-
vately supported liberal arts col-
leges throughout the country.
Washington and Lee_ received
$1,000 of this money, aimed di-
rectly at improving faculty salaries.
Only one other college in Virginia
was selected to receive a grant.

m A SCHOLARSHIP IN JOURNALISM has
been established at Washington
and Lee by the Register Founda-
tion of Sandusky, Ohio, in mem-
ory of the late publisher of the
Sandusky Register. .

‘The award, carrying an annual
stipend of $750, will be known as
the Dudley A. White Memorial
Journalism Scholarship. It will
help cover tuition and other ex-
penses of a qualified journalism
major each year.

‘The scholarship had been award-
ed for 1958-59 to Michael D. Poole
of Vancouver, a sophomore.

Dudley A. White, Jr., is a 1952
journalism graduate of Washing-
ton and Lee.

 

 

Alumni and friends of Washington and Lee may obtain
a picture of the University suitable for framing by sending one
dollar to the Alumni Office, Washington and Lee University, Lex-
ington, Virginia. The photo is printed in full rich color, and
shows the familiar view of the columns. Picture size is 15 by 21
inches. A limited supply of these pictures is available.

 

 

 

 

BH DR. FREDSON BOWERS, English pro-
fessor at the University of Virginia,
was the first of a number of out-
standing speakers at Washington
and Lee during the fall. Dr. Bow-
ers, a noted bibliographer, spoke
on October 3 at the first seminar
in literature. He was followed by
Maurice Coindreau, professor of
French at Princeton University
and a noted translator of American
authors.

Dean Henry L. Kamphoefner of
the School of Design at North
Carolina State College spoke on
‘New Architecture of North Caro-
lina” and showed colored slides,
in a program sponsored by the de-
partment of Fine Arts.

Ross L. Malone, 32, president of
the American Bar Association, was
invited to make the principal ad-
dress here at the annual Omicron
Delta Kappa Tap Day ceremonies.
His visit to the campus was _ his
second in six months, as he was
here last June to receive an honor-
ary degree as Doctor of Laws.

On November 4, the special as-
sistant to the publisher of Time
Magazine, John Scott, spoke on
“Communism and Democracy in
Africa.” He has recently returned
from a world journey as a special
fact-finder for the magazine.

 

# A PORTRAIT OF the late John Hig-
gins Williams, ‘24, was presented
to the University by a group of his
friends on October 29. The cere-
mony took place at the Student
Union building before a large as-
semblage of faculty and friends.
The project was initiated by
Lawton M. Calhoun, ’31, of Savan-
nah, Georgia, and_ thirty-three
alumni contributed to the fund
for the portrait. Assisting the pro-

4

ject in Lexington were Dean Frank
J. Gilliam, 717, and Dr. Ollinger
Crenshaw, ’25. David Silvette of
Richmond, portrait artist, painted
the likeness of Mr. Williams. Mr.
Silvette has also painted a portrait
of President Francis P. Gaines.

Mr. Williams joined the Wash-
ington and Lee faculty in 1928,
after receiving his master’s degree
at the University. At the time of his
death on March 2, 1954, he was
associate professor of Political Sci-
ence.

Miss Mary Barclay, who was for
years with the Alumni Office, un-
veiled the portrait. Speakers includ-
ed Mr. Calhoun and Dr. Gaines.
Among those attending the pre-
sentation were Dr. Keener Frazer,
University of North Carolina, and
Dr. Randolph ‘TT. Shields, Jr., ’32,
of Staunton, Virginia.

R. N. Latture, ’15, head of the
political science department, pre-
sided at the brief ceremonies. He
described Mr. Williams as “the
students’ friend,”’ well-beloved over
the years by a host of students. A

The portrait of the late JouNn Hiccins WILLIAMS, ’24, is admired by principals in the un-

telegram from Senator John Sher-
man Cooper of Kentucky, a close
friend of Mr. Williams, was read
to the group.

H SIX ALUMNI participated in the
North Carolina-Virginia Regional
College English Association meet-
ing at Washington and Lee on Oc-
tober 25. They were William B.
Guthrie, °44, University of Rich-
mond; Edgar F. Stannon, Jr., ’39,
University of Virginia; Archibald
B. Shepperson, 718, University of
Virginia; and George H. Foster,

m= SCHOLARSHIP ASSISTANCE for un-
dergraduates is now at its highest
level in the history of the Univer-
sity.

‘This year, 185 students—repre-
senting nineteen percent of Wash-
ington and Lee’s 959 undergradu-
ates—are receiving $119,280 in
financial assistance, according to
figures announced by the univer-
sity’s Committee on Scholarships.

Of three hundred and thirteen

freshmen entering this fall, fifty-
three are receiving scholarship aid
totaling $34,510.

Most funds are derived from en-
dowed scholarships entirely ad-
ministered and awarded by the uni-
versity. Nineteen scholarships, in-
volving a total yearly stipend of
$14,500, are awarded by outside
sources, including the Union Car-
bide Educational Fund, National
Merit Scholarships, Burlington In-
dustries Foundation, General Mo-
tors Educational Fund, and _ the
Interfraternity Council.

Not included in the $119,280
undergraduate total is $18,000 in
scholarship aid administered from
endowed funds by the School of
Law. ‘Twenty-seven students are
sharing in these grants this year,
says Dean Clayton E. Williams.
The average undergraduate annual
stipend for Washington and Lee

5

 

scholarships is $645. Five years ago
this figure represented the maxi-
mum yearly aid extended by any
Washington and Lee grant. Fresh-
men receive an average annual stip-
end of $651.

Today, Dean of Students Frank
J. Gilliam points out, endowed
scholarships carry annual stipends
ranging up to $1,600 in value. ‘The
most coveted of awards, the Robert
E. Lee Scholarships, range in value
from $1,000 to $1,600, and are ex-
tended to five freshmen on a four-
year basis each year. ‘Iwo Letitia
Pate Evans Scholarships of $1,250
and six of $650 are awarded each
year to freshmen, Although some
awards require special qualifica-
tions as requested by their donors,
virtually all Washington and Lee
four-year scholarships are extended
on the basis of character, academic
record, clear demonstration of fin-
nacial need, and promise of leader-
ship and future usefulness to so-
ciety.

Most upperclass scholarships, en-
dowed and otherwise, are based
upon collegiate academic achieve-
ment and are given generally on an
annual basis. Four-year grants are
renewable each year, depending
upon fulfillment of academic stand-
ards set by the scholarship commit-
tee.

enrollment of 1,000 students par-
ticipated.

This year’s group includes 64
seniors, 61 juniors, g1 sophomores,
and 130 freshmen. Last June, 59
ROTC cadets were given reserve
commissions in the army.

# WASHINGTON AND LEE’S ‘“‘Home
Edition” radio news program be-
gan its tenth year of service to Lex-
ington and Rockbridge county
this year.

Sponsored by the communica-
tions laboratory of the Department
of Journalism and Communica-
tions, the program provides listen-
ers with a complete summary of
world, national, state, and local
developments Monday through Fri-
day each week at 10 p.m.

Programs originate from _ the
campus studios and are aired over
station WREL, NBC outlet in Lex-
ington.

Under faculty supervision of
journalism instructor Rod Gelatt,
all newscasts are edited, written,
and broadcast by students. A stafl
of nineteen, headed by news di-
rector Robert L. Elder, Nashville,
Tennessee junior, is organized into
five production units, one for each
weekday and each under a “senior
editor.”

They use Associated Press wire
copy for state and national news,
but rely on student reporters from
other journalism classes for com-
plete local news coverage.

Since Lexington has no daily
newspaper, “Home Fdition”’ is the
only daily source of local news for
area residents.

show this year.

 

m THE WASHINGTON AND Lee Moot
Court team has earned a berth in
the National Competition to be
held in New York City during De-
cember. ‘he team was runner-up
in the nine-school Region IV elim-
ination held November 8 and g
at the University of North Caro-
lina.

Richard Anderson, Walter Bur-
ton and Charles Swope represented
Washington and Lee in the compe-
tition, with Swope serving as an
alternate. The three, all senior law
students, were selected in a com-
petition held last spring.

‘The Washington and Lee team
was defeated in the regular final
round by the University of Vir-
ginia. Both teams will be eligible
to compete in the Nationals at
New York.

Judging was based on the oral
presentation of the students, their
familiarity with their case, ability
to understand and answer ques-
tions propounded by the court,
their demeanor before the court,
and their written brief submitted to
the court.

The hypothetical case argued is
United States v. Akkro Corp.,
which involves the constitutional-
ity of a federal statute prohibiting
corporations from making any ex-
penditure or contribution in con-
nection with a federal election.

Professor Charles R. McDowell
presided at a _ panel discussion
participated in by recent graduates
of Virginia law schools. The topic
was legal education. Among the
panel members were Robert R.
Huntley, 50, a new member of the
law school faculty, and Lewis R.
Minter, who taught law at Wash-

m FROM THE STANDPOINT of the won-
lost ledger, it was more of the same
in football this year. However, the
record-book—as important a docu-
ment as it is—doesn’t tell the whole
story of Washington and Lee’s 1958
football season.

The Generals won only one
game, lost seven, better than last
years 0-8 mark, but still not a suc-
cessful campaign, by any means.
Coach Lee McLaughlin, who has
suffered about as much hard luck
in two seasons as most coaches do
in a lifetime, looks on his 1958
team as a successful venture in one
respect. He has shown that it is
possible to “recruit’’ talented foot-
ball players, even without the in-
ducement of athletic scholarships.

 

This year’s Washington and Lee
team was a young outfit. Only five
players on a squad of 48 were sen-
lors, only four were juniors. The
rest were sophomores and _ fresh-
men, who made mistakes and
learned many football lessons the
hard way, but according to Mc-
Laughlin, these are the boys who
will bring Washington and Lee’s
football out of the doldrums dur-
ing the next few years.

Immediately following the final
game of the 1957 season, Coach
Mac began a long, difficult search
for football talent. He was looking
for boys with athletic ability whose
parents could afford to send them
to Washington and Lee, and he
was looking for that relatively rare
individual, the talented football
player whose work in the classroom
would qualify him for one of 4o-
some academic scholarships which
Washington and Lee can offer to
freshmen. Among hundreds of con-
tacts he found some of each kind.
Always emphasizing the opportun-
ity at Washington and Lee to get
a superior education while playing
football without the pressures of
subsidization, Coach McLaughlin

Quarterback JACK GRONER lets fly a pass against Hampden-Sydney in the Generals’ 12-6
loss to the Tigers on Wilson Field. The little Metairie, Louisina, junior suffered a back
injury early in the contest, but stayed in the game on offense all the way. He was ruled
oul of the Generals’ season finale against Wittenberg the next week on doctor’s orders.

interested between 40 and 50 quali-
fied young men in coming to Wash-
ington and Lee this year. Of these,
he judged 24 sufficiently well-versed
in football savvy to merit invitation
to early practice. The others went
to make up the freshman team
which played a five-game schedule,
and which will be a valuable “feed-
er’ medium for the varsity in years
to come.

It was an upperclassman, how-
ever, who gave the Generals their
spark in 1958. Passing master Jack
Groner, 165 pound junior quarter-
back, was the offensive key to suc-
cess. In the six games he played,
the Generals were never outclassed,

for his accurate aerials were always
a touchdown threat. Groner com-
pleted 59 of 107 passes for 815
yards, just 38 yards shy of the
eight-game mark of last year. His
favorite target was senior Frank
Hoss.

Game by game, the season went
this way:

WkL 8, Centre 27—first-game
jitters, the usual mistakes by un-
tested freshmen and sophomores,
and the absence of Groner cost
W&L this one. Four pass inter-
ceptions and three lost fumbles
kept the W&L attack stalled, ex-
cept for a 43-yard touchdown pass
from junior quarterback Rich Ab-

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

erson to senior halfback Clark Lea.

W&L 13, Franklin and Marshall
14—This was one the Generals
should have won. Groner’s passing
and stubborn team defensive play
had W&L ahead 13-8 with two
minutes to play. The Generals had
to punt, F&M’s safety man ran it
back 61 yards, and four plays later
the Diplomats scored with 30 sec-
onds remaining.

W&L 13, R&M 12—This was the
sweet one, where the Generals re-
versed the procedure of the previ-
ous week by coming from behind
on their own. Trailing 6-12 in the
final quarter, W&L drove deep into
R-M territory twice on Groner’s
passing, and the second time they
made it all the way on Martin’s
two-yard plunge. Big Bob Harri-
son’s placement was perfect and
the Generals had themselves a vic-
tory over the team that was to
win the state Little Eight Crown
and the Mason-Dixon Conference
championship.

W&L 6, Washington 12— Coach
Carl Snavely’s always tough Bears
found the Generals a different team
from the one they roughed up 47-0
the year before. Groner sparkled
again, engineering a g5-yard touch-
down drive in the final quarter
which forced Washington into a
frantic effort at ball control to
preserve the win.

W&L 7, Southern Hlinois 36—
The Generals led 7-6 with two min-
utes to go in the first half, but then
mistakes began to pile up. An
intercepted pitchout and a fumble
deep in their own territory gave
the Salukis two gift scores, and
the other two were the results of
the Generals’ last quarter gambling
to get back in the game.

W&L o, Sewanee 12—This was
the closest call the unbeaten Tigers,
had, as they rolled up an average
of 36 points a game over eight op-
ponents. A Generals fourth-down
thrust was halted on the Sewanee
one-inch line in the third period,

FALL 1958

and on numerous other occasions
the Tigers were in danger.

W&L 6, Hampden-Sydney 12—
The ‘Tigers broke a 6-6 tie in the
second period with an 85-yard
scoring gallop by Little All-Ameri-
can halfback Bill Benson, then
spent the rest of the afternoon
fighting off repeated W&L scoring
threats. With four minutes to play,
W&L was on the H-S 11, first and
10, but the General receivers just
couldn’t hang on to the ball on
Groner’s end zone passes.

W&kL o, Wittenberg 51—Just
about everything that could go
wrong did go wrong in the first
period against the unbeaten
Ohioans. Without Groner, who was
injured in the Hampden-Sydney
game, the Generals had no offense,
and Wittenberg’s power was too
much.

8 IN THE PRESENCE of one of the
greatest gatherings of former foot-
ball stars ever brought together,
Harry K. Young, ’17, was inducted
into the Football Hall of Fame on
October 28, 1958. Among the spec-
tators were President D. D. Eisen-
hower, General Douglas Mc-
Arthur, and General Qmar Brad-
ley.

This was the latest of many
honors which have come to Cy
Young in the field of sports. He is
generally acknowledged as_ being
the finest athlete ever turned out
by Washington and Lee, and the
only one to captain all four major
sports. ‘The former alumni secre-
tary, Cy is the only man in Ameri-
ca to have been named to both the
Football Hall of Fame and the Bas-
ketball Hall of Fame. His record
for the 100-yard dash at Washing-
ton and Lee still stands, never
equalled by later students.

At the award dinner of the Na-
tional Football Foundation, nearly
2,000 persons watched the induc-
tion of the nine new members this
year. As Cy received his certificate,
a hearty cheer went up from a

corner table occupied by a group
of alumni. A reporter present de-
clared, “Those who know Cy (and
who doesn’t?) and those who grieve
for the Washington and Lee foot-
baal teams of old would have re-
joiced in Cy’s moment. He was
everywhere, shaking a hand _ here,
bending an elbow there. Not even
the President escaped his atten-
tions.”’

The press reported that Cy had
talked energetically to the Presi-
dent, and apparently Ike had en-
joyed it for he laughed and clapped
Cy on the back. What they were
chatting about was the _ baseball
game in the spring of 1915, when
Cy played against General Bradley
at West Point. A fellow named Bob
Neyland was the pitcher and the
catcher was Elmer Oliphant, one
of the all-time gridiron greats of

_ West Point. Cy managed to steal

five bases against this formidable
array of Army talent, a fact that
Omar Bradley couldn’t forget, and
one that the President, also a West
Point cadet at that time, smiled
about.

Among the Washington and Lee
alumni at the Hall of Fame dinner
were: Captain Dick Smith, ’13, who
represented the University; C. W.
Streit, ‘10, Birmingham, Alabama;
W. L. Webster, ’12, Schenectady,
New York; James C. Ambler, ’18,
Montclair, New Jersey; the Rev.
Robert B. Campbell, ’24, Hickory,
North Carolina; John F. Hendon,
‘24, Birmingham, Alabama; Stuard
A. Wurzburger, ’28, Glen Ridge,
New Jersey; R. P. DeVan, jis oa
Charleston, West Virginia; Clark

York; Earl B. Morgan, Jr., 40, New
York City; Robert E. Steele, III,
"41, Rye, New York; and Barton
W. Morris, Jr. “43, Roanoke, Vir-
ginia.

A cocktail party preceding the
stag dinner was given for Cy and
Ruth Young by Pin and Mrs. Web-
ster, and an after-dinner party by
Mr. and Mrs. John F. Hendon.

 

President Francis P. Gaines

R. FRANCIS P. GAINES, Wash-
D ington and Lee’s president for
almost twenty-nine years, will re-
tire from office at the end of the
current school year.

President Gaines, who is sixty-
seven years old, said “‘considera-
tions of general health’ have
prompted his decision to step down
from the job. The University’s
board of trustees, meeting in Lex-
ington in October, granted his re-
quest for retirement with regret.
The trustees also informed Dr.
Gaines of their desire to continue
his relationship with the college
in some other capacity. Details of
this future association have not
yet been disclosed.

Dr. Gaines indicated the effec-
tive date of his retirement would
be September 1, 1959. He and Mrs.
Gaines will continue to live in
Rockbridge county, at their coun-
try home, “Penrobin.”’

‘The president said that the mat-
ter of his retirement had been in
his mind for some time. ‘Since,
however,” he declared, “‘we are en-
tering a financial campaign of ut-
most importance, trying to give
our boys the desperately needed
science facilities, I felt that I owed
the University one more year of
effort.”

Dr. Gaines, with other campus
officials, will participate in a vig-

To Retire Next September

orous program during the winter
and spring to raise two million
dollars for Washington and Lee,
and will address many groups.

James R. Caskie, ’o6, rector of
the University, said, “There is no
adequate way to measure or ex-
press what Dr. Gaines has done
for and what he has meant to
Washington and Lee. Only the
members of the board and a few
of the key men in the faculty and
administration can begin to appre-
clate the magnitude and breadth
of his service. Personally, I am of
the opinion that if the accomplish-
ments could be actually stated, it
would be found that no other man
has done so much for our Univer-
sity as has Dr. Gaines.”’

Dr. Gaines became Washington
and Lee’s head in 1930, when the
University’s total assets amounted
to some $3,290,000. At the close
of the fiscal year on June 30, the
assets this year totaled more than
$16,000,000.

For many years, he has been rec-
ognized as one of America’s leading
educators. Fourteen honorary de-
grees have been conferred upon
him by other colleges and univer-
sities, including Columbia Univer-
sity, Duke University, Baylor, the
University of Chattanooga, Furman
University, the University of North
Carolina, Hampden-Sydney Col-

FALL 1958

lege, Mercer University, the Uni-
versity of Richmond, Wake For-
est College, William Jewell Col-
lege, Waynesboro College, Rollins
College, and the University of the
South (Sewanee).

He has served as president of the
Association of American Colleges,
and the Southern University Con-
ference. He headed the Virginia
Foundation for Independent Col-
leges from its organization in 1953
until 1955, and in 1957, he served
as awards jury chairman of the
Freedoms Foundation of Valley
Forge, Pennsylvania. He was a trus-
tee of the Carnegie Foundation for
International Peace from 1931 to
1951, and for a number of years
he has been chairman of the du-
Pont Radio and Television Awards.
From 1941 to 1951, he served as
chairman of the Virginia State
Committee for War Bonds, and was
decorated by Great Britain with
the King’s Medal for Service in
1946. He is the author of “Lee—
The Final Achievement,” a sum-
mary of General Robert E. Lee’s
final five years of his life, spent as
president of Washington College.

The board of trustees has named
five of its members to a special com-
mittee which will begin the search
for a successor to Dr. Gaines. Chair-
man is Christopher T. Chenery,
0g; and members are Joseph T.

Lykes, ‘og; Dr. Huston St. Clair,
27; Dr. John Newton Thomas, ’24:
and Joseph L. Lanier, ‘247. The
committee at times will include as
associate members one representa-
tive of the alumni, one of the fac-
ulty, and one of other friends of
the University. Mr. Caskie said at
the board meeting on October 10
that “‘we have relatively few names
at the present time” submitted for
consideration as president. He in-
dicated no successor would be
named for a year.

Text of the board of. trustees’
formal acceptance of Dr. Gaines’
request for retirement, and its ap-

Stricter Rules Are Set Up

TRICTER RULES governing student
S and fraternity conduct at
Washington and Lee were put in-
to effect this fall, and the office
of University Proctor was approved
to assist in enforcing the rules.

Last May, the faculty in a special
meeting unanimously reafirmed the
policy regarding student behavior
found in Article Twelve, Section
Four, of the Faculty Rules and
Regulations. The articles forbid in-
toxication, gambling and immo-
rality as “serious offenses against
the welfare, the progress, and the
reputation of the institution.”

In addition, President Gaines ap-
pointed a special committee to
study the problems of student be-
havior and to suggest means where-
by the responsibility of the faculty
in this matter could be implement-
ed.

The committe, composed of Dr.
E. C. Griffith, chairman; and pro-
fessors A. R. Borden, G. Francis
Drake, George H. Foster, ’34; Wil-
liam H. Hinton, ’29; W. A. Jenks,
"39; Frank J. Gilliam, ’17, and
James D. Farrar, ’49, ex-officio,
worked on the new regulations
during the summer months, and the
faculty approved their recommen-
dations. The board of trustees also
officially approved the new job of
proctor for the University.

Text of the committee report is
as follows:

I.

The conduct of a minority of the
students, especially during the 1957-
58 session, has done harm to the
name of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity; it has damaged the reputa-
tion of our student body; and it

FALL 1958

has created grave concern on the
part of the Faculty Administration,
and responsible students.

The faculty, given the responsi-
bility for “control of the habits and
conduct of the students and their
organizations’ (Art. XII, sec. 4) by
the Board of ‘Trustees, desires to
promote the right of student self-
government. But we would empha-
size that no right 1s given without
the acceptance of an accompanying
responsibility. ‘To believe otherwise
is to confuse right with license. Uni-
versities have an obligation to help
students understand their responsi-
bilities. Accordingly, we hold that
students must maintain standards
of acceptable conduct and ungentle-
manly behavior on the part of in-
dividuals or groups will not be tol-
erated by this University.

We believe that recent events
have shown the need to define the
type of behavior that the Faculty
considers to be “offenses against the
welfare, the progress and the repu-
tation of the institution” (Art. XII,
sec. 4). We believe also that the
growth over the last few years, of
conduct that has damaged the good
name of this University indicates
a clear need for more effective
means of developing an atmosphere
in which gentlemanly behavior will
be an accepted mode of life rather
than one that must, unfortunately,
be imposed on those few who have
been guilty of creating this situa-
tion.

II.

In accord with this philosophy
and in recognition of the offenses
that prompted the Faculty to act on
May 19, the Committee offers the

following regulations and proposes
they be incorporated in Article XII,
section 4 of the Faculty Rules and
Regulations. We offer these regula-
tions with no thought of lmiting
reasonable student rights, but as an
effort to develop an attitude that
will permit this University to ful-
fill its responsibilities in the devel-
opment of the minds and spirits of
our students. To this end we in-
vite the cooperation of all con-
cerned in the effective administra-
tion of these regulations.

1. Public Drinking: This has al-
ways been consider a “grave olf-
fense.”” Accordingly, we reafhrm
emphatically the provisions of Ar-
ticle XII, section 4, 2 of the Facul-
ty Rules and Regulations.

Guests in fraternity houses: ‘The
right to entertain guests in frater-
nity houses involves the responsi-
bility to preserve an atmosphere of
propriety in accord with commonly
accepted standards. Accordingly,

a. No women guests are permit-
ted above the first floor of a fra-
ternity house.

b. Women guests are to leave fra-
ternity houses by 2:00 a.m. ex-
cept on weekends of University
Dances when the hour shall be
3:00 a.m.

c. Fraternity members and their
guests must conduct themselves in
such manner as not to disturb the
peace and sensibilities of the com-
munity.

3. Fraternity house parties: We
recognize the existing regulations
of the Interfraternity Council con-
trolling the number and _ schedul-
ing of fraternity house parties. ‘The

Capital Fund Campaign
Gets Under Way

ASHINGTON AND LEE Univer-
W sity’s largest capital fund cam-
paign in its two hundred and
ten year history is now under way.
Long-range goal of the drive 1s
close to seven million dollars, with
alumni, parents, friends of the
University, and corporations being
asked to participate in the two-
phase campaign.

The plans call for a nine-year
drive, with the majority of funds
going toward furnishing modern
instructional and living quarters
for the campus. The first phase, to
provide for immediate needs of
science and journalism at the Un1-
versity, began in November. ‘The
goal is $2,000,000. The second
phase will be undertaken at a later
date, and will seek $4,917,195 to
remodel existing structures, to pro-
vide another dormitory, an auditor-
ium, better athletic facilities, an
amphitheater and arboretum, and
utilities.

In forty-four or more areas all
over the United States, volunteer
committees are working in behalf
of the capital fund campaign. ‘They
are being assisted by delegations
from the University, including
President Francis P. Gaines, Di-
rector of University Relations
James W. Whitehead, and Alumni
Secretary Wilham C. Washburn.

‘There is a maxim: “In an age
of progress, a university that stands
still is falling behind.” Washing-
ton and Lee is not standing still.
‘The past decade has seen forward
strides in notable sectors, such as:

general and educational budget
up 56 per cent; income from en-
dowment funds up 178 per cent;
annual giving by alumni, up 365
per cent. Such figures are the hall-
marks of a forward-moving univer-
sity. In terms of new _ buildings,
however, progress has been less
spectacular. Since the end _ of
World War II, only two academic
structures have been built: a tem-
porary cinder block annex behind
the chemistry building, and Jessie
Ball duPont Hall, for humanities
and fine arts.

Of the basic sciences, only chem-
istry 1s now reasonably well-housed.
Biology, geology, physics, and pre-
engineering are being taught under
conditions that, in this day and
age, can only be called sub-stand-
ard.

The first phase of the campaign
seeks funds to build a new biology
and geology building, at a cost of
$870,000, and a new physics build-
ing for $450,000. Remodeling of
Howe Hall for the chemistry de-
partment would cost another $135,-
ooo. Remodeling Reid Hall, to
house the journalism and _pre-
engineering departments, has been
set at $237,000, and the erection
of a maintenance center would
cost $158,000.

FALL 1958

 

Proposed addition to the academic plant will follow the traditional architecture of the
campus. The top photo shows the architect’s drawing of the new biology and geology
building, new physics building, and the existing chemistry building, which will receive
an extensive remodeling job. The lower photo shows how Reid Hall will look when
remodeled. It will then be used to house the journalism and pre-engineering departments.

Before embarking on this drive
for capital improvements, the Un1-
versity sought to determine what
people thought about it. A profes-
sional opinion survey was conduct-
ed among a representative sampling
of those who would be asked to
participate. The findings were grati-
fying. ‘hey revealed a very high
degree, ninety-three percent, of ap-
proval for undertaking a_ fund-
raising program now, and an above
par (ninety-one percent) willing-

ness to make a subscription. Wash-
ington and Lee’s supporters seem
ready to go to work for their Uni-
versity.

As Dr. Francis P. Gaines says,
‘For its material needs the Uni-
versity depends now, as it has
always depended, upon those who
love it and who believe that the
humble successors of Lee can make
fruitful for time and eternity the
inspiring confidence of Washing-
ton, expressed in the gifts of faith.”

Homecoming:

OME OF WASHINGTON AND LEE’S best-known athletes of
other years were participants in the 1958 Homecom-

ing, held on November 8, in Lexington. H. K. “Cy” Young,
"17, who was recently inducted into football’s National
Hall of Fame, was honored at halftime, and with him,
former teammates on General grid teams, and outstanding
basketball players he coached during the 1933-39 period.

Good times, good fellowship, and long talk sessions
characterized the weekend, as old friends got together
after long absences.

Among those present:

Edward Arthur Donahue, “Jiggs,” was captain and
quarterback of the 1914 team. He lives in Weston, Mas-
sachusetts now.

R. Lee Buehring, “Cannon Ball,” was the powerful
fullback of the unbeaten 1914 eleven. He is an attorney
in Huntington, West Virginia.

Alexander Gallatin Paxton, 717, was fullback. He is
from Greenville, Mississippi, and a retired general.

Lee history, lost only one game in four years, and played
pro ball for Detroit. He lives in Beckley, West Virginia.

L. Battle Bagley, ’16, of Fayetteville, Tennessee, was the

How Will the New Dining

HE HUGE ORANGE Steel skeleton
‘| of Washington and Lee’s new
dining hall is symbolic of both
problems and challenges for a fra-
ternity system here that began in
1855.

‘That is the opinion of university
officials and the majority of the
residents of Washington and Lee’s
seventeen national Greek-letter so-
cieties.

Next September, when the din-
ing hall and several companion
dormitory projects are put into use,
all freshmen will be required to
take meals there. Heretofore, most

freshmen—around 85 percent of a
class which averages slightly over
300—have eaten in fraternity din-
ing rooms, first as pledges during
the initial semester and then as
full-fledged brothers after initia-
tion at the beginning of the second
semester.

‘The transfer of these boarders
to the university dining hall or
“commons” during their freshmen
year 1s expected to have both a
short- and long-range impact on
fraternities.

‘The houses will feel immediate-
ly the loss of revenue from fresh-

men diners. Based on the average
pledge class of fifteen students who
pay an average monthly board bill
of $55, this loss figures to be $825
a month for the typical chapter.
Because of economies realized
through wholesale purchasing, not
all of a fraternity man’s food bill
is expended on food, but is used
to pay other expenses of the chap-
ter house. And because many of
these expenses are fixed—fuel, light,
water, taxes, maintenance—the ab-
sence of freshmen boarders will
place an added financial burden
on upperclass members of the chap-

 

new college dining hall, along with other buildings of the commons group, are shown as steel and concrete work rise in the background.

ter. Some house treasurers estimate
it will run five to ten dollars per
member per month.

Membership varies at Washing-

ton and Lee, ranging from 65 to 70 -

in the larger houses down to
around 20 for the smallest. Houses
with relatively small membership
will feel the pinch more than the
larger chapters.

“I think one or two fraternities
will have to close down in a few
years in light of the coming finan-
cial situation,” says Don Morine,
senior from Cleveland, Ohio, and
president of Sigma Chi.

This opinion is echoed by other
chapter presidents, although none
thinks his house will be one of
those having to pull out.

“I think seventeen houses are
too many for a small school like
Washington and Lee, anyway,” says
Jerry Lindquist, of Memphis, ‘Ten-
nessee, president of Lambda Chi
Alpha.

“We're going to examine our ex-
penses very carefully and attempt
to cut costs,” says Joe Stevens, of
Huntington, West Virginia, head
of Kappa Sigma.

Recognizing the important and
almost integral role the fraternity
system plays in overall university
life, Washington and Lee has
named a special faculty committee
which will offer financial advice to
houses experiencing difficulties.
The university holds mortgages on
all but one fraternity, and readjust-
ments in the amortization process
have been been suggested as a

FALL 1958

means by which Washington and
Lee can assist fraternities seeking
help.

An alumni newsletter of at least
one fraternity regularly accuses
Washington and Lee’s faculty and
administration of trying to remove
the fraternity system entirely. The
newsletter says the new dining hall
will be an effective means toward
this end.

Unanimously, chapter presidents
disagree with this charge. They
recognize the new dining hall as a
crying need at Washington and
Lee, and all agree that, in the long
run, the fraternity system may be
strengthened, not hurt, by the new
facility.

With the dining hall available to
upperclassmen as well as the fresh-
men class, fraternities will have to
show prospective members they
have “something more to offer than
a place to eat,’ one student sum-
med it up.

Fraternity men admit that many
freshmen are eager to pledge a
fraternity largely because it will
assure them of a reasonable place
to eat in pleasant surroundings.
With a year in the university din-
ing hall required, many new stu-
dents will want to take a longer
and more discriminating look at
fraternity life than that afforded
during the hectic five-day “rush”
period.

“In this way” points out Tom
Gowenlock, of Chicago, president
of Delta Tau Delta, ‘‘the commons
will hurt the weak fraternities and

help the really good ones.”

“The break between the good
and not-so-good will become more
apparent,’ adds Dick Gwathmey,
of Baltimore, Beta Theta Pi presi-

. dent.

The Ring-twm Phi plans to make
an extensive study of rushing prac-
tices at other colleges. Editorially,
the newspaper points out that the
university is giving fraternities a
free hand to make their own recom-
mendations for rush week.

If second-semester rushing does
come, the long range effect on fra-
ternities could be significant, many
feel. Students who possibly would
have joined under the current sys-
tem may decide that fraternity af-
filiation is not the necessity of col-
lege life it might seem during their
first week on campus.

“Boys will have a chance to make
a more discriminating choice in
their fraternity,’’ Ray Robrecht, of
Mountain Lakes, New Jersey, presi-
dent of Phi Gamma Delta, says. He
and other fraternity leaders believe
that a stronger Campus Club, or
organization of non-fraternity men,
would be a healthy result of sec-
ond semester rushing.

A. C. Hubbard, of Wilmington,
Delaware, president of Phi Kappa
Psi, foresees a high percentage of
fraternity membership at Washing-
ton and Lee for years to come. But
he agrees that fraternities will have
to be on their toes and have some-
thing more of value to offer the
prospective member than an eat-
ing club.

conduct of house parties must be
in accord with the rules and regu-
lations of the faculty.

4. Lodging Houses: ‘The Univer-
sity is concerned with the con-
duct of students who live in pri-
vately owned facilities. According-
ly, students in such rooms or apart-
ments must conduct themselves in
such manner as not to disturb the
peace and sensibilities of the com-
munity.

5. Paid musical entertainment:

a. The use of paid musical en-
tertainers (such as combos or their
equivalent) in out of fraternity
house on Sundays runs counter to
the rights of those who regard this
as a day of rest, quiet, and wor-
ship. Students have the obligation
to respect these rights. According-
ly, the use of such entertainment
in fraternity house or on fraternity
property is permitted only at the
following times: On Fridays of
formal dance weekends from 5:00
p-m. to 3:00 a.m., and on Satur-
days when permitted from 2 p.m.
until 2:00 a.m.

b. The occasions upon which
musical entertainment is permit-
ted as are follows: (1) the three
officially scheduled fraternity house
parties (2) Fridays and Saturdays
of University Dance weekends; (3)
the Saturday of Homecoming; (4)
the Saturday of at-home football
games.

III.

‘The committee recommends that
the following administrative pro-
cedure for enforcing the regulations
regarding good behavior shall be
established:

1. The office of the Dean of Stu-
dents shall be the central agency.

2. The Dean of Students shall
have authority to enforce the rules
applicable to fraternities. In en-
forcing the rules regarding fra-

20

ternities he shall act with the ad-
vice and consent of the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities. Penal-
ties may include social probation
and recommendation to the faculty
of suspension of charter for a fra-
ternity.

3. Phe Dean of Students shall en-
force rules applicable to individual
students including the conduct of
students in lodging house and shall
act with advice and consent of the
Administrative Committee, which
shall be enlarged by two members
chosen annually by the Faculty.
Penalties may include temporary or
permanent withdrawal from the
University.

4. The Dean of the University
shall report to the Faculty month-
ly any actions taken in regard to

the enforcement of the University
regulations regarding student be-
havior.

5. It is recognized that the of-
fice of the Dean of Students may
consult periodically the records of
the town court of Lexington to the
end that good conduct on the part
of students may be promoted and
the good name of Washington and
Lee protected.

6. There shall be establihed the

sist of one full-time employee
equipped with an automobile and
having appropriate authority to as-

General Lee’s Wartime
Papers Will Be Published
By Ciwil War Commission

UBLICATION OF General Robert

E. Lee’s wartime papers and
letters has been put down by the
Virginia Civil War Commission as
its number one task.

Announcement has been made
that the commission will publish
in 1961, preferably in one volume,
all of Lee’s significant correspon-
dence during the Civil War years.
The book will be copyrighted by
the commission in the name of the
commonwealth of Virginia.

Serving on the executive commit-
tee for the project are state senator
Charles T. Moses; Clifford Dowdey,
Civil War novelist and historian;
Dr. W. G. Bean, head of the his-
tory department at Washington
and Lee; Victor C. Barringer; state
senator Curry Carter; and delegate
Frank Moncure. Mr. Dowdey said
he had investigated the cost of the
project and estimated it upwards
of $30,000, provided it can be done
in one volume.

Lee’s papers have never been as-
sembled and printed in a compre-
hensive publication. Many of his
wartime letters, dispatches, and
orders are contained in the 128-vol-
ume series of “Official Records,”
but they are scattered throughout.

State Archivist William J. Van
Schreeven said, “An edition of
Robert E. Lee’s papers, 1861-1865,
would be valuable to both the re-
searchers and to the general reader.
For the first time, the researcher
would have available to him a com-
pletely edited publication of the
papers of the Southern commander-
in-chief. ‘The general reader could
trace the course of the war as de-
picted by the calm, dispassionate,
and highly literate pen of Robert
Ey dsee.
