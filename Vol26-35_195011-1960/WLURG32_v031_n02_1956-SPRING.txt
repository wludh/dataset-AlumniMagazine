Toynbee To Teach During
Second Semester, 1957-58

DR. ARNOLD J. TOYNBEE, world-
famous British historian, lecturer,
author, and philosopher, will teach
at Washington and Lee as Visiting
Scholar-in-Residence during the
second semester of 1957-58. ‘This
will be Dr. ‘Toynbee’s first pro-
longed stay on an American cam-
pus. Announcement of his coming
was made in February by President
Gaines and Dean Leyburn.

Dr. ‘Toynbee’s visit is in accord
with Washington and Lee’s belief
in personal teaching and with the
University’s desire to bring great
minds, in person as well as in books,

 

to the college community for per-
sonal association with students and
faculty. His weekly lectures and dis-
cussions with selected upperclass-
men will receive primary emphasis
during his stay at Washington and
Lee. In addition, several public
lectures and speaking engagements
at other colleges and universities in
the area are planned.

Although the historian has not
visited Washington and Lee before,
he has collaborated with Dr. Ed-
ward D. Myers, head of the Univer-
sity’s philosophy department, in the
compilation of an atlas and gazet-
teer to supplement his ten-volume
Study of History. This supplemen-
tary material, incorporated in one

(c) Time, Inc.

Dr. Epwarp D. Myers, head of Washington and Lee’s philosophy department, visited with
Dr. and Mrs. ARNOLD J. ‘TOYNBEE at their home in London, England, during preparation
of Volume XI of Toynbee’s “Study of History,” on which the two professors collaborated.

2

book to be published as Volume XI
of the series, includes an historical
atlas never before compiled and
data on many historic places which
are not found in an ordinary atlas.
The volume will be of general im-
portance, therefore, as well as val-
uable to students of the Study of
History.

A graduate of Oxford University,
Dr. ‘Toynbee has been a_ prolific
writer and lecturer, his interests em-
bracing three general areas of schol-
arship: Greek and Roman culture >
and history, the contemporary
world situation, and the inter-rela-
tion of ancient and modern cultures
in his theories on the purpose and
meaning of history. ‘Topics of pub-
lished works range from Japan to
‘Turkey, from Russian tactics to
Christian ethics, and from “Greek
Civilization and Character, the Self-
revelation of Ancient Greek Socie-
ty’ to “An Historian’s View of
American Foreign Policy.”

From 1925 to 1955, Professor
Toynbee was director of Studies at
the Royal Institute of International
Affairs, and Research Professor of
International History at the Univer-
sity of London. He has continued
his writing and lecturing since his
retirement, and during 1956 and
1957 he and Mrs. ‘Toynbee will trav-
el extensively throughout the world.

Faculty

Dr. Sensabaugh Appointed
New Academic Dean

® WHEN THE 1956-57 COLLEGE year
opens, Washington and Lee will
welcome a new academic dean. He
is Dr. Leon F. Sensabaugh of Bir-
mingham, Alabama, professor of
history, chairman of the Division of
Social Sciences, and director of the
Evening School at Birmingham-
Southern College. Dr. Sensabaugh
will succeed Dr. James G. Leyburn,
whose resignation as dean was an-
nounced last October. Under a
special George Washington Profes-
sorship, Dr. Leyburn will continue
his teaching at the University.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

An eminent scholar and teacher,
Dr. Sensabaugh received his under-
graduate education at Vanderbilt
University and his doctorate at
Johns Hopkins, where he _ was
elected to Phi Beta Kappa. After
one year of teaching at Birming-
ham-Southern, he served as head of
the history department at Okla-
homa City University for seven
years, returning to Birmingham-
Southern in 1936. Since 1943 he has
headed the history department
there and in addition has served as
acting dean of the college twice
and as chairman of the Committee
on the Future of the College and
the Faculty Research Committee.

Dr. Sensabaugh’s major academic
interest is in Latin American af-
fairs. He studied in Brazil during
1941-42 on a Rosenwald Scholar-
ship, has served as director of the
summer Latin American Workshop
at the University of Alabama, and
has lectured widely under the Uni-
versity’s auspices on Latin Ameri-
can topics. He is the author of num-
erous articles in historical scholarly
journals and also has been a con-
tributing editor to the Birmingham
News and the former Post-Herald.

The Sensabaughs, who have one
child, a married. daughter, expect
to move to Lexington during the
summer where they will live in the
home now occupied by Dr. Ley-
burn. Mrs. Sensabaugh is dean of
women at Birmingham-Southern.

Dr. Gaines announced Dr. Sen-
sabaugh’s appointment to the fac-
ulty at its April meeting. “The
credentials of Dr. Sensabaugh are
most impressive,’ he commented.
“We feel indeed fortunate in ac-
quiring a Dean whose qualifications
of scholarship and administrative
ability are so happily balanced
and of an eminently high level.”

Dr. Pusey Chosen to
Ball Professorship

@ DR. WILLIAM W. PUSEY, Ul, head
of Washington and Lee’s depart-
ment of German, has been named
Professor on the Thomas Ball Foun-

SPRING 1956

dation. Pusey has been on the Wash-
ington and Lee Faculty since 1939,
except for thirty-nine months dur-
ing World War II when he served
as a lieutenant commander in the
Navy. His election fills the vacancy
created by the retirement of Dr. L.
J. Desha, former head of the chem-
istry department and now profes-
sor of chemistry, emeritus.

The Ball Foundation was estab-
lished in 1946 by Mrs. Jessie Ball
duPont, one of the University’s
greatest benefactors, in memory of
her father. Income from a fund of
approximately $100,000 is distrib-
uted among six Ball professors.
Distinguished scholarship, effective
teaching, and outstanding service to
the University beyond the classroom
are the criteria governing selection.
Other Professors on the Ball Foun-
dation are Doctors Bean, Bradley,
Dickey, Light and Stow.

Glenn Grants for Summer
Study Awarded to 22

@ NO MATTER HOW ADVANCED their
degrees, how extensive their past
study, or how diligent their daily
reading, faculty members from time
to time feel the need of “‘intellec-
tual re-treading.” ‘Twenty-two of
the University’s teachers will have
a special opportunity to satisfy that
need this summer, for they have
been named as recipients of John
M. Glenn Grants-in-aid. ‘These
grants, awarded annually by the
University Board of ‘Trustees, are
designed to help improve _ the
quality of undergraduate instruc-
tion for study, research, and writing
during the summer months.

Four professors in the School of
Commerce, three in the School of
Law, and fifteen in the College of
Arts and Sciences have been named
this year. Seven of them will col-
lect material for courses to be given
in the fall. Eight will write or
prepare books and monographs for
publication. All twenty-two look
forward to an intellectually profit-
able summer. For in past years, the
grants-in-aid have brought appre-

ciable benefits both to partici-
pants and to the University, as
teaching has been stimulated and
scholarly reputations improved.

Proof of the variety, scope, and
potential value of the program is
found in the list of this year’s study
projects: —

Reuben E. Alley, Jr., associate
professor of physics, will attend a
seminary on Christian Foundations
for Teaching, at either Union Theo-
logical Seminary (New York) or
Pennsylvania State College.

Edward C. Atwood, Jr., assistant
professor of economics, will serve in
an advisory capacity at the Bankers
Trust Company in New York City,

professor of Spanish, will go abroad
for study and research in Spain.

W. G. Bean, professor of history,
will supervise the final typing of his

fessor of economics and _ political
science, will work in Washington
to complete, with a co-author, his

m# WASHINGTON AND LEE’S increas-
ingly successful Alumni Fund took
a significant step forward this
spring with the organization of
Regional Agents on a nation-wide
scale, to complement the efforts of
Class Agents in annual campaigns.
Eighty-nine Regional Agents have
been at work since April, from New
York to Los Angeles and from
Chicago to New Orleans.

In launching the campaign, a
two-day conference was held March
23-24 to prepare these alumni so-
licitors for their new assignments.
At the meetings, presided over by
Paul C. Buford, ’13, Chairman of

the Alumni Fund Council, they
heard a report on “Washington and
and Lee Today” by University Pres-
ident Francis P. Gaines and other
administrative officials.

Through the combined efforts of
Class Agents, Regional Agents, and
increased numbers of alumni con-
tributors, the Fund now exceeds by
$25,000.00 last year’s record-setting
total of $62,508.77. Alumni Secre-
tary Cy Young reports that, with
approximately a month left before
the close of the 1956 campaign,
“It looks like we’re going to come
mightly close to our goals of $100,-
oco and 4,000 contributors.”

Davis’ First Two Novels
Bring Honor and Praise

m TO BE CHOSEN A FELLOW for the
annual Bread Loaf Writers’ Confer-
ence is a distinct honor. And Pax-
ton Davis, assistant professor of
journalism at Washington and Lee,
has been selected as one of five
young American writers so honored
this year. For two weeks in August
he will act as a junior staff member
at various seminars conducted by
the conference’s directors in Middle-
bury, Vermont, for more than two
hundred writers.

Usually so honored are young
writers whose first works have just
been published. Davis was recom-
mended for the award by Simon
and Schuster of New York, pub-
lishers of his first two short novels
which appear this month under
the combined title, Two Soldiers.
The first of these novellas is about
an Army deserter, the second about
an Army “medic.” Both have set-

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

tings in the Burma theatre of opera-
tions during the Second World
War, where Davis served as a com-
bat medic.

Two Soldiers has been received
enthusiastically. Said a book review
in the Richmond Times-Dispatch,
“It is incredible that the two novel-
las in this book should be the au-
thor’s first novels; his work has
the skill...and finish of the old
hand....If his next book fulfills
the expectations engendered by
Two Soldiers, Davis can take’ a
place in the upper echelons of
writers of fiction.”

Buildin gs

Dining Hall-Dormitory
To Be Constructed

H IF CURRENT PLANS materialize on
schedule, Washington and Lee will
have a combination upperclass dor-
mitory and University dining hall
ready for use at the beginning of

DAVIS
The skill and finish of an old hand

 

the 1957-58 college year. The Execu-
tive Committee of the Board of
‘Trustees, meeting in early April,
voted to recommend to the full
Board the construction of such a
building. President Gaines has
stated that he is ‘‘confident’’ that
the recommendation will be
adopted when the Board meets
early in June.

Long a need at Washington and
Lee and a top priority item in the
University’s Development Program,
the new building will provide din-
ing facilities for the entire freshman
class and for such other students
as may care to take their meals
there, and dormitory accommoda-
tions for a number of upperclass-
men and law students. The exact
size and location of the building
have yet to be determined.

A small campus dining hall was
operated by the University through
the 1951-52 college year, but was
discontinued because not enough
students took meals there to make
the project economically feasible.
With all freshmen eating in the
new dining hall, sufficient financial
support will be assured. Moreover,
this new facility will complement
the long-standing University policy
under which freshmen live together
in the dormitory.

Because most first-year students
now take their meals at fraternities,
and because a University dining
hall might upset the economic bal-
ance within some of them, the Presi-
dent has appointed a Special Com-
mittee on Fraternity Finance to
work with any fraternity which an-
ticipates possible financial difficul-
ty because of the new commons.

Sentiment for a University dining
hall and upperclass dormitory has
been growing for several years. In
conferences with parents and pros-
pective students, for example, of-
ficials of the Admissions Office have
felt keenly the necessity of such a
building.

Law School Dean Clayton E.
Williams reports that enrollment
in his school certainly has suffered
because the University has had no

5

facilities to offer graduate students
transferring to Washington and Lee
from other schools.

Members of Omicron Delta Kap-
pa, acting as a special committee
during the early stages of Develop-
ment Program planning, strongly
urged construction of a freshman
commons and upperclass dormitory
and stated in its report that no
building could contribute so much
to University improvement as
would a commons and dormitory.

Last December the faculty unan-
imously adopted a resolution re-
questing the Board of ‘Trustees to
proceed as soon as possible toward
the erection of these facilities. In
doing so the members of the group
expressed concern that adequate
dining and living quarters were
not being provided for a substan-
tial segment of the student body.

The student newspaper, The
Ring-tum Phi, has debated the is-
sue for several years. During the first
semester of the current year it pre-
sented the pros and cons of the pro-
posed new building, and editorially
urged the earliest possible action
by the University in providing these
facilities. It emphasized that it was
not ‘“‘anti-fraternity” but “‘pro-
University” in championing “a
recognized need.”

That need is about to be met.

Speakers

Variety Characterizes Topics
of Visiting Lecturers

m IF LEXINGTON BE ISOLATED, as
some maintain it to be, it is a fact
continually belied by the steady
stream of guest speakers to campus
halls. Certainly that has been the
case this spring, as visitors have ad-
dressed students on subjects rang-
from Woodrow Wilson to Hitler,
and from national political thought
to local journalistic procedures.

In keeping with the nationwide
Woodrow Wilson Centennial,
Washington and Lee brought to the
campus for its Phi Beta Kappa lec-

6

ture an eminent Wilson scholar, Dr.
Gordon Alexander Craig, professor
of history at Princeton University.
Dr. Craig spoke on Wilson’s ideal-
ism, widening his topic to include
the pertinent question, “Is idealism
in our foreign policy today a weak-
ness?” After tracing Wilson’s
thought progression in the field
of foreign affairs, Craig acceded
that the president had failed to
achieve his goals for post war peace.
“But,” he continued, “‘to say that he
failed is not to say that he was
wrong. It may be that idealism is
the more real realism.”

Further emphasis on Wilson
came during the second annual In-
ternational Relations Week, when
students studied the effect of Wood-
row Wilson on world international
relations. Dr. Ralph E. Purcell, as-
sociate professor of political science
at Sweet Briar and a former vice-
consul at Bangalore, India, spoke
on “The Wilson ‘Tradition in
Asia,” and Dr. D. F. Fleming, re-
search professor of political science
at Vanderbilt, addressed students
on the subject “Woodrow Wilson
and Collective Security Today.”
‘These speakers also participated in
classroom talks and informal dis-
cussions with students.

issued, Professor, maybe you'll get your

An unusual visitor and speaker
was Count Alexander Stauffen-
berg, one of the famous German
trio of brothers who attempted the
assassination of Adolph Hitler.
Count Stauffenberg, whose brothers
were executed by the Nazis for trea-
son, is dean of the philosophy fac-
ulty and professor of ancient history
at the University of Munich. He
spoke to German and humanities
classes. ‘The Count, a poet as well
as a philosopher and historian, is
touring this country under the aus-
pices of the American government.

Journalism students received
practical “working” advice from
two sources. William A. Lashley,
Washington public relations man-
ager for the Ford Motor Company,
addressed students enrolled in the
course in public relations, and
Louis Spilman, editor and pub-
lisher of the Waynesboro (Virginia)
News-Virginian, spoke to members
of the University’s chapter of Sig-
ma Delta Chi, national professional
journalism fraternity. Spilman is a
former visiting lecturer in the jour-
nalism department, and his son,
Louis, Jr., was a member of the
Class of 1952.

“American Isolationism, Past and
Present,” was the topic for an
April lecture by Dr. Eric F. Gold-
man, of Princeton University, who
spoke under the auspices of Wash-
ington and Lee’s history depart-
ment. Goldman is an authority on
American history since 1898, with
special emphasis on the cultural
aspects of its national life. He cur-
rently is conducting studies in
American isolationism in Washing-
ton, Chicago, and Wisconsin under
a Guggenheim Fellowship.

Speaking before Washington and
Lee students and g8o0 delegates to
the 1956 SIPA convention, NBC
news analyst, Pauline Frederick,
urged young journalists to take as
their motto: ‘Inform and educate.”
The Southern Interscholastic Press
Association convention also brought
to the campus the famous cartoon-
ist, Rube Goldberg, who recently

A Diligent Professor and Good Citizen

Dr. Mottatt

To Retire

GrorGE H. Foster, ’34

FTER SERVING THE University for
A thirty-six years, Dr. James
Strong Moffatt, Jr., is retiring. He
came to Washington and Lee as a
member of the Department of Eng-
lish in 1gg0 and since 1938 has
been chairman of the department.
Dr. Moffatt has taught in a wide
variety of fields: Anglo-Saxon, Ro-
manticism, American Literature,
and twentieth century poetry. He
has served on almost every Univer-
sity committee. For as long as most
Lexingtonians can remember, he
has been a diligent member of the
faculty and a good citizen.

But, as hundreds of Washington
and Lee men will testify, he has
been more than only “diligent” and
better than simply “good.” -His
office has always been open to the
inquiring, the confused, and the
merely friendly passer-by. He has
been sparing of heavy-handed ad-
vice and prodigal of his time. No
student ever left Dr. Moffatt’s of-
fice with the feeling he had been
brushed off or that his problems had
been treated lightly. He has read
more themes and term papers and
examinations than he _ probably
cares to remember; but, with a de-
votion that has always astonished
his colleagues, he has read those
endless papers with care, never
failing to make a comment that

SPRING 1956

gave due credit to the talented and
encouragement to the strugglers.
He has enjoyed teaching and
liked the people he has taught.
When he saw them outside the class-
room, he never failed to convey his
pleasure at seeing them or his con-
viction that whatever they were
doing was perfectly all right with
him. He has always believed in the
ultimate decency of Washington
and Lee students; somehow this
belief has persuaded young men to
behave in a way that would please
Dr. Moffatt. He has seldom missed
a student event and for years has

been our most ardent sports fan,

in the good times and lean ones.

Perhaps his most remarkable
quality has been his tolerance.
‘Though a man of strong convic-
tions, he has tried not to preach to
the young. He knows the frailty of
students but his knowledge has
never led him to denunciations of
the uncertain, the imperfect, and
the gullible. He has never insisted
on his own superiority at the ex-
pense of those who still have much
to learn.

To the unsophisticated in his
classes, he has been gentle and
understanding. ‘To the ultra-sophis-
ticated, a few of whom always
seem to love books and _ loathe
people, he has sometimes been able

 

to impart a sense of measure, never
discouraging the desire to learn, but
conveying always the humane as-

pect of the humanities he has
taught so long and so well. To the
city boys who came to Washington
and Lee he has brought the gen-
erous spirit of that fine kind of
Southerner who loves literature and
dogs and birds and people, though
not necessarily in that order. As
chairman of the Department of
English, he has always been gener-
ous, fair, and humorous. By trust-
ing the men who have served under
him, he has extracted their best.
And no man on the faculty has cor-
responded more faithfully with his
former students. He has kept alive
the loyalty and the love of learning
of many alumni in far places.

The Board of ‘Trustees has named
Dr. Moffatt professor emeritus. His
colleagues plan to honor him at
commencement time.

He is leaving Lexington some-
time early this summer for Mt.
Chicasaw, near Due West, South
Carolina, where he and Mrs. Mof-
fatt will make their home. Older
alumni will be pleased, but prob-
ably not surprised, to learn he is
hale and hearty. His last year here
has been marked by the same self-
less devotion to his task which has
distinguished his entire career.

Activities and Honors

THE ASSORTMENT OF NOTICES and
announcements tacked to ‘Tucker
Hall’s two bulletin boards indi-
cates a busy spring semester for
law students with a variety of legal
activities and honors. Sample
notices include:

The Bar: Eight out of nine candi-
dates for the Virginia Bar passed
the State examination given in De-
cember. This high passing average
among Washington and Lee’s un-

favorably with the state-wide aver-
age of 42 per cent.

Religious Conference: Law  stu-
dents were especially interested in
the lectures and informal classroom
talks of Dr. Samuel E. Stumpf, guest
speaker during the University’s an-
nual Religious Conference in Feb-
ruary. Dr. Stumpf, professor of phil-
osophy at Vanderbilt and a law
graduate, spoke on legal ethics and
the morality of the law.

Lecture Series: Three outstand-
ing lawyers appeared on the Student
Bar Association’s spring lecture
series: William L. Zimmer, of the
Richmond firm of McGuire, Egeles-
ton, Bocock, and Wood, spoke on
the general subject of taxation; Dr.
Charles W. Whitmore of Lynch-
burg, a lawyer-physician, conducted
two lectures on medical jurispru-
dence; and Edmund D. Campbell,
B.A. 718 and LL.B. ‘22, spoke on
law practice in the federal courts.
Campbell, son of the late Dean
Henry D. Campbell of Washington
and Lee, is a member of a law firm
in Washington, D. C.

Professional Fraternities: New
initiates of Washington and Lee’s
two legal fraternities were wel-

comed into the University’s chapters
in March. ‘Ten law students were
initiated into Phi Alpha Delta,
fifteen into Phi Delta Phi. Edward
S. Graves, B.A. ’g30 and M.A. ’31,
a practicing attorney from Lynch-
burg, was named an honorary mem-
ber of Phi Delta Phi.

Mock Convention: Notices of
state delegation meetings, commit-
tee posts, and state assigninents oc-
cupied considerable space on the
bulletin boards during April as
law students assumed many leader-
ship roles in the Mock Convention.
Chairman of the Convention was
Carl D. Swanson, an intermediate
law student from Kansas City, Mis-
souri. Four law students served
on the steering committee, while
eight others were chairmen of var-
ious state delegations.

Order of the Coif: Special honor
was paid to three students when
they were initiated into the Order
of the Coif, for “distinguished
scholarship among seniors in the
School of Law’—Edward E. Ellis,
Fort Knox, Kentucky; Beverly G.
Stephenson, Wakefield, Virginia;
and George S. Wilson, III, Owens-

Board Directs Abolition
of “Hell Week” Excesses

TO THE FACULTY AT Irs April meet-
ing President Gaines read a direc-
tive from the Executive Committee
of the Board of ‘Trustees, having as
its purpose the abolition of all
“Hell Week” excesses among Wash-
ington and Lee’s seventeen Greek
letter fraternities.

’

“The Executive Committee...’
the directive stated, “takes cog-
nizance of the disastrous tragedy
which recently occurred at one of
the eastern educational institutions
of collegiate rank in connection
with fraternity hazing, as widely
reported by the press.

“The Executive Committee d1-
rects the faculty to take promptly
such steps as the faculty deems to
be appropriate to prevent the in-
troduction or carrying on of such
outmoded practices at Washing-
ton and Lee.”

The incident referred to was
the death of a student at the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology
as a result of a fraternity stunt.

‘The Faculty Committee on Fra-
ternities set to work immediately,
and after initial study asked the
student Interfraternity Council to
make known its feelings on the sub-
ject and to present such informa-
tion as it thought pertinent. The
Council requested that four of its
representatives meet with the Fac-
ulty Committee in an effort to work
out a plan for effective action, the
enforcement of which would be
assumed by the  Interfraternity
Council. Out of the meeting of this
joint group came a unanimously
endorsed set of proposals which
subsequently was approved unani-
mously by the full Interfraternity
Council and faculty bodies.

The following proposals, there-
fore, shall govern hazing at Wash-
ington and Lee fraternities.

1. No fraternity shall violate the
basic principles of good taste, and
a fraternity will initiate no activity
which will be detrimental to the
reputation of the Washington and
Lee community.

2. No initiation or pledge train-
ing activity shall constitute any
physical or emotional hazard to the
individual. Such potential hazards
include the “long walk,’’ dangerous
physical exertion or exhaustion.
physical violence, paddling, and
other types of obvious abuse. It is
understood that the fraternities will
exercise no jurisdiction over the
pledges during the following: for

Dr. Morton Retires
After Thirty Years

R. WILLIAM W. MORTON, profes-
D sor of philosophy and religion
at Washington and Lee University
and a member of the faculty since
1925, will retire at the end of the
current school year, President Fran-
cis P. Gaines recently announced.

Dr. Morton, who is 65, came to
Washington and Lee in 1925 as as-
sistant professor of Bible, and in
1928 he was promoted to full pro-
fessor of philosophy and religion.
He now heads the Department of
Religion.

A native of Oxford, North Caro-
lina, he is a graduate of Davidson
College, Union Theological Semi-
nary, Richmond, and attended the
University of Glasgow. He _ holds
A.B., B.D., and D.D. degrees.

During World War I, he saw serv-
ice in France as a chaplain with
the American 81st Division. After
three years in the Army with the
rank of captain, Dr. Morton became
director of religious education at

 

Dr. MORTON

Only the best influence on students

the First Presbyterian Church, Wil-
mington, North Carolina, a post
he held for four years.

In addition to his academic
duties at Washington and Lee, Dr.
Morton has been active throughout
his teaching career as an_ or-
dained minister of the Presbyterian
Church. A member of Lexington
Presbytery, he has frequently served
as supply minister for numerous
churches in the Lexington area.

In announcing Dr. Morton’s re-
tirement, President Gaines said,
“Dr. Morton has rendered distin-
guished service as a teacher and as
faculty chairman of the University
religious program, and he has been
a delightful comrade to his col-
leagues and has exerted only the
best influence on his students.”

Upon completion of his teaching
duties, which include courses in
Old Testament history and litera-
ture, the life of Christ and Christian
ethics, comparative religion, the phi-
losophy of religion, logic, and the
history of philosophy, Dr. Morton
plans to devote his time to writing,
continued study and as much gar-
dening as his health will permit. He
has long been recognized as one of
Lexington’s and Rockbridge Coun-
ty’s most successful “green thumbs.”

He and Mrs. Morton live at 303
South Jefferson Street, in the home
once occupied by Mrs. Morton’s
father, Dr. Granville Campbell,
when he was professor and head of
the political science department at
Washington and Lee. Mrs. Morton
is a direct descendant of a member
of the board of trustees of Liberty
Hall Academy, from which even-
tually evolved Washington and Lee
University.

side of the corporate limits of Lex-
ington with the exception of such
functions as formal initiation ban-
quets or service to the community.

4. In accepting responsibility for
the enforcement of the rules adopt-
ed, the Interfraternity Council pro-
poses that the Council enforce these
rules through such penalties as cur-
tailing of pledging and initiation
privileges, the complete closing of a
house for a reasonable period, fra-
ternity suspension, or penalties ap-
plied to offending individuals.

Student Group Organizes
Campus Guide Service

m# A GROUP OF PUBLIC relations-
minded students at Washington and
Lee have formed an organization to
provide campus guide service for
all visitors desiring more than the
usual tourist’s look at the Colon-

 

nade from the Lee Chapel entrance.
Known as the Student Service So-
ciety, the group is made up of eight-
een seniors, juniors, and _ second-
semester sophomores who voluntecr
their free time for this purpose.

The organization is headed by
Russell B. Myers, a senior com-
merce student from Baltimore, who
with a handful of other students
recognized the need for such a serv-
ice at Washington and Lee. Addi-
tional students were enlisted, and
with approval from the University’s
administration and faculty, the
guide service was begun during the
first semester.

Qualifications for membership in
the Society include sincerity of pur-
pose, willingness to learn about the
University, availability, and scho-
lastic standing. Members must study
material concerning Washington
and Lee’s history and the Univer-
sity’s many traditions. And before
a student is “checked out” for guide
duty he must be able to answer
just about any question a stranger
might put to him about the school.

One of the Society's primary
objectives is to assist the Dean’s
Office in playing host to prospective

Fancy Dress President, HENRY HEYMANN of New Orleans, enrobed as the Wizard of Oz,
and his “Princess,” Miss SHARON COHEN, also from New Orleans, parade before admiring
subjects at the annual Ball, one of the South’s most famous collegiate social events.

students and their families, a serv-
ice which Dean of Students Frank
J. Gilham and Assistant Dean
James D. Farrar have been quick
to welcome.

Couples Cavort in “Oz”
at Fancy Dress Ball

m THE LAND OF OZ, complete with
yellow-brick road, tin figures, and
all the well-known characters of that
land of fantasy, was the setting for
this winter’s collegiate Fancy Dress
Ball. Gaily dressed students and
onlookers crowded into the trans-
formed gymnasium to share the
light-hearted gaiety of make-believe.
Cardboard clouds, birds, and but-
terflies fluttered overhead; and mu-
rals of story-book characters covered
the walls. At one end of the floor
stood a huge open replica of the
children’s classic, ‘““The Wizard of
Oz.” At the other end sparkled the
Emerald ‘Throne. Between them
stretched the yellow-brick road—of
canvas—with its dangers and_ pit-
falls. Along that path Dorothy, the
Scarecrow, the ‘Tin Woodman, the
Cowardly Lion and _ others per-
formed their intricate dance figure
as they managed to evade the
Wicked Witch and arrive at the
haven of the Wizard.

‘The annual Fancy Dress extrava-
ganza is one of the best-known col-
legiate social events of the South.
Except for the costumes, students
plan and do all the work, designing,
building, and painting the decora-
tions, rehearsing the figures, and
organizing the undertaking.

Students Build Second War
Memorial Scholarship

m IN 1947, WHEN VETERANS were en-
rolled at the University in large
numbers, some students were discus-
sing one night their own good for-
tune at being able to return to col-
lege. Their conversation turned to
what they might do as a fitting
memorial to classmates and friends
who had been killed in the War. In

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

The DrEvINE ComeEpy featured this “heavenly” combination of cute co-eds, angel end-men, and uninhibited faculty vocalizers.

search of something even more last-
ing than a building or monument,
they hit upon the idea of a scholar-
ship endowed through their own
collective effort. With the hearty
approval of the student Executive
Committee and the University ad-
ministrative officials, the group set
to work to raise the necessary funds.

Self - perpetuating committees
have captured the enthusiasm of
the original group. By 1954 they
had achieved the first $10,000
goal and had set as their new ob-
jective the endowment of a second
scholarship. Projects have included
the annual interfraternity ‘Corn
Bowl” football game, several con-
certs, and their most recent feature,
a musical comedy written, pro-
duced, directed and acted by the stu-
dents themselves. This year’s show,
entitled “Deevine Comedy,” played
to capacity crowds for four con-
secutive performances on the cam-
pus and a fifth at Hollins College.

Ohio Senior Named ’56

29 hours of “B” work.

Monger is at Washington and
Lee on a scholarship established
by the Union Carbide and Carbon
Corporation to encourage promis-
ing students to enter the fields of
commerce and industry. Recently
elected to Phi Beta Kappa, he has
been president of his fraternity,
Delta Upsilon, and a member of
the ROTC band and Glee Club.

m STUDENTS FROM THIRTEEN states
have been chosen for membership
in Washington and Lee’s chapters
of Beta Gamma Sigma, honor so-

tion in the school is prohibited,
“the obligation to inculcate the
Christian ideal is hereby acknowl-

the University and its Student
Christian Council each year sponsor
a Religious Conference which
brings outstanding Christian lead-
ers to the campus for a three-day
schedule of public lectures, class-
room talks, conferences, and small
discussion groups.

‘Theme for this year’s conference
was “Christian Ethics on the Cam-

ed Dr. Waldo Beach, professor of
Christian Ethics at Duke Univer-
sity, who spoke on “The Danger of
Decency”; Dr. Samuel E. Stumpf,
head of the department of philoso-
phy at Vanderbilt University, who
spoke on “The ‘Tryanny of Free-
dom’; and Colonel Francis Pickens
Miller, a member of the Central
Committee of the World Council of
Churches and former gubernatorial
candidate in Virginia.

Dr. Beach applied the ethics of
Christianity to college life and
theories of education. Dr. Stumpf,
a graduate lawyer and lecturer in
Vanderbilt’s Law School, spoke to
undergraduates and law students
about legal ethics. Colonel Miller
emphasized the inter-relation of
practical politics and religious con-

students to act as they profess, re-
lating religious values to their own
personal lives and problems, on
campus and in the world beyond.

Individual Achievements
Highlight Mediocre Season

m= THE LATE WINTER SPORTS scene was
enlivened by notable individual
achievements and a surprising cli-
max in basketball.

The quintet, with 12 wins and
16 losses, ended the season in a
near blaze of glory, pulling off the
upset of the year in the Southern
Conference by beating top-seeded
George Washington, 63-60, in the
first round of the conference tour-
nament at Richmond March 1.
Sophomore Dom Flora of Jersey
City sparked the Generals with 28
points in the exciting contest, but

Flora nor his mates could keep
pace with Richmond’s accurate
shooting and the game ended with
the disappointing score of 65-56.

‘Team high-scorer was Flora with
607 points this year for a 21.7 aver-
age per game, giving him a 1,160
total for his two-year varsity career,
just 26 shy of an all-time major
college record for a player in his
first two years of school. All-State
Center Lee Marshall from Ashland,
Kentucky, made 346 before a
broken finger took him out of play
for the final seven games.

m THE WRESTLING PICTURE Was spotty
as Coach Dick Miller’s grapplers
ended the season with three vic-
tories, four losses, and one tie, and
took third place in the Southern
Conference tournament, held in
Doremus Gymnasium. However, in
that meet Gibby McSpadden from
Memphis, ‘Tennessee, won his third
consecutive conference champion-
ship, this time in the 177-pound
bracket, and finished his college
wrestling career with an amazing
record of 39 wins and 8 losses.

® ALTHOUGH COACH TWOMBLY’S
young golfers failed to repeat as
Southern Conference champions,
they did post an outstanding record
in dual matches, made a creditable
showing in an intersectional quad-
rangular match, and finished second
in the conference tournament and
third in the Virginia Intercollegiate
playoffs. The team gained victories
over Northern Illinois State, Dart-
mouth, Lynchburg, William and
Mary, Richmond, George Wash-
ington, and West Virginia, while
dropping matches to Virginia Tech
(twice) and Virginia. In the quad-

Springs’ Greenbrier, the Generals
lost to Ohio University, but tied

with losses coming at the hands of
Davidson, The Citadel, William

next year for most of the players
will be returning. Especially cap-
able are two big freshmen, right-

was the shattering of the Washing-

junior Alex Platt of Riverside, Con-
necticut. Platt’s heave of 45 feet
32 inches against Davidson broke
the existing standard of 44 feet 6
inches set by H. C. Owings, Jr., in
1936. Platt now holds both shot
and discus records for the Generals.

From Director Roperrv STEWART...

USIC IS FUN, and good music should be enjoyed

by participants and listeners alike. ‘That's

the feeling of Robert Stewart, assistant professor of

music, who is completing his second year on the

Washington and Lee Campus. And the well-rounded

musical program of the University this year seems

to demonstrate his theory, for performers have been

enthusiastic, new musical groups have been formed,

and appreciative audiences have responded to both
traditional and modern musical expressions.

Like June, music “‘is bustin’ out all over.” As proof,
one has only to run down the list of University-spon-
sored musical activities and opportunities quite apart
from formal course work and the personal enjoy-
ment of records in the Anderson Music Room. ‘These
activities include the Glee Club, the Concert and
Marching Band, the Blue Tops, the Intercollegiate
Chamber Orchestra, the German Band, and the Con-
cert Guild. The high calibre of performance, the vari-
ety and scope of the music performed, and the number
of student initiated and directed productions prove
that the University’s musical activities fit nicely and
with propriety within the program of a well-balanced
liberal arts college.

Student-sponsored musical organizations and activ-
ities include the Sazeracs, the Southern Collegians,

14

Let there the

 

 

 

 

 

 

several “combo” groups, the “Empty Fifths,”’ and the
Interfraternity Song Fest.

Largest of the musical groups, the Glee Club has
had an especially busy year, with nine major per-

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

formances. ‘The 32-voice chorus joined with the Roa-
noke Symphony Orchestra and several other college
glee clubs to present Mozart’s “Requiem,” in both
Roanoke and Lynchburg. Other concerts were divided
between performances at Washington and Lee and
at neighboring colleges.

Glee Club innovations this year have included a
freshman quartet, the Blue Tops, who sing humorous
songs without accompaniment, and a bi-monthly radio
program, “Ihe Washington and Lee Glee Club Pre-
sents.” “he Glee Club’s student secretary, William
T. M. Grigg of Bethesda, Maryland, produced this
half-hour show on the local radio station by carefully
editing tape recordings of the Glee Club and other local
musical performances.

The University Band, in addition to appearing at
athletic contests and at the Mock Convention, has
given several formal concerts. A new feature of this
organization is a five-piece “German band” composed
of a cornet, a trombone, two clarinets, and a tuba.
Student-conducted, this group lends unique flavor
to a program of more traditional band presentations,
with renditions of German waltzes in Old-World style.

For the enjoyment and enrichment of campus and
community, the University’s Concert Guild, a student

organization, sponsors campus concerts with guest
musicians and exceptionally qualified students. Its
five programs this year have included: Menotti’s opera
‘“Amahl and the Night Visitors,’ with students joining
guest artists in singing and in playing in the pit or-
chestra; noted violist; two pianists, one of them Dean
James G. Leyburn; and a folk singer, senior Frank
R. Ahlgren, Jr., of Memphis, ‘Tennessee.

In a lighter vein, the Southern Collegians, a dance
band organized in 1950, and newer “combos” have
played for dances and other University functions.
The Sazeracs, a singing group formed last year, ap-
peared at Parents’ Day and sang for the 25th and 5oth
Alumni Reunions. In its third year, the Interfraternity
Song Fest is gaining in popularity, with musical rep-
resentation from six fraternity groups. Newest of the
student organizations is the “Empty Fifths,” a singing
group from Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.

Not all of these organizations are University-spon-
sored. “But,” said Stewart, “we are happy to see this
enthusiasm for music and gladly encourage such in-
terest, for we are impressed by what Washington and
Lee students can do and are doing musically.” The
depth and diversity of Washington and Lee’s musical
activities underscore his assertion.

encouragement of musical diversity.

A college president points out that in education

All Profit But the Professor

T HAS OFTEN BEEN pointed out
I that American higher education
is a multi-million dollar business.
Yet, a great portion of our popula-
tion has very hazy notions of how it
operates. ‘This fact became pain-
fully clear not long ago when a stu-
dent innocently asked, ‘““Who gets
the profit from this college?”

I gave a short answer to the
question by saying that it was fool-
ish since the college is a nonprofit
organization that never has enough
money and is always within a few
dollars of running a deficit. But
the more I reflected on the question
the less sure I was of the adequacy
of the answer.

Actually, of course, a large num-
ber of people make a profit on the
college. ‘The books we need for in-
struction are printed by commer-
cial companies and sold to us at a
price which includes an adequate
profit for stockholders, an adequate
royalty for authors, and far from
indecent salaries for the book pub-
lishers’ employees. Our laboratories
are stocked with test tubes, meters,
gauges, ovens, burners, refrigerators,
motors, computing machines, and
thousands of other large and small
pieces of equipment which are all
sold to us at a price which includes
considerable profit. ‘The desk used
for study, the light burned at night,
the coal consumed for warmth, the
cement for sidewalks, the bricks, the
paint—practically everything neces-

sary for an educational plant is
bought by the college at prices
which produce profit for stock-
holders and salaries for countless
thousands who never see the stu-
dent or visit the campus.

The student himself receives a
large profit. For the investment of
his time and effort he learns about
the world of the past, the condition
of the present, and the hopes and
fears of the future. If the student
is diligent he will leave college with
an infinitely richer mind and spirit.
All of the profits which go in money
to the suppliers of educational
equipment become insignificant
and trivial besides the profit that
accrues to the student.

It seems that the American edu-
cational structure has provided an
adequate reward for everyone con-
nected with it—except the profes-
sors. And the professors are placed
at the most sensitive points in the
structure. Without them it would
cease to exist; with them it will ex-
ist and be good, bad, excellent,
or indifferent.

Books in a library, test tubes over
a burner, mathematical chalk marks
on a blackboard, stars through a
telescope, maps on a wall, and the
statistics of the Federal Reserve
Bank become meaningful and im-
portant only when a learned pro-
fessor interprets them and works
them into the fabric of knowledge
and life. ‘The professor stands as a
willing guide for the student who
must learn not by indiscriminate
reading or undisciplined laboratory
doodling. ‘hese guides cannot be
replaced by electronic brains, the
printed page, or tape recorders.

They must be human beings who
inspire by example and mutual
trust. The true professor is not an
animated card file; he is rather the
creator of living knowledge from
dead facts, theories, and figures.

Some institutions have been able
to reward professors for their la-
bors only by giving them the chance
to be creative. ‘The economic re-
wards from education have gone to
the contractors, the coal mine
owners, the banks, the book pub-
lishers, the desk makers, and a host
of other people. ‘The professors
who make the whole enterprise pos-
sible have asked for little and the
American public has been willing
to accept their sacrifice with only
a faint nod of appreciation.

The time now has come when
individual colleges must make some
serious decisions. We know that
more people want fine educations
than ever before and we know that
there are not enough excellent pro-
fessors to do the job. We know
that fewer people are going into
teaching because only a few can see
an economic reward sufficient for a
decent family life. And now each
college must decide whether or
not it will raise its fees and its
salaries to a level that will attract
excellent people or whether it will
live with a constantly lowering
educational standard.

And the American people must
decide whether or not they wish to
jeopardize the future economic,
political, intellectual, and moral
strength of this republic by re-
fusing to pay for the proper de-
velopment of our greatest natural
resource—brains.

BORN OF A MOCK

POLITICAL CONVENTION :

Excitement and Tragedy,

Inspiration and Understanding

ASHINGTON AND LEE’S Mock

Democratic Convention al-
ready has attracted world-wide at-
tention; the tragic interruption of
its opening session by Senator Al-
ben Barkley’s sudden death and the
convention’s subsequent postpone-

ment have been reported in full.

But the events leading up to the
keynote address and the resumption
of the convention at Mrs. Barkley’s
urgent request deserve telling, for
to the participants they constitute
a never-to-be-forgotten experience,
to which the impact of a great po-
litical personality brought special
vitality and meaning.

Since early November, Conven-
tion Chairman Carl Swanson, an
intermediate law student from Kan-
sas City, had organized and super-

vised state and territorial delega-
tions, and had worked with the
press and other committees. Every
man in the student body had been
assigned to a_ state delegation.
Throughout the winter and dur-
ing the spring vacation, state chair-
men and delegates had been busy
at home-state political headquar-
ters, searching for material and in-
formation and consulting with par-
ty leaders to determine current po-
litical trends. For upon the accuracy —
and acumen of their investigations
was to rest the authenticity of each
“state's” vote.

As the convention neared, state
offices mushroomed in Lexington;
posters of the candidates in extrava-

gant dimensions were hung in
downtown restaurants and _ store
17

 

Political fever in a holiday atmosphere

windows; excitement and political
interest grew. Notices of meetings
filled the campus paper: “The
North Carolina delegation will
meet at 5:45 Monday in the Student
Union...The New York delega-
tion will meet at 7:30 Friday in
the mezzanine of the Robert E. Lee
Hotel... Members of the Cali-
fornia delegation will meet at their
headquarters opposite Pres Brown's
Sport Shop.” Students studied pa-
pers and editorials with unusual
interest. At fraternity suppers and
drugstore sessions the talk was of
the issues and the nominees.

“States” planned their strategy,
built floats, organized their dele-
gations. After the surprising spring
primaries, self-appointed campaign-
ers from the ranks of New York,
Michigan, ‘Texas, and Miuissouri
carefully planned their tactics and
organized “the boom” for favorite
sons. By the time classes were over
at noon on Monday, April 30, the
whole campus was seething with po-
litical fever, and beneath the holi-
day “school’s atmosphere
churned genuine political enthu-
siasm and new understanding of the
political game.

In the hot, humid afternoon a
colorful, mile-long parade, with
more than ninety marching units,

out”’

 

bands, floats, and drill teams,
wound through the crowded Lex-
ington streets. In the lead car with
University President Gaines sat
Senator Barkley, whose appearance
as convention keynoter gave proof
to the national political prestige
accorded the current mock conven-
tion. Virginia’s Governor Stanley
rode in the second car. Pretty stu-
dents from nearby women’s col-
leges sat precariously atop paper-
tufted floats. An all-girl band
dressed in kilts played shrill Scot-
tish music. New Jersey’s float proud-
ly displayed Miss America, the na-
tional beauty. Little boys and dogs
raced beside the displays as the
parade moved slowly and_ noisily
from the assembly point on the Vir-
ginia Military Institute’s parade
ground, through downtown Lexing-
ton, to the convention hall in the
University’s Doremus Gymnasium.

As delegates and visitors crowded
into the auditorium, hilarious stu-
dents in a mood of compressed ex-
citement waved state placards and
cheered. Student Body President
Ellis Drew of Anderson, South Car-
olina, called the meeting to order.
A temporary roll was _ presented,
committees were appointed, and the
call given for nominations for tem-
porary chairman. A delegate from
the “State of California” (Town-
send Oast, from Portsmouth, Vir-
ginia, and chairman of the 1952
mock convention) rose to nominate
Senator Alben W. Barkley; the
seconding speech came from the
Virginia delegation.

Amid tumultuous applause, the
Senator, having been introduced
officially by Governor Stanley, step-
ped vigorously to the platform,
banged the gavel, and launched into
a good-humored partisan speech,
full of scorn for Republican “‘stag-
nation,” loyal praise for Demo-
cratic “progress’”’—exactly what was
called for to give flavor and authen-
ticity to a mock Democratic con-
vention. With a full-armed gesture
he knocked over a microphone.
“That’s nothing,” he quipped, “to
what will happen to the Repub-
licans in November.”

—

he es

The “old pro” obviously was en-
joying himself in his oft-repeated
role as Democratic keynoter. And
a thousand young men in the audi-
ence, catching the spirit, reacted
to almost every sentence with en-
thusiastic applause.

Barkley recited his long associa-
tion with the Democratic party and
his many terms of service in Wash-
ington, and stated with a smile that
he was once again a junior senator,
taking a back seat. “But,” he said,
clearly and with deep conviction, “‘J
had rather be a servant in the house
of the Lord than sit in the seat
of the mighty.”

‘Then he dropped his head, took
a step backward, and fell to the
floor, dead.

HE AUDIENCE SAT STUNNED and
1 After long minutes the
Senator was taken from the hall and
the assembly dismissed.

In the balcony were several stu-
dents who had been serving as re-
porters, along with professional
representatives of many newspapers
and the wire services. Until the Sen-
ator’s collapse, this student press,
with the rest of the “mock” conven-
tion, had been in a sense “plav-
acting.” But at this instant it stop-
ped being a game and became press
reporting of the first order.

 

 

John K. Jennings, a seror from
Nashville, ‘Tennessee, was tape-
recording the session for “Home
Edition,” the School of Journalism’s
nightly radio program. When Sen-
ator Barkley collapsed, he, like
everyone else, froze for a moment.

Shared enthusiasm .....

Then hastily he picked up his mi-
crophone and, with the sounds of
confusion and grief in the back-
ground, gave a description of the
stunned audience, the scramble to
call a doctor, the removal of cur-
tains around the rostrum to give

Ee. and suspended sessions

the Senator air. Continuing on his
own initiative, he rushed his record-
ing, the only one complete with
commentary of this sort, to Roa-
noke, where the Columbia Broad-
casting System received it eagerly

and used it throughout the evening. »

Other students showed equally
good reportorial poise and _alert-
ness. Philippe C. Labro, a French
exchange student, had stationed
himself in the press gallery to take
notes which he hoped to make into
a story for one of the wire services
not represented in Doremus Gym-
nasium. After the sudden collapse
and pronouncement of death, he
rushed to a telephone and called
that wire service in Richmond. De-
spite a heavy French accent, he was
able to communicate the essential
facts to the reporter at the other
end of the line. His account ap-
peared on the front pages of many
American newspapers the next day.

Lloyd A. Dobyns, Jr., of Newport
News, Virginia, had been assigned
to the convention as assistant to
the Director of Publicity. All eve-
ning and into the night he was
indefatigable as he tracked down
information which reporters from
outside the area would have had
ereat difficulty obtaining. ‘The pro-
fessional reporters had high praise
for him and for the student group
as a whole. As Charles R. McDowell,
Jr.,’48, one of four Washington and
Lee alumni covering the convention
said, “The boys acted more like pro-
fessionals than the professionals.”

HAIRMAN CARL SWANSON and
¢ three other Convention leaders
represented Washington and Lee at
Senator Barkley’s funeral in Wash-
ington. Upon their return they and
University officials weighed care-
fully Mrs. Barkley’s admonition,
“Don’t let the boys stop the wonder-
ful convention. Senator Barkley
wouldn’t have wanted it that way.”
Unanimously they agreed to con-
tinue the meetings.

PRESIDENT GAINES

“Measure up to the obligation upon you”

In reopening the convention, Dr.
Gaines said of the Senator, “He
came to us at great sacrifice. He
had had twenty-five invitations to
speak in Virginia in April, but he
came to Washington and Lee be-
cause of his intense admiration for
the authenticity of the Mock Con-
vention....I know you will meas-
ure up to the obligation upon you,
for the eyes of the nation are fo-
cused on this convention and on
this University community.”

Student delegates met the chal-
lenge. In a swirl of political oratory
they nominated their candidates.
Floor demonstrations which fol-
lowed each speech were loud and

spirited. Balloting began, with the
clerk droning the roll. And interest
mounted as the answering counts
came from each state and votes for
leading nominees accumulated.
Finally, after five presidential and
two vice-presidential ballots, Adlai
Stevenson and ‘Tennessee's Gover-
nor Frank Clement were chosen as
the 1956 Democratic nominees.

ND SO THE CONVENTION was over,
A its final sessions a fitting cli-
max to the fun and frolic and to
the undercurrent of serious purpose,
the evaluation of issues and men,
and the awakening awareness of
procedures necessary to place these
men in nomination. Behind were
the drama and the tragedy and the
period when mature judgment and
exceptional ability were demon-
strated so effectively.

Still vivid was the picture of Sen-
ator Barkley as he stood at the ros-
trum, enjoying the coiled enthu-
siasm of his young audience, as he
admitted to the old enchantment
of politics with a graphic self-char-
acterization, ‘“The old_ firehorse
has heard the bell.”

Planning, execution, enthusiasm,
and drama—all these were essen-
tial elements of the 1956 Mock Po-
litical Convention which became a
unique tribute to the man who had
so aptly described its opening ses-
sion with, “This is really exciting.”
