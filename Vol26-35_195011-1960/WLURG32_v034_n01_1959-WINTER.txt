Come Back for Reunion Time,

GENERAL REUNION Of all classes
A is set for June 11-13 in Lexing-
ton, and a big, broad welcome mat
is out for alumni.

Using the slogan, “Be First in
Line in ’59,” the Reunion will
seek to bring hundreds of gradu-
ates together for three days of re-
newing friendships with each other
and the University.

Originating with the Bicenten-
nial in 1949, Washington and Lee
has adopted the policy of a RE-
UNION OF ALL CLASSES every
fifth year. The last reunion, in
1954, was most successful, and saw
the return of some 650 alumni and
their families to the campus. And
now we look forward to this year!

One interesting innovation is
that the three Anniversary Classes
will merge with the Reunion. It
will be recalled that each year, since
1955, the 25th, goth, and 50th
Anniversary Class Reunions have
been held in May. Alumni of these
classes and their wives have re-
turned to the campus as guests of
the University. This year, after
thorough study and a survey made
among the anniversary classes, it
was decided to consolidate the two
events for one large celebration in
June. As in 1954, the Reunion has
been scheduled for the week fol-
lowing graduation ceremonies at
Washington and Lee and V.M.LI.,
because of the limited lodging fa-
cilities in town.

2

 

june 11-12

Lexington will be yours! You and
your families will be housed, by
classes as far as possible, in motels,
hotels, and dormitories close to the
college, and near the familiar scenes
of the campus. Relax! Live again
the days of your youth. Visit with
classmates and friends, compare
notes, and talk over ‘“‘the good ole
days.”

There will be a full program, but
ample time for leisure. Included
are special features and events for
the three Anniversary Classes.
There will be golf, tennis, dancing,
and gaiety for those who wish it,
and there will be serious discussions
of the problems and future of your
alma mater. The ladies will enjoy
a fashion show and the ‘teen-agers
trips to Natural Bridge or Goshen
Pass and other attractions.

 

In view of Dr. Gaines’ approach-
ing retirement, the Reunion this
year becomes even more significant
to many who have had the privilege
of his association. To see a large
circle of the Washington and Lee
family back on campus is perhaps
his fondest hope. Probably no other
man can envision the future of
Washington and Lee as vividly as
can Dr. Gaines, nor so articulately
define its orbit, and he will be one
of the main speakers at the big
event.

The Reunion will also mark the
end of the initial phase of the capi-
tal fund campaign for University
development. Returning alumni
will benefit in explanations of
progress reports and first-hand ob-
servation of its aims and final goals.
Detailed study of the building
plans and the functional opera-
tions of the new developments will
be of great interest to all. Share
with your classmates the opportu-
nity of shaping the important ad-
vancements of Washington and
Lee.

Literature in more detail on the
Reunion is being mailed to each
alumnus. Begin now with YOUR
plans to attend. Coordinate
through the alumni office or your
class agent the friends from your
class or your area who will attend.
BE FIRST IN LINE IN ’59! Make
this Reunion of All Classes the
biggest ever.

APPLICATIONS FOR ADMISSION tO
Washington and Lee in September
are running slightly ahead of the
rate at this time last year, accord-
ing to Frank J. Gillham, Dean of
Students.

Last year, a record total of 1,116
applications was received, from
which the University selected a
class of 312 freshmen.

 

mw THIRTEEN PROFESSORS have been

awarded grants totaling $5,241.40
for study and research this sum-
mer, through the John M. Glenn
grants-in-aid program. Subject mat-
ter to be covered ranges from rock-

WINTER 1959

etry to Scottish migrations and busi-
ness statistics to Civil War history.

Recipients include: Dr. William
G. Bean, Dr. A. Ross Borden, Jr.,
Dr. S. M. B. Coulling, Thomas E.
Ennis, Dr. E. B. Hamer, Dr. Wil-
liam A. Jenks, Dr. Lewis K. John-
son, Dr. James G. Leyburn, Dr. L.
W. McCloud, Dr. Allen W. Moger,
Wilfred J. Ritz, Dr. Edgar W.
Spencer, and Dr. C. W. Williams.

B A FORD FOUNDATION fellowship for
economic research this summer has
been awarded to Professor E. C. At-
wood. He and nine other college
professors will attend an eight-week
regional research seminar in eco-
nomics at the University of North
Carolina. Purpose of the seminars 1s
to enhance effectiveness in teaching,
and to encourage preparation of
significant research studies.

 

m “VIRGINIA,” the first volume in
“The Regions of America’ series
to be published by Harper and
Brothers this spring is the latest
work from the prolific pen of Dr.
Marshall Fishwick, professor of
American Studies. Dr. Fishwick, a
member of the faculty for ten
years, 1s on leave from Washington
and Lee this semester to teach and
study in Denmark on a Fulbright
Scholarship.

In his prologue, Dr. Fishwick
writes, “I am fond of Virginia. My
state is ‘her,’ not ‘it,’ to me. One
of my goals is to cover so far as
space allows, as much of Virginia
history, in space and time, as is pos-
sible. Of course three and a_ half
centuries cannot be packaged, like
frozen vegetables, and put into
neatly labeled cartons. ‘The real
art of the historian is selectivity.”

WE GOOFED

In the last issue of the maga-
zine, when we were announcing
the new book written by Dr. OI-
linger Crenshaw, ’25, tentatively
titled, “General Lee’s College,”
we stated: “The book covers the
period from the founding of
Liberty Hall Academy in 1782, to

 

Dr. E. W. SPENCER, ’53

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

the present.” What we meant to
say was “the chartering of Liber-
ty Hall Academy in 1782.” The
forthcoming history will contain
an account of the period, 1740-
1782 (and beyond) in chapters
one and two.

 

= A BRIGHT-EYED AUTHOR Of sixty-
five has become Washington and
Lee’s first woman professor, and the
first person to hold a special pro-
fessorship established by the late
Arthur C. Glasgow. She is Kath-
erine Anne Porter, who calls her-
self a “full working artist.”

She arrived at the beginning of
the second semester, after serving
as writer-in-residence at the Univer-
sity of Virginia during the winter
months. Miss Porter will hold six-
teen seminars while on campus,
plus four public readings. She will
also meet at least once with each
of the English classes.

Besides her work at Washington
and Lee the Glasgow professor has
scheduled appearances at other
nearby colleges. She also appeared
on the “Camera Three” program
over NBC-TV, discussing — her
forthcoming book, “Ship of Fools,”
to be published in the fall.

Shortly after her arrival here in
February, announcement was made
that she was one of eleven Amert-
can creative artists to receive Ford
Foundation grants this year. A sum
of $150,000 was divided among
the group, to enable them to con-
centrate on creative productivity
for the next few years.

Miss Porter sees her work here
as “sort of a supplement to the
regular curriculum.” She has been
writer-in-residence or lecturer at
many American colleges, including
Stanford University and the Uni-
versity of Chicago.

Last year, the visiting professor
at Washington and Lee was Dr.
Arnold J. Toynbee, Bristish histor-
ian.

m™ YEAR-END GIFTS to Washington
and Lee totaled $283,560, accord-
ing to President Francis P. Gaines.
‘The largest single gift was $111,000
from Mrs. Alfred I. duPont, one
of the University’s greatest bene-
factors. Other gifts included $50,000
from the Baker Foundation; $930,-
ooo from an alumnus of 1950;
$25,000 from a member of the
board of trustees who has given
half a million dollars to the Unt-
versity over a twenty-year period;
$15,000 from another trustee, and
a number of alumni gifts ranging
from $5,000 to $10,000.

m THE UNIVERSITY has been named
to a select group of fifteen liberal
arts colleges in the nation to share
in the scholarship program of
George F. Baker ‘Trust of New
York. An initial grant of $50,000
from the trust will establish scholar-
ships for freshmen entering Wash-
ington and Lee in 1960, 1961, and
1962.

The Baker scholarships will be
held by recipients for four years,
and individual stipends may run
as high as $2,000 per year. ‘They
will be gauged to cover all college
expenses that le beyond a candi-
date’s own financial resources. Re-

We still have some copies of the
15 by 21-inch photograph of the
Washington and Lee campus. ‘The
picture is in color, suitable for
framing, and may be obtained by
sending one dollar to the Wash-
ington and Lee Alumni Office.

sponsibility for selection of recipi-
ents will be placed with Washing-
ton and Lee.

No geographic restrictions are
imposed, although applicants from
the South and border states will
be favored. The trust requested
that the college’s board of trus-
tees play an active role by serving
as members of the selection com-
mittee. President Gaines said that
three trustees will serve in this
capacity: Dr. Huston St. Clair, ’22;
Joseph L. Lanier, °27; and Dr. J.
N. Thomas, ’24.

& THE FSSO EDUCATION Foundation
has given Washington and Lee a
grant of $3,500 in unrestricted
funds to meet expenses directly
associated with undergraduate edu-
cation. The Foundation was estab-
lished in 1955 to provide aid to
privately-supported colleges and
universities. Washington and Lee
has received gifts from the Founda-
tion each year since its founding.

 

ates in Payne Hall. She is holding sixteen seminars and four readings during her stay here.

= THE WASHINGTON and Lee Glee
Club has scheduled a number of
concerts this spring, some of which
have been arranged for by alumni.

On March 11, the club provided
entertainment for the National
Convention of Doctors of Eye, Ear,
Nose and Throat Specialists at the
Homestead, Hot Springs, Virginia.
The club will again appear at the
Homestead on April 7 to sing for
the American Radium _— Society
meeting. On April 14, a joint pro-
gram with the Longwood College
choir has been set for Farmville.
The Brahms Liebeslieder Waltzes,
opus 52, will be sung.

The Glee Club’s spring tour will
be launched on April 23, with visits
to Huntington and Charleston,
West Virginia. Alumni T. J. Mayo,
31, president of Tri-State alumni
chapter, and R. P. DeVan, Jr., °34,
president of the Charleston chap-
ter, assisted with arrangements,
which include appearances at
Marshall College in Huntington,
and the Rotary Club and Charles-
ton Country Club in Charleston.
From West Virginia, the club will
travel to Pittsburgh for a program
with the Women’s Choral of the
University of Pittsburgh. The spe-
cial feature of this program will
be the singing of Randall ‘Thomp-
son’s “Americana.” The tour will
close with an appearance at ‘Trinity
Episcopal Church in ‘Towson,
Maryland, on April 26. John D.
Mayhew, 26, made initial arrange-
ments ‘for this concert.

The “annual spring concert on
the campus will be presented on
April 30, when the club is joined
by the Women’s Choral of the Unt-
versity of Pittsburgh in joint num-
bers.

a THE FIFTH ANNUAL International
Relations Week was held very suc-
cessfully on February 10, 11, and 12,
with three experts in world mili-

6

 

tary, political and economic affairs
as the chief speakers.

Topics included, “Current Prob-
lems in American Foreign Policy,”
“The Irrationality of War,’ and
“The European Common Market
and American Foreign Trade,” as
well as seminars in diplomatic his-
tory, and recent developments in
the convertibility of European cur-
rencies.

Speakers were Dr. Philip C. Jes-
sup, formerly United States am-
bassador-at-large, and now _ profes-
sor of international law and diplo-
macy at Columbia University;
Michael M. Mora, general manager
of the Norfolk Port Authority; and
Walter Millis, consultant to the
Fund for the Republic and former
military affairs columnist for the
New York Herald Tribune.

m= FIFTEEN OF SEVENTEEN fraternities
initiated pledges on the weekend
of February 7. The days before,
known informally as Hell Week or
Help Week, were devoted to antics
by the pledges. These ranged all
the way from wearing lampshade
hats all week, to being sent out on

ae

Kappa Alpha pledges carried this log around

scavenger hunts to locate such items
as 1924 Saturday Evening Posts.
Early comers to the campus one
morning were treated to the sight
of a pledge seated atop the should-
ers of the Cyrus McCormick statue,
caroling gay tunes on orders. KA
pledges toted a log for several days.
Other pledges experienced the
pleasure of smoking cigars in a
closed closet one night. It was all
in fun—but pledges also performed
a civic service. They canvassed for
the March of Dimes too, and col-
lected several hundreds of dollars
for the drive.

& FEWER STUDENTS WERE dropped
because of academic failures at mid-
year than at any time in the past
five years, Dean of Students Frank
J. Gilliam said. He reported that go
were affected by the automatic rule,
and five of these were reinstated
conditionally. In the past five years,
from 45 to 52 students had been af-
fected by the rule. Dean Gilliam
said the greatest improvement was
noted in freshman work, where
only 13 men failed, as compared to
31 a year ago.

     

campus for several days, with a minimum

of puffing and a modicum of grinning. It was all part of the Hell Week activities.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

m IT WASN’T EVEN SPRING, but un-
dergraduates were beginning to be-
have like that season was almost
upon us. In a letter to the Ring-
tum Phi, two students suggested
their solution to the school’s ath-
letic problem: that Washington and
Lee purchase the Washington Red-
skin pro football team, hereafter
to be known as the Washington
and Lee Redskin Generals. ‘They
advised that the million-dollar cost
of buying the team could be classed
as an athletic expense, to be amor-
tized over a period of years, and
pointed out it would be a profitable
venture, since the team, with its
television network over the South,
always makes money. Any profits,
they declared, could be applied to
increasing the academic plant, rais-
ing faculty salaries, and supporting
other athletics.

The students said, by following
this plan, the University would still
have no subsidized athletes in our
enrollment, and could compete
with schools in other sports at no
financial loss. They pointed out the
great publicity value of the venture,
resulting in more interest in Wash-
ington and Lee, and possibly add1-

distinguished alumni were honored
by the student members of ODK,
who tapped them for membership
in the leadership fraternity in De-
cember. They were C. William
Streit, “10, a member of the Olym-
pic Executive Committee, and Ed-

Mr. Streit, originally scheduled
for initiation last year but prevent-
ed by illness, is one of the nation’s
leading figures in amateur athlet-

ics. He has been an active force in
promotion of track and field in the
Southeastern Conference, and has
served as president of the South-
eastern Amateur Athletic Union.
He has participated in more than
400 college football games as ref-
eree or other official. He is a mem-
ber of the twelve-man Honor Court
of the National Football Hall of
Fame, which selects former foot-
ball greats for the Hall of Fame.

Mr. Chittum has been in educa-
tional work ever since his gradua-
tion. He taught at several schools
before becoming high schools su-
pervisor for Norfolk County in
1944. For the past ten years, he has
held his present position. Last Oc-

B WASHINGTON AND LEE’S 210-year-
old history is a subject of great in-
terest, especially to school children,
but a recent request for informa-

A Colonial Heights, Virginia,
youngster, “‘very interested in the
academies in Virginia, though I
am a girl,’ wrote to “Liberty Hall
Academy, Lexington, Virginia,”’ for
pamphlets and other material. Of
course, Liberty Hall was changed
to Washington Academy in 1708,
in recognition of George Washing-
ton’s financial support of the
school. University officials mailed
the schoolgirl a brief history of
Washington and Lee University,
and a picture of the ruins of Liber-
ty Hall Academy. It was the best
they could do.

m THE TOWN OF LEXINGTON has been
given two strips of University prop-
erty to facilitate widening of two
Lexington streets. The university
is giving up eight feet, seven inches
of its property on Lee avenue, by
the Student Union, and four feet of
land along Washington street in
front of the new dining hall. ‘Town
officials requested the land as a
means toward greater traffic safety
along Lee avenue and Washington
street. Both areas will be scenes
of increased activity when Wash-
ington and Lee puts its new dining
and dormitory facilities into use
next September. Work on the street
project began in early March and
is expected to be completed soon.

degree from Columbia in 1923. He
was admitted to the New York Bar
in 1923, and entered the firm of
Simpson, Thatcher, and Bartlett
that same year.:In 1929, he became
a partner in the firm, a position he
still holds.

He is former president of the
New York Legal Aid Society, Bar
Association of New York City, and
is chairman of the American Ar-

# AN EIGHT-GAME 1959 _ football
schedule has been announced for
Washington and Lee University
by Athletic Director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly.

The slate is described by ‘I'wom-
bly as “the best schedule we've had
since our non-subsidized program
went into effect in 1954.

The new foes are Dickinson Col-
lege of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and
Carnegie Tech of Pittsburgh, with
both games slated for Washington
and Lee’s Wilson Field. ‘The Penn-
sylvania schools, whose athletic
policies are similar to Washing-
ton and Lee’s non-scholarship pro-
gram, replace Southern Illinois
University and Wittenberg College.
Washington and Lee has met
neither school in football before.

Last year, Coach Lee McLaugh-
lin’s Generals, composed largely of
freshmen and sophomores, turned
in a 1-7 record.

The schedule: September 26,
Centre, home; October 3, Dickin-
son, home; October 10, Franklin
and Marshall, away; October 17,
Randolph-Macon, home; October

m# WINTER SPORTS TEAMS at Wash-
ington and Lee ran the gamut of
success this year. There was a
winner—the swimmers, who turned
in their customary good showing
in winning six and losing just three
dual matches. There was a break-
even mark—the wrestlers, who won
five and lost five, and in doing so
showed promise of a return to
brighter days on the mats for the
Generals. And there was a loser—
the basketball team, playing with-
out grants-in-aid boys for the first
time in five years, which went 15

HANDBALL CHAMpPS—This is the faculty handball team which won the final contest of the

losing games before beating Ran-
dolph-Macon in the final contest
of the year.

For cage coach Bob McHenry,
the season was a study in frustra-
tion. The losses came hard, partic-
ularly the three overtime decisions
the Generals dropped to William
and Mary, Hampden-Sydney, and
Davidson. They played good ball,
but lacked rebound strength and
scoring depth.

Coach Cy Twombly’s swimmers,
hurt by the loss of backstroke ace
Pete Duncan through a shoulder
injury, nevertheless were strong
again this year. Displaying some un-
usual freshmen talent in Bill Deal
and Elliott Maynard, who set new
school records in the conventional
breaststroke, the Generals upset

Virginia Tech for their biggest tri-

umph. Losses to Virginia, Duke,
and Pittsburgh marred the record.
New freshmen recruits for wrest-

ling coach Dick Miller helped the
mat team to improve on its 2-8
1957-58 season. ‘The Generals were
very strong in the lower weights,
but lacked consistent performance
in the upper brackets. Captain Den-
nis Patton, 8-2 for the year, won the
Mathis Memorial Trophy as the
team’s outstanding performer.

Here’s a rundown of prospects
for the spring sports: Baseball—
good chance to improve on_ last
year’s 5-9 record, with soph Roy
Carpenter (4-4) back on the mound.
Track—Coach Lee McLaughlin’s
football boys should improve track
mentor Norm Lord’s hopes for a
winning season. Golf—all six regu-
lars return, plus some fine frosh
prospects. Tennis—enough veterans
return to assure another winning
season. Lacrosse—a pretty fair first
unit will have to go all the way, for
the Generals will lack depth for
the first time in years.

 

 

Dr. EDGAR F. SHANNON, JR., °39

HE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA has
eae a Washington and Lee
alumnus, Dr. Edgar Finley Shan-
non, Jr., as its next president. He
will take office during the summer,
succeeding former Virginia Gover-
nor Colgate W. Darden, Jr., who is
retiring after twelve years on the
job.

A former Rhodes scholar, Edgar
has been associate professor of
English at the University of Vir-
ginia since 1956. He was selected
as president by the trustees on Feb-
ruary 28, 1959, from a field of some
160 nominees. Governor Lindsay
Almond made a special trip to
Charlottesville that same day to
meet Edgar and to congratulate
him.

The new college president is an
internationally known scholar and
author in the field of Victorian lit-
erature. He has masters’ degrees

10

from both Duke Univer-
sity and Harvard Uni-
versity, and his doctor-
ate from Merton College
at Oxford. He is the au-
thor of numerous books,
articles and reviews. His
principal works are non-
historical, and deal with
critical writings on the
novel, — bibliographical
studies and works on Alfred Lord
Tennyson and his times. He is work-
ing on two books—an edition of
‘Tennyson’s letters which have been
made available to him by _ the
Tennyson family for editing, and a
sequel to an earlier volume entitled
‘Tennyson and the Reviewers.”
Things have been happening in
rapid succession to Edgar in the
past three years. In February 1956,
he was married to the former Elea-
nor Bosworth of Memphis, dean of
women at Southwestern College
there. He joined the Virginia facul-
ty later that year. The Shannons be-
came the parents of two small
daughters, Eleanor, in 1957, and
Elizabeth, on Christmas day, 1958,
and now they are preparing to
move from Hessian Hills to the
president’s mansion on Carr’s Hill.
Edgar is the son of the late Dr.
E. F. Shannon, who was professor
of English at Washington and Lee
for 24 years. The record shows that

Edgar, Jr., was an outstanding stu-
dent here, receiving <A’s on all
courses with the single exception of
a Bina Latin course. He was also
a half-mile track champion, vice-
president of the student body, pres-
ident of Beta Theta Pi, and presi-
dent of the Graham-Lee Literary
Society.

After being awarded his master’s
degree from Duke, he entered Navy
service in June, 1941, and was dis-
charged in 1946 as a heutenant
commander. He participated in
most of the major Pacific camp2igns
and witnessed the final surrender of
the Japanese in Tokyo bay. Upon
his discharge, he enrolled at Har-
vard’s graduate school, and won
a master’s degree in 1947. He be-
came a Rhodes scholar at Oxford
and received his Ph.D. degree there
in 1949. He was appointed to Har-
vard’s faculty in 1950 as an in-
structor and later became assistant
professor of English. In 1953-54, he
was given leave to return to Eng-
land for a year of research on
‘Tennyson. He continued at Har-
vard until his appointment to Vir-
ginia in 1956.

Edgar, now 40, will be the Uni-
versity’s fourth president. ‘Three
previous presidents have served for
an aggregate of fifty-five years. Prior

F ifty Years of

Fancy Dress Balls
Observed Here

N FIFTY YEARS of Fancy Dress

Balls at Washington and Lee,
countless hundreds of young men
and their dates have danced
through a colorful and elaborate
pageantry in costume. And _al-
though the times and the faces have
changed, the excitement generat-
ed by the balls through the years
has remained constant.

This year, the golden anniversary
of Fancy Dress was observed with
the theme, “Golden Jubilee: 1959.”
Decorations and costumes depicted
the highlights of eight of the most
successful Balls of the past. ‘These
sub-themes included the First Ken-
tucky Derby Ball, Mardi Gras, ‘The
World of Shakespeare, A Night in
Monte Carlo, Washington’s Inau-
guration, The Court of Louis XIV,
and King Arthur’s Court. Many
alumni will remember participat-
ing in these outstanding events.

Washington and Lee's’ Fancy
Dress Balls trace their beginning to
the inspiration of the school’s l-
brarian, Miss Annie Jo White, who
entertained a group of her student
friends with a costume party one
February evening in 1907.

Miss Annie sought to make the
affair an annual event, for she felt
students needed something to spark

WINTER 1959

the mid-winter dullness, particu-
larly following the rugged first-
semester examinations. It was
rough going at first, getting student
interest to respond, but she perse-
vered to the point that the entire
student body came to look upon
Fancy Dress as the highlight of the
school’s social calendar.

In fact, in 1928, the New York
Times described the ball as “the
South’s outstanding collegiate so-
cial event.’ Since that time, stories
and pictures of the event have ap-
peared in Life, Look and other na-
tional magazines, and numbers of
newspapers. Its music has been
broadcast on network radio hook-
ups to the entire nation.

Since 1916, the dances have been
held in  Doremus = gymnasium,
which has literally been trans-
formed for Fancy Dress by armies
of eager workers. In 1928, one
thousand people danced while four
hundred watched—the beginning of
an era in which Fancy Dress en-
joyed its greatest years and biggest
successes. During this time, a pro-
fessional decorator came from Bal-
timore to decorate the gymnasium,
and Van Horn’s of Philadelphia
brought down over $6,000 worth of
its finest costumes. Between eight

 

Miss ANNIE Jo WHITE

...She mothered the Fancy Dress Ball,

and maintained her interest in the event

until her death in 1938. She was always
an honored guest at each ball.

and ten thousand dollars was spent
annually on Fancy Dress—and in
the years when a dollar was worth
100 cents, too!

Mrs. L. J. Desha, who acted as
advisor, beginning in 1932, de-
clares, “Other than the Mardi Gras
balls in New Orleans, no other
social affair in the South ever at-
tempted to be so extravagant as
Fancy Dress. It was actually a theat-
rical performance.”

Fancy Dress was discontinued
during the World War II years,
but the balls were resumed in 1947.
‘Today, they may not be as elabo-
rate, or as glittering as they were in
the ’30’s, but the balls are still serv-
ing the same purpose for which the
first Fancy Dress was intended by
Miss Annie. it brightens the mid-
winter season, and it affords stu-
dents an opportunity for relaxation
and fun between exams and a new
semester.

who portrayed GENERAL LEE. During ex-
aminations, quite a few students let shav-
ing go, operating on the theory that, with
Fancy Dress coming up, a bewhiskered
face is fancier dress than a clean-shaven
one. When dates arrived, however, most
of the beards quickly dissappeared.

ary 30, 1959, although outfits
ranged all the way from bar-room

belles to bearded sultans. The cele-
bration began with a cocktail party
that afternoon, in honor of the
president of Fancy Dress, and cli-

afternoon jazz concert occupied stu-
dents and dates. For the first time
since the early ’20’s, a new profes-
sional costume company put the
“fancy” into the Friday ball, and
a good time was had by all.

man; Louisville, Kentucky, with
Edward Rietze, Jr., ’25, as chair-
man; Norfolk, William Ballard,

Virginia, with James E. McCaus-
land, °43, chairman.

Area campaigns are planned for
forty-four areas in the United States
where there is a concentration of
one hundred or more of the Wash-
ington and Lee family, made up of

alumni, parents, and friends. Ap-
proximately twenty of these areas
will have been covered before June,
and the remaining ones are slated
to be carried out in the fall.

President Francis P. Gaines has
keynoted the campaign dinners and
will cover about 25,000 miles in
his swing around the nation. This
is his last tour of alumni chapters
while holding the presidency of
Washington and Lee, and _ this
marks the “one last year of effort’’
he said he felt he owed the college
before he retires in the fall.

He spoke to 350 alumni, parents,
and friends in December in
the Lexington-Rockbridge area. In

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

mid-January, he met with 225 at a
dinner in Roanoke, and with 450
in Richmond. Over 200 attended
the alumni dinner in Charleston,
West Virginia in February, and
over 200 in Louisville, Norfolk, and
Lynchburg. In mid-March — he
flew to Texas to meet with Univer-
sity friends in Dallas and San An-
tonio. He is also scheduled for ad-
dresses to groups in Charlotte,
North Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia;
Jacksonville, Florida; Memphis,
Tennessee; Houston, Texas; New
Orleans, Louisiana; Shreveport,
Louisiana; Birmingham, Alabama;
Chattanooga, ‘Tennessee;  Balti-
more, Maryland; Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania; and Washington.

Organized campaigns follow each
of the area dinner meetings, and
from fifty to one hundred volun-
teer workers participate in each
campaign. During the capital fund
drive, a total of approximately
2,000 volunteer workers will be
actively taking part in the cam-
paign.

Organization in an area begins
six weeks prior to the date set for
Dr. Gaines’ report of the University
to alumni, parents, and_ friends.
During that period, the chairman
appoints division leaders and they
in turn appoint team captains who
ask alumni, parents and friends to
be members of their teams. One
week before the dinner, a_ sales
school is held for the workers. Ac-
tive solicitation begins the day af-
ter the dinner, and continues over
the next four weeks.

Washington and Lee expects at
least go per cent of the $2,000,000
goal by the end of 1959, according
to co-chairmen Lykes and Chenery.
‘They said a “‘very large measure of
success’ so far has been due to un-
usually high enthusiasm on the part
of alumni workers in the various
areas. In campaigns which have
been conducted thus far, seven out
of every ten alumni who have been
contacted personally have made
contributions.

What! No Letter from Class Agent?

ERHAPS SOME OF YOU HAVE WONDERED why you have not received
p the usual letter from your Class Agent regarding the 1958-59
Alumni Fund. We assure you the agents are not negligent. Here
is the explanation:

In January, 1958, after a long and extensive analysis and survey
study, the University Board of ‘Trustees approved the proposal to
engage in a University Development Program designed to raise
capital funds to meet the critical need for new instructional build-
ings. The operation of this program got into full swing in July,
1958.

From the very outset, it was established that the identity of
the Alumni Fund and the Parents’ Fund would be maintained
during the campaign and that for the initial phase they would be
merged with the University Development Program. Under these
plans, and to avoid duplicate solicitation, it was determined that
any gift from an alumnus or parent to the capital campaign would
also, and at the same time, be recorded as a contribution to those
respective funds.

The University Development Program is organized on a terri-
torial or area concept (as opposed to class). Each of the forty-four
areas will, in turn, have its own separate campaign. Accordingly,
the Class Agent was relieved, for this 1958-59 year, of the responsi-
bility for soliciting his classmates.

Therefore, though you have not received a solicitation memo
from your agent, he will be writing to you very shortly to tell
about the big Reunion of All Classes which will be held on campus
June 11-13 and the plans for your particular class.

University Appoints Proctor

HANGING CONDITIONS in college

work and life frequently de-
mand a revision of procedures, not
only in academic affairs, but in
student practices and modes of liv-
ing, and consequently, in Univer-
sity personnel.

One such development in staff
personnel at Washington and Lee
was reflected on January 2, 1959,
when Charles Fletcher Murray as-
sumed the new post of University
Proctor. Mr. Murray started to
work the same day to solve a series
of thefts, which occurred in the
freshman dormitory during the
Christmas vacation.

Through Mr. Murray’s efforts,
the culprit, a fifteen-year-old Jani-
tor’s helper, was apprehended.
While assisting a regular janitor to
clean the rooms during the holiday
season, the youth had been helping
himself to students’ radios, electric
razors, cuff links, fountain pens,
coats, and a watch. The items were
recovered the same day and re-
turned to the freshmen.

Some days later, Proctor Murray,
working with Lexington police, re-
covered $500 worth of property
stolen from student automobiles
parked on or near the campus. The
articles included a radio, typewrit-
er, and a quantity of clothing. The
thief was a Lexington juvenile.

Mr. Murray is a Lexingtonian, a
veteran of the United States Marine
Corps with four years of service in
World War II. He is thirty-seven
years old, and includes in his ex-
perience some years of effective ser-
vice with the local police force. As
Proctor, he serves as a non-uni-
formed official.

18

The installation of the office of
Proctor was a result of develop-
ments which took place last spring.
As has been related previously, the
faculty recognized the need for a
revision and adaption to recent de-
velopments of certain general prin-
ciples and procedures connected

 

Proctor C. F. MuRRAY

with student life and conduct.
These regulations went into effect
last fall, and the general verdict on
the campus and in the community
has been one of approval of the
goals sought, and the steps taken.
The transferral of responsibility
for fraternity conduct from the In-
terfraternity Council to the faculty,
through the office of Dean of Stu-
dents, demanded a study of the op-
erational machinery advisable. In-
quiry into conditions on the cam-
pi of a dozen or more colleges ap-
proximately comparable to Wash-
ington and Lee in size and nature,

indicated that Washington and Lee
was the only one of the group
which did not employ special staff
personnel to maintain satisfactory
conditions in social and non-aca-
demic affairs. These officials were
called variously watchmen, patrol-
men, or proctors. One or more col-
leges smaller than Washington and
Lee had as many as three or four
such staff members. Acting upon
the faculty’s recommendation, the
board of trustees created the posi-
tion of University Proctor, and Mr.
Murray was appointed.

Dean of Students Frank J. Gil-
liam stated: “The office of proctor
is not a punitive or judicial one.
While the proctor operates to as-
sist in the control of violations of
accepted modes of conduct, he will
have many opportunities of ren-
dering help to students—such as he
has already demonstrated in two
sets of thefts in which students were
the victims, in controlling offensive
conduct on the part of students
from other institutions, and in one
or more automobile accidents.”’

The Ring-twm Phi has editorial-
ly joined numerous individual stu-
dents in expression of approval of
Proctor Murray’s initial procedures
in the handling of his job.

In addition to his responsibility
in connection with general student
life, under the office of the Dean of
Students, the proctor will work on
campus traffic and parking prob-
lems resulting from the steadily in-
creasing number of automobiles. In
this work, the Proctor is under the
general direction of D. E. Brady,
37, Superintendent of buildings
and grounds.

ticing enough law on the Main Street of
Farmville to make a comfortable living,
Mr. Lancaster also enjoys fishing, hunting

newspaper refers to him as a lawyer giv-
ing “curb side service,” as he is more
often found in front of the bank building
on Main Street than in his office. Mr.
Lancaster’s wife died several years ago
after a lingering illness and he has lived
alone in Farmville since. He has _ no
children.

CoL. PAuL A. ROCKWELL was a delegate
to the Ottawa International Conference of
the English Speaking Union, representing
Asheville, North Carolina. In a report to
the Asheville chapter, he said there are
over nine thousand English-speaking boys
and girls who are exchange students in
our country now. “We all know that the
most faithful and lasting friendships are
those formed in youth,’ he declared. “If
we can gain the respect, affection and
friendship of those thousands of young
people who have come from other lands
to study in our schools and colleges, we
will have a treasure of infinite value, a
friendship and moral support for our
country that will last a lifetime. The
worst enemies we have in Europe, South
America, Asia, Africa, are people from
the so-called underdeveloped or colonial
countries who have been educated in our
schools but who were not received in
our midst as they hoped and expected
to be. The most relentless enemies we
have in Red China, for instance, are
graduates from American universities. In

20

the Rif War against Spain and France,
Moroco 1925, Abd el Krim, valorous lead-
er of the Rif mountaineer tribesmen, and
his brother were graduates from the
Spanish School of Mines. They felt while
studying in Madrid that they were shab-
bily treated by the Spaniards, and they
developed a bitter hatred for Europeans,
which actuated them to try to drive the
French and Spaniards out of their country.
Indians educated in English universities
led the movement to drive the British out
of India.” Colonel Rockwell believes that
if a country brings to its colleges young
future leaders from other nations to be
educated, but does not assimilate them
by taking them into the homes and hearts
of its people, it will make everlasting
enemies. “Let us all strive to win over not
only all the English-speaking exchange
students in our country, but all other
strangers in our midst as well. If we
have staunch friends abroad, our civiliza-
tion and our nation will survive.”

old. Thus, banking in Atlanta has become
a young man’s business. Far more signifi-

thinking in banking today which prevails
because it succeeds.
