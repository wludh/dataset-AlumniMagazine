A Film Story of General Lee

 

Washington and Lee alumni
and students will soon be viewing
a film based on the life and pub-
lic services of General Lee. The
picture, “Robert E. Lee: A Back-
ground Study,” has recently been
released by Coronet Instructional
Films of Chicago. Prepared pri-
marily for educational use in high
schools and colleges, it will be ap-
preciated and enjoyed by all who
might be interested in the great
Southern chieftain and the period
in which he lived and served. In
April a test print of the film was
shown to different groups on our
campus, and the response was en-
thusiastic. “Authentic, dignified,
and impressive” were among the
words used to describe it.

In this film no actor represents
Lee, nor are historical scenes or
events reenacted. The story is told

by an “interpretative blending of

scenes, buildings, portraits and
statues, relics, maps, and Lee’s
own writing—which in themselves
serve to recreate “Lee: ‘All. the
scenes are skillfully tied together
by an excellent commentary which
reveals the story of Lee’s life.
Washington and Lee is inev-
itably interested in any book or
film which concerns General Lee,
but we have a special interest in
this film. The scenes begin and end
at Washington College and empha-
size the great service the general
rendered to the college, the South,

2

By ALLEN W. MocGeEr

and the Nation during
those last five years of
his life. Our students ap-
pear in several scenes,
much of the film was shot
here, and the writer has
had a lot of fun collabor-
ating with the company
in production of the film.

As a young man (Pete
Doyle of Florida, repre-
senting the thousands
who pay their respects at Lee’s
tomb every year) approaches the
chapel and the recumbent statue
of Lee, the narrator begins: “In the
chapel of Washington and Lee Un-
iversity in the heart of Virginia lies
the body of Robert E. Lee. From
all over the world men come to
do honor to this defender of a civil-
ization that is gone from our land—
g¢one—and yet living forever in the
name and memory of its finest son.
Many men have won greatness in
victory; Robert E. Lee achieved
greatness in defeat. His greatness
was measured when his mother
state split from the Union he loved.
His greatness was measured when,
the war lost, the people of the South
looked to him to point the way.”

After the story of Lee’s life the
scene returns to Washington Col-
lege: “Even in defeat, the great
victory was his, for, he said, “There
is a true glory and a true honor:
the glory of duty done—the honor
of the integrity of principle.’ ‘In-
tegrity of principle’ directed Lee,
after the war, to the grounds of
Washington College (impressive
shot of the columns of the central
building at W&L). This home in
Virginia he chose over a proffered
estate in England, saying, “The
thought of abandoning the country
...1S abhorrent to my feelings.’
This humble office he occupied
after turning down positions of
great honor, prestige, and fortune

because he held it the duty of
every citizen ‘to do all in his power
to aid in the restoration of peace
and harmony and in no way to op-
pose the policy of the State or
General Governments, directed to
that object’ (letter accepting presi-
dency of Washington College).
Thus Robert E. Lee, the com-
mander who had led the people of
the old South through the war be-
came the college president (shot
of portrait as college president in
Dr. Gaines’ office) who set an ex-
ample for the new South by taking
a small impoverished school and
building it into a great institution
of learning. This is his memorial
(impressive view of W&L cam-
pus )—a university which has for-
ever linked his name with that of
his hero, George Washington. Lee
has returned to the soil of Vir-
ginia. But, now he belongs to the
nation, the common heritage of
young men from every section
(shot of several young men visiting
the Valentine statue of Lee) who
may well follow his example and
take to heart his words: “Truth and
manliness are two qualities that
will carry you through this world
much better than policy, or tact, or
expediency, or any other word that
was devised to conceal or mystify a
deviation from a straight line.’ Here
there was no mystery—no deviation
from the path of Christian duty.”

In the story of his life before
1861 Lee is presented as the de-
vout Christian who learned self-
control and Christian forbearance
from his mother, and as a born
Virginian who had served his na-
tion well and whose belief in states
rights was a part of his belief in
the Union. Material which a single
observer would find difficult to ob-
tain is correlated and richly pre-
sented in order to place Lee in
the period in which he lived.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

Amid the dissention of sectional
conflict Lee prayed that it would
be possible “to extinguish fanati-
cism North and South, cultivate
love for the country and Union,
and restore harmony between the
different sections.” On other occa-
sions he wrote: “In this enlightened
age there are few, I believe, but
what will acknowledge that slavery
as an institution is a moral and po-
litical evil in any country .. . Their
emancipation will sooner result
from the mild and melting influ-
ence of Christianity, than the
storms and tempests of fiery
controversy.” “I can anticipate no
greater calamity for the country
than a dissolution of the Union.
It would be an accumulation of
all the evils we complain of, and I
am willing to sacrifice everything
but honor for its preservation.”
But the Union was disrupted and
Lee, the Virginian, was forced
to make the painful “decision he
was born to make” because “I could
take no part in the invasion of the
Southern States.”

The story of the war is told by |

animated maps and battle scenes.
One scene was made with the co-
operation of Colonel Barksdale and
some cadets at the Virginia Muili-
tary Institute studying Lee’s strat-
egy. A realistic scene of a Con-
federate camp toward the end of
the war shows tired, hungry, dirty,
wounded, and shabby troops
around camp fires and tents sud-
denly rise to their feet In an open
display of affection and trust as
General Lee rides into camp on

Traveller. The participants in this.

scene were Washington and Lee
students dressed in Confederate
uniforms rented from a house in
Chicago. The site was on the edge
of an old quarry west of Buena
Vista where no telephone lines or
other modern impediments marred
the view. Authentic Civil War
rifles were borrowed from the mu-
seum at V. M. I., and Southern
Seminary provided a gray horse to
serve as ‘Traveller, whose head
only appears before the camera as

Lee rides by. The rider is now Mrs.
Robert Mish of Lexington.

The author of the script and the
producer of the film was Richard
P. Creyke of Coronet Instructional
Films. Born in Farmville, Virginia,
Mr. Creyke has been a life-long
admirer of General Lee, and the
making of the film was his idea
in the beginning. Most of the
scenes were made in May and June
of 1952 when the director, Gilbert
Altschul, and two assistants visited
Lexington and other places in Vir-
ginia with full equipment for the
job. Jack Willcoxon, a senior at
Washington and Lee, helped in
making up the students who ap-
peared in the camp scene.

This is a 16mm sound film about
fifteen minutes in length, and it is
available in colors or black and
white. Primarily intended for in-
structional purposes in schools and
colleges, it will provide informa-
tion for many who are not too well
informed concerning General Lee’s

unique and influential place in his-
tory. Purchases can be made from
Coronet Instructional Films, Cor-
onet Building, Chicago 1, Illinois,
and the picture can be rented from
film libraries all over the nation. Cy
Young has a copy of the color print
which he plans to show at alumni
meetings. It should be especially
effective for use when alumni as-
sociations are entertaining pros-
pective Washington and Lee stu-
dents.

It has been a genuine pleasure
for the writer to cooperate from the
beginning with Mr. Creyke and
others of the Coronet company in
the preparation of the script and
the Teachers’ Guide which is fur-
nished with the film, and in the
shooting for the scenes here at
Washington and Lee. No group of
men could have been more co-
operative and pleasant, and a more
authentic interpretation of General
Lee would be difficult to produce.
We hope you too will like it. _

 

New duPont Gift Announced

Mrs. Alfred I. duPont has given
Washington and Lee a new gift
worth approximately $170,000,
President Francis P. Gaines has
announced.

Mrs. duPont, who has contrib-
uted generously to Washington
and Lee, Hollins College, and the
University of the South, increased
her gifts to the institutions by
5,200 shares of du Pont stock.

Washington and Lee and the
University of the South share
equally in the latest gift. Hollins
College’s share is approximately
$150,000.

With the announced increase of
the shares of stock, Mrs. duPont’s
gifts to the three institutions now
total 32,200 shares with a market
value of more than $3,000,000,
Dr. Gaines said.

Mrs. duPont has been a bene-
factor of Washington and Lee for
a number of years. Her gifts to

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

the Bicentennial financial program
several years ago exceeded
$200,000.

 

1953 SIPA Convention
Largest Yet; 865 Attend

This year’s Southern Interschol-
astic Press Association convention,
attended by 865 delegates, was the
largest ever sponsored at Washing-
ton and Lee.

Among the many outstanding
speakers present for the Journalism
Foundation-sponsored event were
Elmer Davis, noted news commen-
tator; novelist James Street, author
of Tap Roots, and The Gauntlet;
King Feature cartoonist Stan
Drake; Frank Fehlman, New York
advertising counsel; and many
other prominent newspaper men.

The convention, an annual event
for 24 years, is a standout feature
in the South.

W. and L. Becomes Model Rail Center

Lexington’s dream of becoming
the most important rail center be-
tween Pittsburgh and Atlanta is
long forgotten, but this quiet col-
lege town is rapidly becoming the
center of model railroading in Vir-
oinla.

Interest in model railroading
here owes its birth to the Generals’
Short Line Association, a model
rail fan club formed a little over
a year ago under the sponsorship
of the ROTC Transportation Corps
unit.

Members of the Association, like
all true rail fans, eat, sleep, and
breath railroading. Most of their
spare time is spent reading litera-
ture on railroading, watching
movies on railroading, taking rail-
road excursions, and working on
their own model rail system in a
remarkably square “roundhouse”
behind the gym.

An air of informality character-
izes the organization of the rail
club. There are no dues and no
membership lists. All rail fans in
Lexington are invited to partici-
pate in the Short Line’s activities.
Lt. Col. Richard W. Jones, Jr.,
commanding officer of the ROTC
unit and sponsor of the Short Line
Association, said the club’s activ-
ities were carried on by about 35
“more or less active” students. In
addition to students, faculty mem-
bers and their children are always
dropping by to see films about rail-
roading or to watch the model
trains.

Movies about railroads and sub-
jects connected with railroading
are shown at the Association’s
meetings every Monday night.
After the movies, club members
usually go to the “roundhouse” to
work on the club’s elaborate model
railroad system.

Mainstay in the system, and only
road now under construction, is
the Rockbridge and Pacific, an
“HO” gauge model railroad adver-
tised by Short Line members as

4,

“The Road of Southern Comfort.”
In the blueprint stage is the Shen-
andoah Southern, an “O” guage
line designed to go “Through the
Core of the Apple Country.” Also
still in the planning stage is the
Blue Ridge Intermountain 'Trac-
tion Line, a future “S” guage over-
head electrified line known as “The
Up and Over Line, High Wheels—
High Speed.”

All tracks, trains, and other
equipment in the Generals’ Short
Line system is constructed to a
very exact scale. With “O” guage
equipment the scale is one-fourth
of an inch to a foot. The scale on
the “HO” guage is one-half that—
one-eighth of an inch to a foot. “S”
gcuage is halfway between the “O”
and “HO” guages—three-sixteenths
of an inch on the model railroad
represents one foot on a standard
railroad.

When completed, the Rock-
bridge and Pacific will wind
through the entire “roundhouse.”
The R&P will consist of four di-
visions: a metropolitan division
with passenger and freight termi-
nals, a roundhouse, and a complete

— rail yard; a mountain division with

scale model mountains of various
orades; a desert division; and a port
division with more yards and facil-
ities for loading and unloading
cars. |

Cars, locomotives, track, and
track-side scenery are constructed
from model kits by members of the
Association. Most of the equipment
is personally owned by the mem-
bers. At present the rolling stock
of the Rockbridge and Pacific con-
sists of one road engine, one diesel,
two general purpose switchers, a
dock-side switcher, and a number
of freight and passenger cars.

When completed the Rockbridge
and Pacific will have automatic
switches handled from a single
central control point and a fully
automatic traffic signal and con-
trol system. This will prevent

trains from entering a section of
track guarded by a red signal.

The complex wiring and elec-
tronic systems necessary for these
controls are being installed by
members of the club as work on the
the rails progresses.

Work on the first major loop of
of the Rockbridge and Pacific is ex-
pected to be completed by June.
Completion of the entire R&P sys-
tem with all its auxiliary lines,
yards, siding, signals, and land-
scaping is not expected for about
two years. Work on the Shenan-
doah Southern and the Blue Ridge
Intermountain Traction Line may
begin before the finishing touches
are put on the Rockbridge and
Pacific.

Major problem facing the Short
Line Association before these two
systems can be built is where to
put them. Members are hopeful of
eventually expanding into a second
room in the “roundhouse” now
used by the ROTC band.

While work is progressing on
the main line of the Rockbridge
and Pacific, members are using a
small “O” gauge set owned by
Colonel Jones to work out prob-
lems of making up trains, switch-
ing them, and cutting cars out of
one train and joining them to an-
other.

Members of the Short Line are
divided into three groups: Those
interested primarily in planning
and constructing the track,
switches, and track-side scenery;
those mainly interested in_ build-
ing the model cars and locomo-
tives; and those whose chief inter-
est lies in operating the model
trains.

The operating group meets every
Friday afternoon and dons caps
of railroad engineers, dispatchers,
or switchmen. An elaborate switch-
ing problem involving exchanging
several cars between different trains
is set up. the dispatcher thinks
over the problem, then gives orders

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

to the engineer and switchmen.
“Brownies,” or demerits, are given
to the dispatcher for the wrong di-
rection; to the enginer for derail-
ment, bumping cars, or collision;
and to the switchmen for failure
to throw the right switches at the
right time. Winner of the after-
noon’s problem is the man who
comes out with the least number
of “brownies.”

“Most people think of a model
train as something to run around a
Christmas tree,” Colonel Jones
said. “Very few ever realize the
many intricate things that can be
done with a model railroad that
has a couple of switches.”

Over-all purpose of the Gener-
als’ Short Line Association, as de-
fined by Colonel Jones, is to “re-
store a consciousness of the im-
portance of transportation at
Washington and Lee.” Colonel
Jones points out that Washington
was very interested in canals, the
major means of transportation in
his time, and that Lee was a very
active supporter of the Valley Rail-
road, designed to run from Harp-
-er’s Ferry through Lexington to
Salem. |

As a means of stimulating this
interest, the Association has ac-
quired a collection of books and
periodicals on railroading and its
history as well as several paint-
ings and photographs of famous
locomotives of the past. Included
in the collection of photographs
are pictures of the Baltimore
and QOhio’s locomotive, President
Washington, and the Richmond,
Fredericksburg, and Potomac’s

General Lee. The picture of the >

General Lee, now retired from ac-
tive service, was taken especially
for the Generals’ Short Line As-
sociation.

In the collection of paintings is
the George Washington, put in
service in 1837 by the Columbia
Incline (now part of the Pennsyl-
vania Railroad System) and_be-
lieved to be the first locomotive
named after Washington. Also in-
cluded is a painting of The Gen-

ginia, and president of the Generals’ Short Line Association, is shown above as he

eral, famous locomotive captured
by Northern spies during the Civil
War and used in an attempt to
cut the line of supply of Beaure-
gard’s army.

Periodicals in the club’s library
include all of the major railroad-
ing and model railroading maga-
zines of the United States as well
as some published in England,
France, and Australia.

Walls of the club’s “roundhouse”
are covered with color pictures of
old and new locomotives, mostly
taken from calendars and adver-
tisements of various railroads.

Ranky Kean, senior from Rich-
mond, Virginia, is president and
chief construction engineer of the
Short Line Association. Pete Craw-
ford, junior from Gaylord, Vir-
ginia, is secretary.

And so, though Lexington’s
hopes of becoming a southern Chi-
cago died when the Valley Rail-
road went bankrupt before it
reached Salem, the Rockbridge
and Pacific may one day link a
scale model Lexington with a scale
model Pacific—50O feet away.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Chicago Meeting

The Chicago chapter of the
Washington and Lee Alumni As-
sociation held a most successful
dinner meeting at the University
Club on Tuesday evening, March

Intramural Program Is Purposeful

Like Saturday’s hero on the in-
tercollegiate scene, every frater-
nity has its “week-end” hero, the
amateur athlete who scored the
winning basket against the hated
rivals from the house across the
street.

The intramural race at Wash-
ington and Lee is fierce. The sys-
tem is so broad that every student
has the chance to be a “hero” some-
time during his collegiate career,
the tempo of competition so intense
that it couldn’t be increased with-
out hurting some other aspect of
college life. Approximately 78 per
cent of the student body takes
part in the program which in-
cludes 12 team sports and a num-
ber of individual contests.

Purpose of the intramural sys-
tem is three-fold: to stimulate par-
ticipation in team and individual
activities, to give everybody a
chance to compete in athletics as
a form of recreation, and to give
the students healthy exercise.

To aid in the program the Uni-
versity is fortunate to have a full
time intramural director, Norm
Lord, who supervises an intricate
organization of student helpers.
Heading up the student adminis-
trative body is an intramural
manager. This manager also is a
member of the intramural board

which includes Norm Lord, the di-

rector of physical education, and
two elected students. The board is
responsible for the over-all direc-
tion of the program. Under the
board the organization splits into
three parts: admihistration, of-
ficials association, and the Intra-
mural Manager’s Council.

This council consists of 18 stu-
dents, one representative from each
team. The administration board,
which takes care of the equipment
and plans the competition, consists
of one freshman from each team,
10 sophomores selected from the
previous year’s freshmen, four

6

juniors, and finally one senior—
who is the student intramural man-
ager.

The program itself is divided
into three seasons: Fall, winter and
spring. The fall season includes
touch football, tennis, and bowling.
The winter is divided into two
phases, the first phase including
handball, table tennis, and basket-
ball. The second phase _ has volley-

ball, wrestling, and swimming. In
the spring the sports schedule turns
to track, softball, and golf. In ad-
dition sports carnivals in the spring
provide a chance for individual
star athletes to win points for their
teams.

Competition is run on a round-
robin tournament basis. The 18
teams are divided into four leagues,
which compete within themselves

Intramural Team Standings

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

to see who goes to the finals. An-
other round-robin tournament is
then played among the four survi-
vors to determine the University
champion. A trophy is awarded the
winning team and all-tournament
teams are selected in each sport to
add interest.

The point system for the pro-
gram is intricate, with the empha-
sis on competition rather than
winning. Each fraternity entering
a team automatically receives 50
points. The winner of a league re-
celves 30 more while the grand
champion receives a total of 100.
Points are deducted for forfeits, in-
fringement of rules, and failure of
the teams to cooperate in their
share of the administration of the
program.

Sports are varied as the occa-
sion demands. Last year billiards,
archery, and horseshoes were on
the agenda and future years may
find other activities as a part of
the program.

The faculty has found the com-
petition an ideal way to check the
advances of middle-age, and to in-
crease informality with the stu-
dents. This year they entered a
volleyball team in the tournament
and promise to enter other sports
in the future.

Norm Lord is the first to say
the program is not perfect. Limited
facilities shorten the seasons. A
limited budget cuts down on the
equipment and students participat-
ing in most sports must provide
their own. There is no towel sys-
tem whereby participants can
draw a clean towel for a shower
following a work-out. No pay is
provided for officials and this pro-
vides little incentive for capable
students to give up their free time
for this most necessary function.

The faculty has accused the
tempo of the program as being so
great that it has hurt studies, but
after discussion the Intramural
Board was able to prove that the
top intramural athlete in each fra-
ternity was not in any manner lack-
ing good grades, nor was the

fraternity leading the competition
the lowest academically.

A freshman can participate in
only one intramural sport per sea-
son. Upperclassmen may partici-
pate in two sports if their grade
point ratio is 1.4. A Dean’s list
man can participate in three.

Varsity coaches have occasion-
ally found the intense competition
between fraternities hurting their
teams. Star athletes sometimes pre-
fer to play for intramural teams
rather than the intercollegiate. The
solution has been a rewarding of
points for the team members par-
ticipating on University varsities,
and a black list banning from in-
tramurals those deemed capable of
varsity competition.

Eligibility for the teams is
closely watched to prevent frater-
nities from padding their teams.
No varsity squad man is eligible
for intramurals in his particular
sport or sports.

A physical is required of all
those planning to play intramurals
for the protection of the individual.

Norm Lord says his ambition
is to keep the system at its pres-
ent high level, with intramural and
intercollegiate athletics comple-
menting and supplementing each
other for the betterment of the stu-
dent body.

 

Journalism School
Receives Giits

The Lee Journalism Foundation
continued its expansion this year
through the generosity of two
gifts. The donations make possible
24-hour ticker-tape news service,
and a course in movie-making.

Telegraphic news around-the-
clock service has been added to
the facilities of the Lee Memorial
Journalism Foundation.

O. W. Riegel, director of the
Foundation, said acquisition of the
day and night news report, which
is used by a number of journalism
classes, was made possible by gifts

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

from a group of ten Virginia daily
newspaper companies.

Gifts by these newspaper com-
panies supplemented the Frank
Fuller Fund, established last year
by Dr. Douglas Southall Freeman,
former editor of the Richmond
News Leader, to provide journal-
ism students with a basic wire
service. Dr. Freeman established
the fund with a gift of $500 in
honor of Fuller, who as chief of
the Richmond Bureau of the As-
sociated Press was marking his
25th anniversary of AP service.

The telegraphic copy includes
up-to-the-minute news from all
points on the globe. The service is
the same as that used by many
of the daily newspapers in Vir-
ginia. Students process the copy
during laboratory periods, writing
headlines and correcting and trim-
ming where necessary while mak-
ing up dummy layouts of news-
paper front and inside pages.

Radio news students use wire
copy in preparing their daily 15-
minute world and local news pro-
eram, broadcast each evening
through the facilities of the Lex-
ington radio station.

The movie-making course was
made possible through a gift of
valuable equipment given by Mr.
and Mrs. Russell Applegate of
Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.

Purpose of the course will be to
familiarize students with the tools,
techniques, values, and production
standards of motion pictures, in
connection with the department’s
objective of acquainting students
with both press and non-press
media of communication.

The faculty of the Foundation
this semester includes Riegel, C. O.
Voigt, Jr., and C. Harold Lauck;
William Atkinson, managing edi-
tor of the Roanoke Times, who
teaches copy editing; William G.
Leverty, chief of the copy desk of
the Richmond Times-Dispatch,
who teaches advanced reporting,
and Herbert Patchin, laboratory in-
structor in photography.

William L. Lord, ’07

William L. Lord, ‘O77,
Will Retire This Month

WittiamM LELAND Lorp, A.B.
07, M.A. ’?09—“Uncle Billy” to
two generations of Woodberry
Forest boys, to whom he has taught
mathematics for 36 years—will re-
tire in June and settle down to
peace and quiet in a new home he
and Mrs. Lord and their daughter
Louise have built in Orange, four
miles from the school.

William Leland Lord is the
fourth generation of Lord educa-
tors. His great-grandfather was
president of Darthmouth College
for many years until 1863, but
being one of those rare individuals
known as a Yankee Southern sym-
pathizer, he withdrew for a more
congenial atmosphere. His son be-
came a teacher, but for a short
time only. The third generation
was represented by William Gay
Lord, who when young Leland was
2, bought Bellwood Seminary in
Anchorage, Kentucky, and it was
amidst the bevy of young lady
boarders at this school that Leland
Lord grew up.

He says now that the only dif-
ficulty he ever experienced in this
exotic environment was that he
fell in love with all the girls who
cuddled him until their real beaux

LO

 

appeared, whereat the sub-teen suf-
fered agonies of jealousy. When
he had graduated, at 16, his father
sent him off to Washington and
Lee, where he took his A.B. de-
gree in three years instead of four,
and then decided to study engi-
neering. After a year of that, he
discovered it was not what he
wanted and remained a fifth year
to take his master’s degree.

When he left Washington and
Lee, armed with two degrees, he
taught for seven years in a day
school for boys in Nashville, Ten-
nessee.

In 1916 he went to Woodberry,
beginning one of the longest single
careers of anyone connected with
the school. He was married to Miss
Georgie Hume in 1917, whom he
had met while in Nashville. Dur-
ing these years, he has had three
conspicuous avocations, the Pres-
byterian Church, the Boy Scouts,
and the Rotary Club.

ticle appearing in The Times Dispatch

Burton A. Farber, ‘32,
Cincinnati Musician.

BurTON A. FarBer, 732, has
been so much a part of Cincinnati’s
musical life that some young peo-
ple think he has been there since
music began. Actually he is only in
his upper 30’s and came to the
Queen City to join WLW in 1943.
As a WLW musical director he
is a very talented fellow at a key-
board or in front of a band.

Burt has not only done TV and
radio work but also has led his
own orchestra at so many proms,
parties and public dancing spots
that Cincinnatians who _ haven’t
glided to his music-making are few
and far between. He has made ap-
pearances with the Chicago Sym-
phony Orchestra, playing works of
Gershwin, his favorite composer.

Mr. Farber has a national repu-
tation as well as a local one.
Throughout the years he has
journeyed to Chicago and New

York to help out in the big leagues.
Lately he has been commuting to
New York where he is employed
by a talent agency to choose and
arrange numbers for singers sche-
duled for appearances in top New
York hotels, and also has been
helping a new recording artist
work his way into jukebox promi-
nence.

Burt is married to a Southern
lady who, he says, goes to bed with
a cook book instead of a detective
novel. Her way with a dish is such
that he’s usually planning to take
off a few pounds but seldom does.
They have one son, Cliff, who is
studying law. Address: 909 Reilly
Road, Wyoming, Cincinnati 12,
Ohio.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

 

The above picture (received too late to be included in the March issue of the Alumni Magazine) was taken at a luncheon

meeting at the Hotel Peabody in Memphis on February 12 in connection with Dean’s Gilliam’s trip through the South, as

reported in the March issue. The group includes parents of present students and a few alumni who had secured a list of high

school students who would be regarded as good prospects for Washington and Lee. On the same evening there was a dinner
at the Memphis Country Club for prospective students and their parents.

 

whose term will expire December
31, 1953.

Seldom do the predictions of the
future of graduates in college an-
nuals come true as they have in
Bill Tuck’s case. We quote from
the 1921 Calyx of that year. “It is
not only predicted by the members
of his class but it is conceded by
the entire student body that no
man has a more promising future
as a Statesman than ‘Bill’ Tuck.”

Tuck has held office for almost

 

William M. Tuck, ’21

27 of his 56 years. He served in
the State Legislature as Delegate
and Senator, became Lieutenant-
Governor and then Governor of
Virginia, 1946-50.

Following his term as Gover-
nor, Tuck retired to his 600 acre
“High Hill Farm” near South Bos-
ton in Halifax County, with its
cattle and tobacco. One of the big-
gest lures of the country for him
is his Buckshoal Cabin, a well-
equipped retreat with a cutoff
switch on the telephone, where a
man could go to meditate and
listen to the soothing fiddle music
of Old Jack Rollins. Rollins came
to prospect for gold and copper
years ago and “stuck around.”
Tuck says he’s just going to take
his seat in the House, listen and as-
similate, digest and formulate. But
like the country boy he likes to call
himself, his path is bound to pass
a hornet’s nest, and Tuck can
hardly ever pass a hornet’s nest
without at least a tentative prod
at it.

While at Washington and Lee
Congressman Tuck was a member
of Sigma Phi Epsilon, social fra-

ternity, and Phi Delta Phi, legal
fraternity.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

 

Varsity-Alumni
Football Game

Eleven members of the cham-
pionship Southern Conference foot-
ball team of 1950 started for Gil
Bocetti’s alumni team April 18, in
a regular game scrimmage against
the 1953 edition of the Big Blue.

Bocetti, former All-Southern
signal-caller of 1950-51, started
as quarterback. Walt Michaels,
now a member of the Cleveland
Browns, filled his old shoes as
fullback. Wes Abrams and Randy
Broyles, who finished 1-2 in the
Southern Conference for rushing
yardage gained last fall, ran from
the halfback positions.

Jim Carpenter and Bob Gold-
smith started at ends; Jack Dela-
hunty and Don Fergusson at tack-
les; Charlie Smith, a converted
tackle, and Dick Schaub, were at
the guards; and Joe McCutcheon,
now in the army at Fort Eustis,
centered the ball.

Opposing the _ star-studded
Alumni squad was an all veteran
Washington and Lee team which
had just completed 20 days of
spring practice. Joe Lindsey, Har-

11

vey Lee Hill, Eddie Landis, and
Ciro Barcellona, opened in the var-
sity backfield.

The final score was 19-13 in
favor of the “old men” of the
Alumni, but Coach Carl Wise had
something to smile about as his
youngsters nearly made off with a
deadlock against their experienced
and heavier opponents. Guard
Dick Schaub pulled the game out
for the Alumni when he grabbed
a Varsity fumble in the last quar-
ter and raced 30 yards to paydirt.

Included among the oldtimers
who played in the game were
Charlie Harrington and Jim Stark.

 

7 Schools Drop Out of

Southern Conference

In a surprise move late this
spring, seven large members of
the Southern Conference dropped
off to form their own league. Those
seceding are: South Carolina,
Duke, North Carolina State, Clem-
son, University of Maryland, Uni-
versity of North Carolina and
Wake Forest.

The name of the new confer-
ence has not yet been chosen but
it will be in operation next fall.

Those remaining in the Con-
ference with Washington and Lee
are: William and Mary, Davidson,
Furman, Citadel, George Wash-
ington, Richmond, Virginia Maili-
tary Institute, and West Virginia.
At the close of the school year,
West Virginia was reported anx-
ious to join the new conference.

Reason for the split has not been
specifically given but it is believed
financial reasons motivated it in
part. Differences in the sizes of the
schools in the old Conference with
the resulting disagreement on the
number of scholarships allowed
and rules interpretations have also
been advanced as reasons.

The new conference is expected
to take part in bowl games, while
the old Conference, in an attempt
to curb athletic expenses in com-
parison to academic expenses, will
curb scholarships and probably al-

12

low freshmen participation in var-
sity sports.

“Cap'n” Dick Smith, old man
of the Washington and Lee ath-
letic world, said the new split will
aid the Generals as they will be
up against more equal competition.
“The new conference has a differ-
ent approach to the game,” he said,
“Washington and Lee will stick to
the traditional Southern Confer-
ence. We want an educational in-
stitution, not an academic club.”

 

J. Somerville, ‘12, To Be

Foreign Representive

Burns and Roe, Inc, Engineers
and Constructors at 233 Broad-
way, New York City, have an-
nounced the appointment of JAMES
SOMERVILLE, B.A. 712, M.A. 713,
as Foreign Representative. Mr.
Somerville has had many years of
experience as an expert on foreign
economic, trade, and commercial
matters.

Immediately prior to his present
position, Mr. Somerville, as a For-
elon Service Officer of the Depart-
ment of State, was on special as-
signment in Washington, serving
as a Consultant on foreign eco-
nomic development. From 1944-49
he was stationed in Jran—attached
to the American Embassy as First
Secretary and Principal Eco-
nomic Officer. He also served as
Charge d’Affaires (1948-49). Dur-
ing World War II, Mr. Somer-
ville was on the staff of the Amer-
ican Embassy in London as First
Secretary and Liaison Officer with
the British Ministry of Economic
Warfare, and also as Director of
the Embassy’s Economic Warfare
Division. Other assignments have
included that of Assistant Com-
mercial Attache with the American
Embassy in London (1935-41) and
Trade Commissioner (1929-35 ) —
also in London.

Mr. Somerville’s career has been
interesting and varied. Following
his graduation from Washington
and Lee University (B.A. 1912,
M.A. 1913), he spent three years

 

 

James Somerville, ’12

as Headmaster in a boys’ prepara-
tory school. In 1920 he did gradu-
ate work in economics at Johns
Hopkins University. After being
disqualified on physical grounds for
military service in 1917, he en-
gaged in relief and rehabilitation
work in the famine stricken areas of
Russia, first with the Interna-
tional Committee of the Y.M.C.A.
(1917-21), and then with the
American Relief Administration
(1921-23). This was followed by
many years service with the Bureau
of Foreign and Domestic Com-
merce and with the State Depart-
ment, including tours of duty as
Chief of the Russian Section of the
Bureau of Foreign and Domestic
Commerce (1928-29) and Director
of the Eastern European Division
of the Office of International ‘Trade
(1950-51).

 

Hyman and McMullen
Hold ‘Confab’ in Texas

On a recent trip to Texas, WIL-
LiaAM A. Hyman, ’13, was greeted
by his old friend of college days,
CLEMENTS McMULLEN, 711.

A brilliant Air Force career,
both as a pilot and administrator,
has brought Major General Clem-
ents McMullen to command the
San Antonio Air Materiel Area,
with headquarters at Kelly Field

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

AFB. On October 20, 1952, he
completed 35 years of service with
the Air Force.

He was an officer-pilot in World
War I, and after the war, having
become enamoured with flying, he
continued in the army as a flying
officer. Since that time he has serv-
ed in many places and capacities
which army service prescribes,
having visited and flown in all
continents except Africa and Aus-
tralia. in October, 1948, he re-
turned once more to Kelly Air
Force Base as Commanding Gener-
al of the San Antonio Materiel
Area, the position he now holds.

Still an expert and active pilot,
General McMullen flies his own
plane when he travels. He is rated
by the Air Force as Command Pi-

lot, and as a Combat Observer and
a Technical Observer, and one of
the nation’s top authorities on mili-
tary supply and aircraft main-
tenance.

His 35 years of service in the
Air Force was climaxed by a cele-
bration at which he was presented
with a hand-made tea table that
was constructed by members of the
2899th Depot Training Group.

While General McMullen has
been making his mark in Texas,
William Hyman has been achiev-
ing a like success as a member of
the New York bar. William has re-
ceived recognition for his work in
the field of international law and in
the field of insurance law. Not long
ago the Insurance Advocate paid
him high tribute for the great ser-

vice he rendered as counsel for the
Aetna Casualty and Surety Com-
pany in a case before the United
States Supreme Court. The deci-
sion in this important case over-
threw the doctrine of sovereign im-
munity and gave the insurance
companies the right to sue the goy-
ernment without permission.

William is Chairman of the
Board of Governors of the Brook-
lyn-Manhattan Trial Counsel As-
sociation composed of more than
four hundred lawyers. He is Chair-
man, also, of the New York Sym-
phony Orchestra.

 

History Repeats .

The class was graduating and
the class orator had a few words
for them and the times they were
about to meet. Listen to him:

“As the sons of this venerable

her priceless legacy, she has the
right to look to us for aid and sup-
port in the accomplishment of the
noble purposes to which she is
dedicated. And it is only through
the aid of her sons that she will
be able to maintain the proud po-

“Our country, too, stretches out
her hands to us in her hour of
peril.... The genius of the temp-
est is abroad. Error has marshalled
her hosts on every hand, and,
standing with defiant front, chal-
lenges truth to the encounter....
With the spirit of Communism dis-
gcuised under the specious names
of civil rights and labor reform, she
would have us disregard the mel-
ancholy example of France and re-
peat the experiment of her stupen-
dous folly.”

1872. ‘The manuscript of the ad-

from his son, A. EK. Chester of the
