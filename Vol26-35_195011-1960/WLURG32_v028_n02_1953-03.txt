Architect’s Tentative Drawing of Fine Arts Building

An

Washington and Lee is sud-
denly faced with a need for addi-
tional class-room space, a need that
must be described as critical.

Alumni may recall that there
has been no enlargement of our
instructional facilities in the last
seventeen years. From time to time,
new courses have been offered—
we think we have now a full and
balanced curriculum—but routine
arrangements were made.

A notable development of the
immediate past is the addition of an
ROTC. At its full scope, it will en-
list about three-fourths of our stu-
dents. The other boys have made
varying responses to the military
obligation that seems now to be a
part of every healthy boy’s plan-

ning. This excellent military unit

has not only sustained our enroll-
ment; it has given us a sense of ful-
filling the large mission of prepar-
ing our boys for service to our

country and our ideal, as they pre-
pare for careers of greatness.

Our ROTC includes a large vol-
ume of curricular study as sepa-
rate from mere exercises upon a
parade ground. When the unit is
in its full scope, it will comprehend,
we estimate, about twenty-four
sections, requiring seventy-two
class room hours each week.

Some other features of our ex-
panded program, for example, the
instruction in fine arts now widely
appreciated by our students, call
for a specialied type of class-room
facility. Mr. Morris Cafritz, father
of a recent graduate, has promised
$25,000 to meet this need.

It is not less than imperative that
we have another class-room build-
ing. At this moment we are liter-
ally using attics and basements,
and they are not enough. A picture
of the new building accompanies
this article. It will stand at the

Emergency Need

north end of the mall, matching
the McCormick library.

For the new structure we shall
need $300,000. A bit of quiet
requesting on the part of the T'rus-
tee committee for the building
(Trustees Chenery, Lykes, and Mc-
Donald) has brought us, in cash or
valid pledges, about $100,000.

We do not purpose any kind of
intensive solicitation of the general
alumni group. We recall how gra-
ciously that group responded to
the Bicentennial campaign just four
years ago; and we are mindful, as
I have said in another part of this
magazine, of the incalculable help
represented by the annual Alumni
Fund.

I am, however, announcing this
emergency that must be met. On
behalf of the University officials, I
invite aid from any alumnus, or
any other friend, who can help us
in this essential undertaking of
the University.

Puace hele hie.

New Plan To Attract Southern Students

Much of what is valuable in the
Washington and Lee tradition de-
rives from the fact that two-thirds
of its students come from the
South. Few would question that it
is desirable to preserve that tradi-
tion, and the Southern represen-
tation in the student body which
makes it possible.

In recent years the state institu-
tions, with their lower fees, have
attracted many Southern boys. As
population and high school atten-
dance have increased, many South-
ern students know of Washington
and Lee only as one of many com-
peting institutions, not as a college
which makes its unique contribu-
tion.

The spread of attendance geo-
graphically and other difficulties
make it impossible to present
Washington and Lee as effectively
as we should like at the College
Days in the high school themselves.
A plan was consequently devised
this fall whereby there would be
direct contact with promising stu-
dents in at least some of the South-
ern centers.

The first week in December
Dean Frank J. Gilliam made visits
to Charlotte, North Carolina;
Greenville, South Carolina; At-
lanta, Georgia; and Birmingham,
Alabama; on successive nights. In
each city a meeting was set up that
was definitely not an alumni meet-

By J. FRANK GILLIAM

Dean of Students
and Director of Admissions

 

ing as such. A small nucleus of
alumni formed a steering commit-
tee, and this group secured a list
of from ten to fifteen high school
seniors who would be regarded as
excellent prospects for Washington
and Lee if they decided to make
application. Suggestions for the
guest list came from alumni and
their families; high school student
advisers; and boys from the area
currently attending Washington
and Lee. In order that the boys
would receive the main focus of
attention, no more alumni attended
the dinner than one alumnus to
each boy, in some instances a smal-
ler proportion of alumni.

After the dinner Dean Gilliam
made a_ thirty-minute talk on
Washington and Lee, directing the
talk to the boys and not to the
alumni. The Bicentennial movie
was then shown.

The alumni attending in the dif-
ferent cities were as follows:

Charlotte: Herbert Woodward,
"4.1, Philip Howerton, ’25, George
Wilkinson, 26, Jack Crist, Jr.,
"4.5; Greenville: Steve Stephenson,
"40, Frank Morris, ’25, Bill Steph-
enson, 749, Brad Dunson, 742,
Andy White, ’39; Atlanta: Hal

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Clarke, ’38, Red Schneider, ’24,
Tommy Schneider, ’49, Alex Hitz,
Jr., 42, Frank Carter, ’49, Rodney

Ed Aull, ’23, Bestor Brown, 730,
Jim Hendrix, ’26, Howard Leake,
’24., Raleigh Jenkins, ’24, Bill Rat-
liff, ’47, Roy Hoffman, *50, and
Bill Latture, °4.9.

It is too early to evaluate the
plan in terms of applications from
the boys who attended the dinners,
but the general reaction to the idea
has been enthusiastic, and the plan
will undoubtedly be tried out in
other cities.

After the account of the visit
to the four cities named above had
gone to press, dinner meetings
were held on successive nights
from January 12 to 15, at Mont-
gomery, Mobile, Pensacola, and
Jacksonville.

At Montgomery Philip Sellers,
4.3, was in charge, with the fol-
lowing alumni sponsoring the din-
ner: Fred Bear, ’24, Carl Bear, ’33,
Russell Carter, ’35, Withers Davis,
"4.7, Bert Evans, ’33, Jack Hobbie,
°35, Charlie Hubbard, °48, T. B.
Hubbard, ’06, Luther McKinnon,

At Mobile, arrangements were
headed by John Ladd, ’32, with the
following as sponsors: Robert Ba-

Placement Service Helps Graduates

 

Frank McCormick (left) and John Williamson, ’53, being interviewed by Mr.
R. B. Pearsons of the Personnel Staff of Proctor and Gamble on December 9, 1952.

Need a job? Are you coming out
of the service and in need of help
in obtaining a position? Do you
wish to change positions? Do you
need information, help of any sort
pertaining to firms and_ possible
positions?

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity Counseling and Placement
Service is attempting to extend its
scope to include the alumni of the
University. Operating as a clearing
agency between business firms
which desire college trained per-
sonnel and Washington and Lee
graduates, both experienced and in-
experienced, the service attempts to
aid both parties.

The Placement Bureau will rec-
ommend qualified graduates to
business firms who send requests to
the University for personnel, and
also inform business firms on the
availability of properly qualified
graduates who desire employment.

Founded in February 1947 un-
der the direction of Psychology
Professor William M. Hinton, ’29,
the department has steadily in-
creased in size and capacity to
help. James D. Farrar, ’49, As-
sistant Dean of Students, has re-

4

cently replaced Dr. Hinton as de-
partment head. The service has
been partially sustained by funds
ear-marked for its purpose by
alumni contributing to the Univer-
sity.

The opportunity to assist alumni
desirous of obtaining positions is a
result of the tremendous influx of
firms to college campuses looking
for trained graduates. Experts say
the demand is higher now than it
has been at any time since World
War II. The firms are finding that
most of the graduates are going di-
rectly into the service, and as a re-
sult the alumni files are being used
more extensively than ever before.

To maintain its function the
placement service yearly sends
statements to about 300 firms con-
cerning the number of prospective
graduates of the University and
their respective fields of interest.
Those who reply or who otherwise
signify real interest are sent Uni-
versity catalogues.

Such firms as Armstrong Cork,
Berkshire Life Insurance Com-
pany, Brown and Williamson To-
bacco Corporation, Chase National
Bank of New York, Dan River

By J. W. BENJAMIN, JR., 754

 

Mills, Eastman Kodak, Conneticut
General Life Insurance, Gulf Oil
Corporation, Industrial Rayon
Corp., Kopper’s Company, Inc.,
and many others have been inter-
ested in Washington and Lee grad-
uates in the last few years. The
service maintains a large file of
business firms who are interested
in college graduates. Information
on chances for advancement, meth-
ods of operation, nature of pro-
ducts, etc., are available from the
file.

Similarly, the office maintains a
comprehensive filing list of gradu-
ates which includes interests, abil-
ities, personal information, etc.
Those alumni who have graduated
since the inauguration of the place-
ment service and made application
to that office while in school will
still have that information on file.

During the year the placement
service receives requests by letter,
telephone, or personal visit from
employers for recommendations of
graduates for specific positions. In
such cases the placement director
selects the graduates from the
placement registration records on
the basis of their qualifications and
experience, recommends to the em-
ployer, and arranges for personal
interviews.

However, the graduate must
complete the final step in the em-
ployment procedure by convinc-
ing the prospective employer that
he has the necessary qualifications
and interest to be of sufficient ser-
vice to the employer to warrant
his being on the payroll.

The firms represented are essen-
tially sales personnel, looking for
people to be trained for particular
positions. The office works side by
side with the other departments in
school such as journalism, law and

Have You "Seen” Our Publicity?

There’s a saying around the
campus that if you don’t know
what to do with him, just send him
over to the News Bureau.

That’s the principal reason why
so many visiting newspaper and
radio people, calendar and novelty
agents, Yankees looking for Con-
federate flags, and lovely old ladies
hoping for a conducted tour of the
grounds usually end up at our pris-
tine quarters in old Reid Hall.

Despite this constant flow of
interruptions, the News Bureau
manages to grind out an amazing
quantity of news releases from its
favorite antique mimeograph ma-
chine. (It works, doesn’t it?) After
all, our sole purpose in life is to
get a “good press” for Washing-
ton and Lee.

Sometimes this “good press” fix-
ation means working past 4 p.m.
when most of the administrative
personnel checks out for home and
old Southern comfort. Most of the
faculty has disappeared, too, and
the students, if not drilling with
the ROTC, have joined the 4

o’clock show team.

Sometimes it means working all
night.

Take for instance a_ blustry
Spring dawn. The time is 5 a.m.
Thursday. A television camera
stands in the grassy circle outside
Doremus Gymnasium. Huddled
around the big box with legs are a
CBS cameraman, a producer, and
the director of the University News
Bureau in his thin, ragged coat.
Everyone had run out of cigarettes
long ago.

On Monday before, two dozen
newspaper and radio reporters had
descended on the campus to cover
the two-day Mock Republican Con-
vention. Up in New York, Ed Mur-
row dispatched a camera crew to
film the event for his Sunday after-
noon “See It Now” television show.
For two days, “Little Chicago”

By the NEws BuREAU

 

bustled with make-believe politi-
clans, campaign parades, and a
maze of telephone and radio lines.
A haze of cigar smoke hung over
the valley floor like a swirling fog.

Wednesday came—a half mil-
lion words and a hundred pictures
later. With Eisenhower nominated
and the reporters gone, eleven hun-
dred weary Minks began drifting
away for a “long weekend.” In New
York, Ed Murrow was viewing
rushes of the film, just in by plane
from Roanoke.

We can’t quote Murrow exactly.
But it must have gone something
like this: “Zounds, men, terrific!
Gotta make it the feature of my
Sunday production! Send the crew
back for background shots!”

At 6 p.m. Wednesday, Murrow
alerted the News Bureau by tele-
phone. “Call back the Convention
chairman, the roll clerk, the lad

who had nominated Eisenhower,
and other important figures! Hold
the decorations in the gym! Gotta
get closeups and background for
atmosphere!” |

The Bureau went to work. The
Convention chairman was found
after 34 telephone calls in Buena
Vista at the home of a man he
had met casually for the first time
only an hour before. The roll clerk
was in Maryland, driving to Con-
necticut to see his girl. Located
at the home of an uncle, he prom-
ised to drive back to Lexington
after CBS proposed flying him to
Connecticut and return after the
closeups were filmed.

Shortly after midnight, the cam-
era crew arrived. Thousand watt
lights blazed against the famous
colonnade while outside shots of
“smoke-filled” caucus rooms were
taken. Behind drawn shades in a
classroom, the News Bureau staff
puffed furiously on cigarettes and

cigars, casting shadows on the win-
dow shades for “atmosphere.”

At dawn, the group moved over
to the gym to catch an outside
“night” view of Convention Hall. A
janitor was aroused to turn on
the lights. As soon as the first rays
of the sun were strong enough to
outline the structure, the film was
exposed.

At 8:30, closeups of Convention
officials were filmed inside the gym.
Take after take was made as the
sound man tried to recapture the
acoustics of the original roll-call.
All the while, 300 goggle-eyed
ladies gathered for a District Home
Demonstration meeting graciously
postponed the opening of their ses-
sion.

At 10 a.m. the film was rushed
to Roanoke and put on a plane for
New York.

At 11 a.m. the vanguard of 700
high school youngsters from 13
Southern States arrived for the
23rd annual Southern Interscholas-
tic Press Association convention.

At noon, the News Bureau staff
retired for lunch.

Fortunately, every week isn’t
as nerve-wracking. Normally, the
work of the News Bureau falls in-
to two broad groups. The first con-
cerns outsiders asking for infor-
mation about the University. These
include newspaper and magazine
writers, agencies making regional
or nation-wide surveys, and high
school youngsters requesting bio-
graphies of Washington or Lee for
English themes.

The second category is routine
publicity work—the dissemination
of news about the University, the
faculty, and the students to news-
papers and magazines. Taking a
closer look we find:

1. News of University affairs—
such as registration, convocations,
public speakers, faculty promotions
and achievement, gifts, and new
courses.

2. News of Student Affairs—
such as dances, elections, and
sports (handled separately by the
Director of Sports Publicity).

6

3. Hometown News—This is the
least known but probably the most
important phase of the News Bu-
reau’s work. While stories about
honor rolls, dean’s lists, initiations,
and so on, are sent out as general
releases to regional newspapers,
individual stories are mailed to
Hometown newspapers. If Joe
Blow, as we like to call him, is
elected Vice-President of his class,
his Hometown newspaper gets a
story and, if possible, a picture.

The News Bureau operates on
the principle that all “news 1s lo-
cal news”; that mothers and fathers
and their friends are more inter-
ested in Joe than in general unt-
versity news. In the course of a
single year, close to one thousand
Hometown stories are mailed to
weekly and daily newspapers. This
kind of publicity wears out a lot of
typewriter ribbon. It’s the kind of
job that is never done.

One difficulty, however, is that
the Bureau seldom sees these home-
towners in print. Although editors
always beg for them, they usually
forget to send us a clipping. Alum-
ni could perform a real morale-
boosting service if they’d clip and
mail to us any Washington and
Lee item they come across.

 

Placement Service
(Continued from page 4)

history, but doesn’t do as much of
the actual placement. That 1s left
up to the individual departments.
However, those students or alumni
interested in those fields may con-
tact the placement service which
will then work with the particular

department concerned in placing

the interested individual.

Starting salaries for those aided
by the service average $300 a
month. They are essentially train-
ing salaries with a good chance for
advancement. One _ exceptionally
capable graduate received $450 per
month as a starting salary. Every
man who truly wanted to be helped
has been placed by the office.

Any alumnus wishing informa-

tion on job possibilities, or inter-
ested in changing positions, or
wishing to be put on record should
future possibilities present them-
selves, is invited to contact the
placement office by mail or person.
Dr. Hinton and Farrar repeat that
they are swamped with requests
from firms throughout the country
for information on Washington and
Lee alumni who would fit into their
various needs.

“It is our wish to fill all these
positions with our men,” Dr. Hin-
ton says, “but we need to know
what alumni are interested.”

Graduates may be certain that a
complete record of their qualifica-
tions may be given their employer.
Where aptitude tests and inter-
est inventories are desired a com-
plete battery is available for admin-
istering. Interviews for students
and alumni are often arranged on
the campus, and can be arranged in
the proper office of the interested
firm.

Alumni writing the office are
urged to give information on the
type of job they are seeking, the
particular organization with which
they wish to affiliate, the location
they desire, and the individual qual-
ifications. The placement office re-
minds all that they cannot be re-
sponsible for obtaining the job,
they merely act as a liaison. They
will, if desired, do the actual con-
tact work with the organiaztion,
but the final work is up to the
alumnus.

Alumni are also urged to help
future graduates and fellow class-
mates by informing the office of
possible firm openings and organ-
iations which might be interested
in Washington and Lee men.

(The office is located in New-
comb Hall 22. Office hours are
from 8:30 to 4:00 p.m., Monday
through Friday, and 8:30 to 1:00

A Message irom President Gaines

Once more I have the happy privilege of thanking thousands of alumni in
a general way—I wish I could make it more personal—for a generous and an

inspiring support.

The statistics of this statement will suggest to you that alumni have given
to us what is the rough equivalent of income for one year upon a million dol-
lars. It could not have been the same successful, happy institution without

this support.

In my own heart there is something written that is even more important.
It was recorded adequately by the author of the epistle to the Hebrews: “See-
ing that we are encompassed with so great a cloud of witnesses...... we run
with patience the race that is set before us.”

From Florida to California, from Maine to Louisiana, these witnesses, far
removed by geography but close to us in dedicated purpose, have sacrificed,
have shared with us their earnings in life, that the ancient, honorable endeavor

may continue.

They have joined themselves with George Washington and Robert E. Lee
in making the focus of their allegiance this college in the Valley, this prophecy
of tomorrow. Sitting in General Lee’s home to write these brief lines, I can
only pray that we sustain here an institution worthy of the great heritage of
long centuries, worthy of the sympathetic support of 1952.

Gratefully yours,

Pent, foes

To the Members of the Washington and Lee
University Alumni, Incorporated

 

It is a distinct honor to serve as your President,
and my appreciation of the honor is sincere.

This is a democratic organization. Each grad-
uate of the University and each former student who attended one full term or
semester and who honorably left the University is an active member. No dues
are required to qualify for or to maintain membership.

Its chief purpose in the language of its charter is “to keep the bond between
Washington and Lee University and her alumni close and continuous.” The
governing body is a board of seven trustees which has rather complete author-
ity. Two or three trustees are elected each year for three-year terms at the an-
nual meeting of the members during Finals week. You will note in this issue
information about the Nominating Committee which will report at the next
meeting of the members on June 4, 1953. I urge you to come to this meeting
if you conveniently can.

Cy Young and his staff and the class agents produced excellent results for
the Alumni Fund in 1952. Both the number of contributors and the total
amount received in any prior year were exceeded in 1952. Our active interest
in Washington and Lee can easily be shown by replying to our class agent’s
letter each spring and by sending a contribution to the Alumni Fund each year.
I hope that more of you will do this in 1953 than ever before. The University
needs your active interest and your support. After the budgeted expenses of this’
organization are met, the net amount of the contributions is turned over to
the University Board of Trustees to use for such purposes as they determine
best for the University.

May each one of you resolve to keep the bond between you and the Uni-
versity close and continuous. Take an active interest in this organization and
in your local alumni association where one is near you. Visit the campus when-
ever you can, and contribute what you conveniently can give each year to the

Alumni Fund.

President
Washington and Lee Alumni, Inc.

Yours sincerely,

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY ll

Report of the 1952 Alumni Fund

Our annual Alumni Fund is one
of the most significant elements in
Washington and Lee’s financial
operations. Each year the proceeds
of this Annual Giving program be-
come part of an expendable fund
used to meet the most urgent needs
in the discretion of the University
Trustees—and the Alumni Fund
has assumed the vital role of mak-
ing it possible for Washington and
Lee to maintain and improve her
standards of education

For the 20th consecutive year
the Alumni Fund has topped the
previous year’s record and broke
into “new high ground.” And, for
the first time (in 1952)), we have
gone beyond the 2,000-mark in the
number of contributors. This is
encouraging but represents only
20% of our list of approximately
11,000 alumni. Our percentage of
alumni participation is recogniz-
ably inadequate, especially when
we consider comparable schools
(Princeton, Bowdoin, Amherst,
Williams) average 50%-and-better
participation in Annual Giving.
And, further, when we consider
that in the past 20 years, 5,585
alumni have contributed to our
Fund at one time or another.

% * %

The Class Agent is the backbone
of the Alumni Fund, and its suc-
cess will always be in direct ratio
to his loyalty, ingenuity, and perse-

By Cy YOUNG

Alumni Secretary

 

verance. In an undertaking so vast
and participated in by so many it
it indeed difficult to single out ind1i-
vidual accomplishments but I

- would like to pay special tribute to

some of our Agents who estab-
lished new records.

Under the leadership of Donald
K. Crawford, ’33-L, 88% of the
Class responded. This is a new per-
centage high and has eclipsed all
other records. (Dare we imagine
what would happen of 80% of the
entire alumni list responded? When
20% in ’52 contributed almost
$45,000?)

Headed by Class Agent Paul
Murphy, 1914-A was again the
“Dollars” leader ($2,662.00), as
well as percentage leader among
the Academic classes. Charlie Gil-
more, ’39-A Agent, placed his Class
on top in contribution “Numbers,”
69.

Other special mention should go
to Earl Rose, ’16-L—68% of his
Class responded; and Lawton Cal-
houn, ’31-A, runner-up for “Dol-
lars” leader, ($2,549.00).

Without listing them all here,
there were 4.4 classes which broke
all previous records for money re-
ceived in a single year; and 21
classes had their best year in the
number of contributors.

We want to express our heart-
felt thanks to each of last year’s
86 Class Agents—as well as to all
who have served in this capacity in
the years before—for the unstinted
support given in our Alumni Fund
effort.

* * *

Thinking ahead now to the 1953
Fund, to begin in April, here are
some questions every alumnus
should ask himself:

1. Is my name on the roster of
contributors for 1952?

2. Will it surely be there this
year?

3. Was my contribution what it
should have been? Will my 1953
oift be thoughtfully made and pro-
portionate to my ability to give?

* + *

The Alumni Fund is filling a
crucial area in the University finan-
cial picture. It must continue to do
so if we want to preserve for our
sons, and their sons, all that 1s good
in Washington and Lee. Let us re-
member that it has been said that
we never stop paying for our edu-
cation—and that we never stop

using it, either!
* + +

During the month of April you
will be receiving your Class Agent’s
annual letter. His job is not an easy
one. I hope you will answer him
promptly.

49, Phi Beta Kappa, honorary

cial fraternity, died January 6,
1953, in a New York Hospital, of
complications following an opera-
tion. He lived at 56 E. 80th Street,
New York, New York.

After leaving school Mr. Sugrue
returned to his home in Nauga-
tuck, Conn., worked a year on the
staff of the The Naugatuck Daily
News, and then became a member
of the city staff of The New York
Herald Tribune. In the next three
years he also wrote magazine ar-
ticles, including a profile for The

New Yorker on Cardinal Hayes. ©

His work caught the eye of Sumner
Blossom, editor of The American
magazine and from 1934 to 1936
Mr. Sugrue was on the staff of
that magazine, contributing articles
from various parts of the United
States and from Europe, the Near
East, Cuba, Mexico and Hawaii.

In 1937 Mr. Sugrue was
stricken with a crippling disease,
the nature of which remained ob-
scure. He never walked again but
got about in a wheel chair. At this
time he became interested in the
phenomenal Edgar Cayce who, it
was said, could diagnose while in

a trance the ailments of persons
at great distances from him and
advise them as to the proper pro-
cedure. Mr. Cayce was instrumen-
tal in helping Mr. Sugrue to live
with his ailment. In 1943 he wrote
There Is a River: The Story of
Edgar Cayce. Mr. Cayce, the mys-
tical diagnostician, and Mr. Sugrue
had been neighbors at Virginia
Beach from 1939 to 1941. Mr.
Cayce died in 1945.

Limited to an hour a day at the
typewriter, Mr. Sugrue could
compose and edit in his mind 1,000
words of copy and then write it
within the time allotted. In quick
succession he wrote and published
Starling of the White House, in col-
laboration with Edmund William
Starling, Secret Service Agent, who
was for thirty years a member of
the permanent staff of the White
House, a book which told of the
vigil kept over five presidents. Fol-
lowing this he published We Call
it Music, in collaboration with Ed-
die Condon, a book on the develop-
ment and significance of jazz; an
autobiography, Stranger in the
Earth: the Story of a Search, cover-
ing his long period of hospitaliza-
tion. He went to Israel in his wheel
chair in 1949 to study the Jews
and the development of their home-
land, where he stayed for five
months and then wrote Watch for
the Morning, published in 1950.
In 1952 he published A Catholic
Speaks His Mind, a controversial
book which has received much pub-
licity. Mr. Sugrue, while saying
he was eager to have his church
take the lead in a unified religious
movement in the United States,
was of the opinion that it had been
somewhat limited in its views as
had also the Protestants and Jews.

Quoting from an editorial in the
New York Times, January 8, of
which he had been a staff mem-
ber—“Tom Sugrue leaves behind
him many books and many mem-
ories, but perhaps none so ever-

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

lasting as the story of a man to
whom tragedy and even disaster
were only a spur to greater achieve-
ment.”

Mr. Sugrue married Miss Mary
Margaret Ganey in 1935. Also sur-
viving are a daughter, Patricia, and
a brother Francis Sugrue, ’4.0, and
a sister, Mrs. Margaret Hall.

tures were established by the Board
of Trustees of the University, and
were Inaugurated by the Honorable
John W. Davis, who delivered the
initial series in 1949 as a part of
the Bicentennial Celebration of the
of the University, and the Centen-
nial Celebration of the School of
Law.

The 1953 Lectures will be de-
livered by the Honorable Joseph C.
Hutcheson, Jr., of Houston, Texas,
Chief of the United States Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Judicial

Circuit, on April 28 and 29. The
subject of Judge Hutcheson’s series
of three lectures will be: “Law and
Liberty Reconciled, the Principle
and Paradox of a Free Society—the
Spirit of Its Laws.”

While the Lectures are primar-
ily for the Law School, they are
attended by interested students and
faculty from the College, and all
of the Lectures have been on topics
of general interest to alumni and
friends of the school. It is hoped
that alumni will consider this a
worthwhile occasion on which to
visit the campus.

 

Revised ChemistryText
Written by Dr. Desha

The Chemistry of the Com-
pounds of Carbon. Lucius JUNIUS
DesuHa, Professor of Chemistry,
Washington and Lee University.
New Second Edition. McGraw-
Hill Book Company, New York,
1952. 595 pages. Price $6.50.

The field of organic chemistry,
as its name indicates, had its origin
in the study of substances sup-
posedly derived from life processes.
When this artificial distinction was
broken down about a century ago,
the demonstration that many of the
products and constituents of living
organisms could be duplicated in
the chemical laboratory led the or-
ganic chemist to a field day in the
art of organic synthesis of the
compounds of carbon. Today the
volumes of Beilstein that merely
list these compounds with the min-
imum of properties necessary for
their identification number more
than 65, occupy many feet of li-
brary shelves, and describe briefly
more than half a million com-
pounds.

To make a logical selection from
this vast array of material that
would be suitable to introduce the
subject to the student in a one-year
course of organic chemistry is no
mean task. The skill with which
this has been accomplished by Prof.
Desha will bear some closer an-
alysis from the didactic point of

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

view. The principles which guided
Prof. Desha were several, ade-
quately comprehensive. He sought
an order of presentation that would
not only be logical in developing
the subject at hand, but would at
the same time lead the student to
an insight into the basic principles
of scienec and of general chemis-
try. The clarity with which the
author has accomplished this is
aided in no small degree by the
excellence of the figures and draw-
ings in which the text abounds.

Interspersed with the develop-
ment of the structure and character
of organic compounds are chapters
on their application in technology
and therapy. For example, the
chapters on the chemistry of the
hydrocarbons are followed by one
on the products of petroleum and
coal giving their properties, abun-
dance and numerous applications.
A chapter on color, dyes and dyeing
is introduced in appropriate se-
quence with explanation of the
physical and chemical concepts in-
volved.

A chapter entitled “Organic
Chemistry and Life” suitably treats
such subjects of perennial interest
as food, enzymes, fermentation, vi-
tamins, and introduces the modern
newcomers, hormones and _anti-
biotics.

In this thoroughly and soundly
revised Second Edition, the author
has amply demonstrated that in the
intervening sixteen years since the
appearance of the First Edition, he
has kept abreast of the remarkable
developments in theory, technique
and application of organic chemis-
try. His years of experience have
enabled him to develop and apply
a stimulating philosophy in his
teaching, reflected in the present
text which crowns his efforts in
the field to which he has devoted
himself. He is not content to pre-
sent bare facts, but relates them to
the underlying causes and reasons
in an interlocking framework of
theory and observation. This meth-
od not only enlists the student’s de-
sire but gives him a mnemonic sys-

23

 

tem into which new facts and re-
lationships can be readily intro-
duced and retained.

Of course the use of this text
book will be extended far beyond
the lecture halls of Washington
and Lee. The students of many
other institutions will supplement
their first lectures in organic chem-
istry through perusal of its pages
and will profit from the excellence
of its style and the clarity of its
logical presentation. As an alumnus
of Washington and Lee and for-
mer student of that master of in-
organic chemistry, James Lewis
Howe, I hope it is not inappro-
priate for me to congratulate the
students of Washington and Lee
on their association with Prof. De-
sha and the opportunity to sit un-
der his inspiring tutelage.

From this review I should not
omit an apology. It has been a
pleasure to read Prof. Desha’s text,
to review my inadequate know-
ledge of organic chemistry and to
learn some of the newer facts un-
known to me as a physical chem-
ist. Doubtless appreciation of Prof.
Desha’s accomplishment could and
will be better expressed in other
publications by more informed col-
leagues. To me, an outsider, or-
ganic chemistry appears as a great
tidal wave of science which extends
its powerful influence to many
fields of human interest and en-
deavor. Its vastness is stupendous,
its new creations have no limits.
For the organic chemist is also an
architect and builder. If a com-
pound in its existing form does not
fit a given need, medical or tech-
nological, he adds or removes com-
ponents until the right structure is
found. Merely the volume of his
productivity at times threatens to
flood the chemical literature. To
bridle this force, to keep it within
bounds of human comprehension
and of useful application is primar-
ily the responsibility of its teachers
and their texts. Prof. Desha’s Or-
ganic Chemistry will be a stalwart
pillar of that undertaking.

With Bell Telephone

Jim Lowry, B.S. 729, in Civil
Engineering has had nineteen years
of experience in the Engineering
Department of the Bell Telephone
Company in the Western Area. He
started as an engineering assistant
in the Buildings Section, working
on planning and designing of Tele-
phone Company buildings. His ser-
vice with the Company was inter-
rupted by World War II, from
1942 to 194.5. He served his coun-
try with great distinction in the

United States Naval Civil Engi-
neering Corps, generally known as
the “Sea Bees.” While in the sery-
ice, he was given command of a
company in a Construction Battal-
ion, during which period he led a
reconnaisance in force on an enemy
held island in the Pacific. The com-
pletion of this mission, in the face of
an attack by a Japanese patrol and
return to their ship through heavy
seas, won for Jim the Silver Star
Medal and the Navy’s commenda-
tion. He spent approximately
twenty months in the South Pacific
Area and later attained the rank of
Lieutenant Commander.

Jim returned to the Bell Tele-
phone Company late in 1945 and in
1947 was promoted to Senior Staff
Engineer handling building inspec-
tion matters for the Company. In
this connection he has had many
contacts with architects and con-
tractors who have a high opinion
of his knowledge and integrity.

In 1952, he was promoted to a
higher level of management with
the title of Buildings Engineer.

While at Washington and Lee
Jim was a member of Sigma Nu,
played Varsity basketball, ’26, °27

of six months. He was born in
Lexington, Virginia, October 8,
1900, in the home of his great
grandfather, Col. Samuel Mc-
Dowell Reid, which continued to
be his home until his death. His
erandfather was James Jones
White, professor of Greek at
Washington and Lee, 1852-1894,
and his father, Dr. Reid White,
Sr., ’87, was university physician
for many years. Dr. White’s roots
went deep into the history and
tradition of Rockbridge County
and Washington and Lee Univer-
sity, leaving Lexington only for
his medical training and war ser-
vice.

After attending the Lexington

graduating in 1919. After work-
ing for several years, he matricu-

1926. He continued his internship
in Philadelphia at the Pennsylva-
nia Hospital, and in 1928 returned
to Lexington to engage in the prac-
tice of medicine with his father.

ber 29, 1931, he practiced alone.

Dr. White became Washington
and Lee University physician in
1932, and continued as such until
ill health forced his retirement
last summer. Although he devoted
more and more time to his medical
work at college, he continued to do
a general practice among: his many
patients in Lexington and Rock-
bridge County.

His work at the University was
interrupted for the duration of
World War II. Almost immedi-
ately after Pearl Harbor he volun-
teered for service and was commis-
sioned a Captain in the Medical
Corps and went overseas to the
South Pacific with the 52nd Evacu-

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

ation Hospital Unit, participating
in the New Guinea Campaign,
where he served from January
1942 to December 1944. From
that time until he was separated
from the service with rank of lieu-
tenant-colonel in 1946, he was at
Camp Lee. He was a member of
the Washington and Lee Alumni
Association board of trustees for
several years and for a time its
treasurer. He took great interest
in the manifold activities of both
students and faculty at the uni-
versity. In addition to his busy
practice he took time to give his
attention and support to many insti-
tutions in Lexington.

Dr. White was married August
28, 1930, to Miss Alice Martin
Miller of Montclair, New Jersey,
who survives him with two chil-
dren, Miss Edith Canning White,
a student at Smith College, and
