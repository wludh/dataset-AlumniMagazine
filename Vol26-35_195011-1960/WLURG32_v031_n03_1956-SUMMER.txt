Freshman Camp to “College Friendships”

T WAS A BUSY YEAR. As always
I the students studied hard and
played hard. They argued over the
parking situation, and The Ring-
tum Phi editorialized at length
about the need for a Commons, the
football games, the Interfraternity
Council, and rejuvenating the
“speaking tradition.” Fads included
motor bikes and dark shirts. ‘The
freshmen came early in Septem-
ber, learned to know each other
at camp at Natural Bridge, and
together returned to the campus to
face the awesome world of “college”
and to be engulfed by fraternity
rushing. Upperclassmen struggled

and pursued knowledge, wrote
papers, endured labs on hot spring
afternoons, invaded the library in
droves before exams. Cane-twirling
law students argued minutely in
their chairs outside Tucker Hall.
Seminars, term papers, lectures
brought new learning and an at-
mosphere of intellectual endeavor.

Apart from classes, books, and
the library, there was much to fill
the already busy days. In the Col-
lege Quiz Bowl, Washington and
Lee’s panel had two victorious
evenings at the expense of Ford-
ham and Northwestern, before
meeting defeat at the hands of a

combined team from Hobart and
William Smith Colleges. Prize
money of $1,000 was used for re-
cords in the Anderson Music Room
and other extra-curricular items.
Fraternities carried on with high
spirit. But it was the last year for
their customary hazing practices.
Action by the Board of ‘Trustees,
the faculty, and the Interfraternity
Council ruled out harmful hazing,
although harmless initiation stunts
can be continued. In the fall, the
ZBT’s contributed most generously
to Campus Chest and earned the
services of three distinguished
waiters: Deans Leyburn and Gil-

liam and Treasurer Mattingly. Phi
Epsilon Pi Fraternity broke ground
for its new house (opposite the
Lambda Chi Alpha house) and
voiced the hope it will be com-
pleted in time for rushing parties
in the fall. In a sudden pre-election
switch, Delta Upsilon changed the
balance of power by withdrawing
its support from the Independent
Party, thus enabling the University
Party to capture six out of seven
major campus offices.
The ‘Troubadours

boring campuses, and a_ faculty
song-and-dance routine, was _ pro-
duced by the Student War Me-
morial Scholarship Fund Commit-
tee. Proceeds from the sell-out per-
formances went toward the second
$10,000 SWMSF goal.

Almost every week there was a
concert or lecture. ‘The Concert
Guild presented Menotti’s Christ-
mas opera, Amahl and the Night
Visitors, featuring student singers
and visiting artists. Other perform-
ers on the Guild Series included

 

 

 

University Dean James G. Leyburn
at the piano, and senior Frank R.
Ahlgren, Jr., of Memphis in a pro-
gram of folk singing. The Glee
Club and University Band _pre-
sented formal concerts, and other
musical groups—the Sazeracs, the
Southern Collegians, ‘The Blue
‘Lops—were in frequent demand.

‘Then there were the dances—
Openings in Neptune’s Elysium,
Fancy Dress in the Land of Oz;
Spring Dances a Fiesta occasion

The year brought many visitors to the campus, among them 15 Robert E. Lee Scholarship candidates, and 478 Parents’ Day guests...

one of the conspirators against
Hitler, public relations experts, a
representative of the Danish infor-
mation service, ministers, politi-
cians, lawyers, newspaper editors, a
news analyst, and a cartoonist. ‘The
English department held a series
of “Seminars in Literature’ and the
chemistry department had weekly
seminars led by members of the de-
partment and advanced students.
The spring ‘Tucker Lectures
brought to the campus William 'T.
Gossett, vice-president and general
counsel of the Ford Motor Com-
pany, who spoke on the responsibil-
ity of the large corporation in
American society.

‘The year brought many other vis-
itors. Nine hundred Southern Inter-

... Alumni Fund Agents to map their strategy, and Parents’ Advisory Council members to discuss parent-University relationships.

scholastic Press Association dele-
gates and their advisors descended
upon the campus in May for their
annual convention. The Virginia
Industrial Management Conference
brought industrial leaders from all
parts of the state to the University
for discussions and lectures. In the
fall, 409 parents of students came
to the University’s first Parents’
Day, to get acquainted with the
college and with members of the
faculty and administration. ‘The

 

Parents’ Advisory Council met at
the University twice. Alumni class
and regional agents came together
to plan their campaigns for a larger
Alumni Fund. In May, the Classes
of 1906 and 1931 held enthusiastic
50th and 25th reunions. Prospec-
tive students and their parents
came all through the year, as did
10,000 Or more tourists and visitors
to the Lee Chapel. And candidates
for Robert E. Lee Scholarships were
invited to Lexington in the spring
for personal interviews.

It was a year of high academic
achievement. Fourteen undergrad-
uates and two law students were
selected for Phi Beta Kappa; Beta

Gamma Sigma chose four seniors;
and the Order of the Coif named
three law students. At Commence-
ment, two men graduated summa
cum laude, fifteen magna cum

In athletics, the year was one of
disappointing team scores. but
notable individual achievements.
Gibby McSpadden, who ended his
college wrestling career with 39
victories and only two defeats and
who won three Southern Confer-
ence championships, was awarded
the trophy as the school’s outstand-
ing athlete of the year. Jay Fox
twice set pool records in the breast-
stroke; Alex Platt established a new
school standard in the shot-put; and
Dom Flora’s two-year 1,160-point-
total fell just short of an all-time
major college record for a basket-
ball player’s first two years of inter-
collegiate competition.

For the University as a whole,
the year was one of improved re-
sources and encouraging support.
An anonymous donor gave $250,000
to establish the Robert E. Lee
Scholarships, the first of which al-
ready have been awarded to young
men who will enter as freshmen
next year. This and other gifts
will enable the Scholarship Com-
mittee to award more than $90,000
to deserving students in the years
ahead. In 1953, the comparable
sum was $39,000.

In September, 1955, all Universi-
ty personnel received a five per cent
increase in salary. At the final facul-
ty meeting in June of this year
Dr. Gaines announced that another
increase would become effective
next September; full professors and
deans will receive an increase of
approximately ten per cent, all
other personnel five per cent. ‘This
salary increase was made possible
by a combination of gratifying gifts.

As this issue goes to press, for
example, the record-breaking Alum-
ni Fund has reached $100,000, with
3365 alumni recorded as contribu-
tors. Parents have _ contributed

During the year University of-
ficials gave careful thought to the
future. A new upperclass dormi-
tory and Commons, long urged by
faculty and student leaders, was
approved by the Board of ‘Trustees.
This building is scheduled to be
completed during the = 1957-58
session. The Board authorized the
appointment of a University archi-
tect to appraise the current physical
plant and draw up a master plan
for future campus development,
and also directed that a study be
made of all factors bearing on the
future size of the University.

T WAS A BUSY YEAR, culminating
I in Finals Week—dances, the
Alumni luncheon, board meetings,
Baccalaureate, and finally Com-
mencement. Under a hot cloudless
sky, students and faculty lined up
for the processional and parents
proudly watched their boys receive
their coveted diplomas. Within a
few hours after the singing of “Col-
lege Friendships,” the campus was
deserted. For the next two months,
few offices other than those of the
administration will see much activi-
ty. But almost before anyone can
realize it, September 19 will have
arrived, and with it the beginning
of the 208th session of Washington
and Lee. And believe it or not, we
will be looking forward to it.

“VHE UNIVERSITY CLOSED the 1955-
56 academic year on June 8 in
ceremonies highlighted by the
awarding of 181 undergraduate and
law degrees to seniors and four
honorary degrees to a former Uni-
versity Dean, two alumni, and a
distinguished Virginia educator.

Perfect June weather greeted the
hundreds of parents, relatives,
friends and alumni who attended
the Finals events. Challenging ad-
dresses by the presidents of two
Universities—Dr. Willis M. ‘Tate
of Southern Methodist University
and Washington and Lee’s Dr.
Gaines—were heard by the Bacca-
laureate and Commencement au-

diences, while the alumni luncheon,
the President’s reception, and the
Finals Dances, contributed to the
social flavor of the two-day program.

Completing the packed agenda
of Finals activities were meetings
of the University and Alumni
boards of trustees, the commission-
ing of 60 seniors in reserve compon-
ents of the Armed Forces, and the
general alumni session.

In his traditional commencement
remarks, Dr. Gaines urged the grad-
uates to see life’s “‘tip-toe mom-
ents of delight’”” which come when
one has attained the summit of
achievement and happiness. But he
warned that the fullest measure of

 

A familiar campus scene during Finals

material success is often not the
source of man’s ecstasies, and he
cautioned against escapism as a
shortcut to the happy life.

More than 2,000 persons heard
Dr. Gaines speak and looked on
as he conferred degrees upon 23
Bachelors of Law, 28 Bachelors of
Science in Commerce, 25 Bachelors
of Science, one Bachelor of Science
in Chemistry, and 104 Bachelors
of Arts.

‘Two students, law senior Beverly
Gray Stephenson of Wakefield, Vir-
ginia, and philosophy major Clay
Bryan Carr, of Winchester, Vir-
ginia, received their degrees swmma
cum laude. Sidmon Joel Kaplan, an

Amateur photographers—proud parents, relatives and _ friends—all set for the approaching academic procession at Commencement.

 

SUMMER 1956

 

 

 

 

 

Before an audience of more than 2,000 people, PRESIDENT GAINES conferred honorary degrees upon a former University Dean, Dr.

ROBERT ‘TUCKER; a Virginia educator, DR. MABEL WHITESIDE; and two alumni, Dr. WiLey Davis Forsus, 16, and JoHN WILSON DryE, ’20.

A. B. graduate from Miami Beach,
Florida, was announced the winner
of the Algernon Sydney Sullivan
Medallion for excelling “in high
ideals of living, in spiritual quali-
ties, and in generous and disinter-
ested service to others.”

The honorary degree of Doctor
of Laws was conferred upon former
Dean Robert Henry ‘Tucker, a
member of the Washington and
Lee family from 1915 until his re-
tirement in 1948. In reading Dr.
Tucker’s citation, Dean James G.
Leyburn declared:

“His retirement has simply in-
creased his range of service, for
he now advises the Commonwealth
on matters of transportation, and
he has counseled it in the past on
taxation, local government, and
reorganization. Economist, adminis-
trator, scholar, and gentleman, his
gracious generosity of spirit make
him beloved by every Washington
and Lee man who has known him.”

Others receiving honorary de-
grees were alumni John Wilson
Drye, ‘20, New York attorney, and
Dr. Wiley Davis Forbus, ’16, profes-
sor of pathology at Duke Univer-
sity, and Dr. Mable Kate White-
side, professor emeritus of Greek at
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College.

Of ‘Texas-native Drye, who re-
ceived the degree of Doctor of Laws,
Dean Leyburn’s citation said:

“With truly Texan magnificence,
he has shown himself at home on
the range of legal problems, and
has, as director, ridden herd on
many great corporations. He is a
past president of the Washington

10

and Lee Alumni Board of Trustees,
an ornament to the legal profession,
and a wise and generous counselor
to all who know him.”

The Doctor of Science citation
for Dr. Forbus stated:

“His teaching, research, and pub-
lications are notable. He has been
consultant to many hospitals and
governmental bodies on pathology,
and to the Secretary of War on in-
fectious and epidemic diseases. His
alma mater is grateful for his
achievements in the conquest of
disease.”’

Dr. Whiteside, the second woman
to receive an honorary degree from
the University, was made Doctor
of Letters. Her citation included:

“She has inspired students for
fifty years with a love of classical
learning. In all she does, she follows
the Greek ideal of arete, excellence
in all that is admirable.”

The honorary awards were the
first Washington and Lee has made
since 1954.

For the Baccalaureate service,
Washington and Lee had as its
speaker one of the outstanding
young college presidents in Amer-
ica. Dr. ‘Tate, a former star foot-
ball player and a prominent lay
leader in the Methodist Church
and the National Council of
Churches, became the fifth presi-
dent of Southern Methodist in
1954. He is now 45.

In his address to the seniors, he
implored them “to become some-
thing more than little empty bottles
filled from the master jug of a
college education.” He said a col-

lege diploma should represent a
receipt for the weapons and tools
with which Washington and Lee
has equipped them for facing life.

Dr. ‘Tate cited independence of
thought and action, capacity for
tension, willingness to accept re-
sponsibility and universal values as
“indispensable tools’ for getting
along in the world today.

Following Dr. ‘Tate’s address,
more than 625 seniors, parents,
faculty, and alumni were the guests’
of the Alumni Association at the
annual luncheon on the back cam-
pus lawn. That night, the Presi-
dent’s reception for seniors and
their guests was attended by ap-
proximately 1,500 persons.

On the student social side, the
Finals Dance set included the mu-

of the Class of 1956 who had com-
pleted four years of campus and
summer training were commission-
ed by Lt. Colonel Charles E. Coates,
Jr., professor of Military Science
and ‘Tactics.

Three seniors were made second
lieutenants in the Marine Corps
Reserve, and one student was made
a regular Marine officer. Major
Adolphus G. Schwenk, Marine pro-
curement officer of Washington,
D.C. presented the commissions.
The new officers had taken part
during the summer vacations in the
Marines’ officer candidate and pla-
toon leaders school at Quantico.

Five officer candidates in the
Naval Reserve program were com-
missioned as ensigns by Captain J.
B. Azer, director of reserve training
for the Fifth Naval District. ‘hese
students had attended the Navy’s
officer candidate school at Newport,
Rhode Island, for two summers.

All new officers have begun or
will begin in the near future active
duty tours. Army personnel will
serve for either six months or two
years on active duty, while the Ma-
rine and Navy personnel will draw
assignments up to three years.

Seven additional R.O.T.C. grad-
uates will be commissioned at
Fort George G. Meade, Maryland,
following the completion of sum-
mer training there. In all, 62 Wash-
ington and Lee cadets are among
the more than 1,500 college men
undergoing training there. Three
officers and five enlisted men of the
University’s training staff are on
duty at Fort Meade for the eight-
week period.

Friend and teacher of Washington
and Lee Students 1920-1956... Pro-

the Department 1938-1956,” will be
placed on a new English seminar
room in tribute to the veteran pro-
fessor who retired in June after
completing 36 years at Washington
and Lee. Plans for the establish-
ment of a room in his name were
revealed to Dr. Moffatt for the first
time by his departmental colleagues
at a dinner held on June 4.

The University and hundreds of
Dr. Moffatt’s former students have
provided funds for the room, which
will contain seminar tables, com-
fortable chairs, curtains, and built-
in bookcases for a special reference
library in English and American lit-
erature. The books are the contri-
bution of Dr. Moffatt’s depart-
mental colleagues.

A gift of the department, a silver
tray inscribed with a quotation
from the epic Anglo-Saxon poem,
“Beowulf,” also was presented to
Dr. Moffatt, whose course in Anglo-
Saxon literature has been one of
the few offered in this field by an
American undergraduate college.

Dr. Moffatt also received the
many letters of tribute from his
former students which accom-
panied contributions for the new
seminar room.

Just before his retirement, Dr.
Moffatt had been honored at the

annual sports outing by being
awarded a W&L monogram sweater
and a special certificate for his
loyalty to the Generals over his 36
years as a faculty member.

Dr. and Mrs. Moffatt are now re-
siding at their family home in Mt.
Chickasaw, South Carolina, where
Dr. Moffatt plans to continue his
study and shoot quail.

Ford Counsel Gives
19560 Tucker Lectures

‘HE ROLE OF TODAY’S corporation
lawyer and the complex problems
he faces were assayed by the general
counsel of one of America’s big-
gest corporations for the Eighth
Annual John Randolph ‘Tucker
lectures at Lee Chapel, May 11-12.

William T. Gossett, vice-presi-
dent and a member of the board of
directors of the Ford Motor Com-
pany centered his three-lecture
series on the theme of “Corporate
Citizenship and the Law.”

Addressing an audience of stu-
dents, law professors and visiting at-

12

torneys, Mr. Gossett opened his first
address, “The Role of the Law” on
a note of warning for big business
to deal fairly and justly with all
segments of society or face the pros-
pect of repressive legal restrictions.

“The age-old cry of ‘there ought
to be a law’ will always be heard
in America,’ Gossett declared. He
said corporations must find ways of
assuring fair treatment of all whose
lifeblood is intermingled with that
of the corporate being.

He cited the concept of the “cor-
porate conscience’ as a_ possible
means by which big business is be-
coming increasingly aware of its
responsibilities. Mr. Gossett added
that corporate structure has its
roots deep in American society, and
its potential for both good and
evil is tremendous.

Playing the leading role in the
development of ‘“‘corporate con-
science” is the corporation lawyer,
the Ford official said. In his second
and third addresses, ‘““Che Role of
the Corporate Conscience’ and
“Guides and Limitations,’ Mr. Gos-
sett outlined the qualifications for
this branch of legal practice, stress-
ing a need not only of knowledge
of law but of public opinion and
the forces which act upon it.

GOSSETT
Concept of “corporate conscience” cited

 

‘The corporation lawyer will be
alive to the social, economic and’
political implications of the time,
and he will avoid a narrow, short-
sighted approach to his corpora-
tion’s problems,’”’ he asserted. Fail-
ure to be aware of public sentiment
may see a legal battle won, but a
social war lost, Gossett added.

“The quality of his advice, his
real effectiveness, will be just as
good as the quality of his broad
judgment and the depth of his in-
sight into the world around him,”
Gossett said in summing up the
corporation lawyer.

The ‘Tucker Lectures, which
were established in 1949, honor the
second dean of Washington and
Lee’s School of Law. Dean ‘Tucker,
who served as president of the
American Bar association in 1892-
93, headed the law school from 1873
until 1896.

‘This year’s lecturer is a native
of ‘Texas and received his B.A. de-
gree at the University of Utah and
his LL.B. at Columbia. He joined
the Ford Motor Company in 1947
following a distinguished career
in other phases of corporate coun-
seling. He is 51 and lives in Bloom-
field Hills, Michigan.

 

Athletes Receiwe Awards
and Select Captains

FOR THE SECOND YEAR in a row,
participants in Washington and
Lee’s winter and spring sports pro-
grams enjoyed the hospitality of
Cap’n Dick Smith at the former

athletic director’s Rockbridge
County farm where the Athletic
Department staged its annual

awards barbeque. More than 150
athletes, coaches, faculty, athletic
committeemen and guests lined up
for the roast pork and trimmings,
served by the coaches’ wives.
Although a May thunderstorm

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

curtailed the individual monogram
presentations which followed the
barbeque, those attending braved
the rain while six athletes were ac-
corded special awards.

The man who received the big-
gest hand was not an athlete, how-
ever, but one of the most devoted
sports followers in the University’s
history. Retiring English professor
Dr. James Strong Moffatt, Jr., was
presented with a monogram sweater
and a special certificate.

‘The top student award went to
Gilbert R. “Gibby” McSpadden, of
Memphis, three-time Southern Con-
ference wrestling champion and a
track star, as the University’s out-
standing athlete. The trophy, pre-
sented each year by alumnus Pres
Brown, ’41, a former General foot-
baller, goes to the athlete who, in
the coaching staff’s opinion, has
brought most honor upon himself
and the school during the past year.
McSpadden climaxed a_ brilliant
wrestling career by winning the
177-pound championship in_ the
Southern Conference ‘Tournament,
held in Doremus Gymnasium
March 1-3, and then displayed
newly-discovered talents as a high
and low-hurdler for the Generals’
track team, winding up the season
as the squad’s second-highest 1956
point producer.

Besides the top athlete award,
McSpadden also received the Archie
Mathis Wrestling Trophy as the
outstanding mat performer during
the 1955-56 season.

Alex Platt, a junior from River-
side, Connecticut, received the For-
rest Fletcher Memorial ‘Trophy as
the outstanding competitor on the
1956 track and field squad. Platt
established a new school record in
the shot put this year, adding to
laurels won last season when he
erased the school’s previous stand-
ard for the discus.

Bob McHenry, diminutive vet-
eran guard on Coach Billy Mc-
Cann’s basketball team, was hon-
ored as the “most valuable player,”

in the Generals’ late-season recov-
ery of winning form. He received a
wristwatch, presented by Hamric
and Sheridan Jewelers as the first
award in this category which the
Lexington firm will make annually.

Big Six diving champion Charlie
Richardson, of Urbanna, Virginia,
was named the swimming team’s
outstanding performer. The stocky
junior was unbeaten in dual meet
competition, and missed the South-
ern Conference crown by only a
small margin.

Senior Carlos 'T’. Bailey, of Wash-
ington, D.C., received the Wheel-
right Memorial Lacrosse ‘Trophy as
the team’s star player, and sopho-
more John C. Croker, of Ruxton,
Maryland, was accorded a special
award in recognition of his out-
standing team spirit.

Participants in nine winter and
spring sports—basketball, wrestling,
swimming, track, baseball, lacrosse,
rifle, golf and tennis—were awarded
106 individual monograms.

Announced as captains and co-
captains for next year were: basket-
ball—Barry Storick, of Brooklyn,

and Lee Marshall, of Ashland,
Kentucky; wrestling—Dick White-
ford, of Baltimore, and Bob Miller,
of Charlottesville; swzmming—Lou

WASHINGTON AND LEE was host on
May 11-12 to 33 members of the
academic and law classes of 1931
and 20 members of the classes of
1906 for the second in a new annual
reunion series sponsored by Wash-
ington and Lee and the Alumni
Association.

It was the second year for the
25-year Convocation and Reunion,
but the return of the “old timers”
a half century after graduation
marked the inauguration of the
50-Year Convocation and Reunion.

For the most part, the two classes
took part jointly in the meetings
with University officials and pro-
fessors and in the full social pro-
eram, but class banquets and re-
ceptions permitted a measure of
merrymaking and reminiscing for
each group.

The Alumni President Reviews

Progress and Projects

JouNn F. HENDON, ’24

HIS MEETING MARKS the close of
1 my third year as a member of
your Board of ‘Trustees. ‘They have
been years of pleasant associations,
of interesting and challenging prob-
lems and projects. It has been a
period of my life when I have
gained a sense of personal satis-
faction which I could have received
in no other way than to have been
allowed this intimate association
with Washington and Lee—its
alumni, students, faculty and ad-
ministration. ‘To top it off in
greater honor, for the past year I
have been privileged to serve as
your president.

In addition to two regular meet-
ings this year in Lexington, your
board members have been in fre-
quent contact with the University,
either in person or by telephone.
Each member has made a real effort
to follow University proceedings
and alumni activities closely, so that
he might give a full measure of serv-
ice both to Washington and Lee
and to you who elected him.

‘The “task force” of the Alumni
Association, of course, is the Alum-
ni office staff, headed by our Execu-
tive Secretary, Cy Young. I have
nothing but the highest praise for
his devotion to our University and
for the energy and wisdom he con-
tinues to impart to the program
of the Association.

‘Though he has labored for years
with marked success and without
complaint, Cy Young nonetheless
has been in need of administrative
assistance. A special committee of

16

the Alumni Board with Howard
W. Dobbins, ’42, as_ chairman,
tackled this problem early this year
and in October recommended to
the Board the appointment of
James H. Price, Jr., ’41, as associate
alumni secretary. I am happy to
say that his nomination met with
the full approval of your Board and
of University officials, and he as-
sumed his duties at the beginning
of the calendar year. Much of the
success Of our various alumni ac-
tivities these last few months can be
credited to his resultful efforts.

Other members of the staff have
worked with equal diligence. But
the staff, and we, are faced with
another big problem. ‘The alumni
program with its many ramifica-
tions outgrew several years ago the

 

HENDON
Here are taught the unchanging values

space and facilities available for
its efficient operation. During the
past few years we have eased the
burden by providing much needed
new equipment to streamline the
mechanics of office procedures. In
fact, we have gone about as far as
we can in this direction. But the
space problem still remains. Your
Board is aware of it and has shared
its thoughts with University of-
ficials. We are hopeful that a satis-
factory solution can be found, and
that in the not too distant future.

Details of Alumni Office activi-
ties will be given you by Cy Young.
I wish to consider only a few in
this message.

First, I think you would be in-
terested to know that your Alumni
Board had a part in securing a new
dean for Washington and Lee. At
the request of University authori-
ties, we appointed a member of our
Board, Paul C. Buford, ’13, to
advise in securing a successor to Dr.
Leyburn when he resigned his po-
sition as dean. I am highly pleased
to report the appointment of Dr.
Leon Sensabaugh of Birmingham-
Southern to this position.

Second, I wish to report on the
Alumni building. A special commit-
tee with Martin P. Burks, III, ’32,
as chairman and members of the
Alumni Board and faculty repre-
sentatives has been studying this
project carefully. Several proposals
have been presented; several pos-
sibilities exist. At this stage in our
deliberations, however, there is no
definite answer to advance.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

The third item concerns the
Alumni Fund. And here I want to
pay sincere tribute to the members
of the Alumni Fund Council and to
its chairman, Paul C. Buford. These
men have seen the possibilities of
the Fund, and they have been in-
strumental in initiating new and
improved fund procedures. ‘This
year we have seen overwhelming
proof of the wisdom and effective-
ness of their labors. When the Fund
Council was established three years
ago its members saw the possibility
of doubling the Alumni Fund,
which then totaled $49,000.000
from 2,317 alumni. Cy Young has
reported today, and with several
important weeks ahead before the
close of the current campaign, these
figures may well be doubled.

To Washington and Lee this
means that faculty salaries can be
raised, an essential step if we are to
retain our very able teaching staff.
It means that our library can be
improved, book collections enlarged
and expanded. In a very real sense
this will be a stimulus to our whole
University, for in many respects
the library is the heart of the school.
Moreover, our growing Fund means
that other operational necessities
also can be met.

But an improved Alumni Fund
has still another important value
that cannot be overlooked. It relates
to our University Development Pro-
gram, begun in September, 1953.
‘To me, one of the red-letter days in
the progress of the University was
that on which the University chose
Don Smith to formulate and head
this Development Program. Don
has made a shining reality of pro-
posals and plans. I cannot speak too
highly of his ability and the job this
ability has already produced.

The Development Program an-
ticipates securing funds for the Uni-
versity’s current and _ foreseeable
needs from a variety of sources
other than alumni—from parents,
corporations, foundations, and

SUMMER 1956

friends of the University. None
of these groups is as closely asso-
ciated with Washington and Lee
as we, the alumni. They very fre-
quently ask, therefore: ‘“What are
your alumni doing to help?” The
stronger answer we, as alumni, can
give, the more easily we can con-
vince others that their support will
be well placed.

I believe that one of the reasons
our Alumni Fund and Development
Program are meeting with such suc-
cess is that we are all becoming in-
creasingly aware that the indepen-
dent college, particularly the small
private institution like Washington
and Lee, is one of the strongest
buttresses of our American way of
life today. In this type of college,
in my opinion, lies our springing
hope that this country will turn
rightward again and exemplify the
home of the free individual and not
the corral of regimented masses.

In this day of mass production,
mass entertainment, the promise
of expanded mass education, and
government by the masses, the indi-
vidual has all but gotten lost in the
shuffle. With the great emphasis on
technical training, we seem to for-
get what was once the prime ob-
jective of education—the training
of the thoughtful man.

Mr. Leroy A. Lincoln, Chairman
of the Board, Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company, speaking be-
fore a commencement audience at
the University of the South last
year said:

“...nowadays private enterprise
is dependent, in large measure,
upon private educational institu-
tions for executives, technicians,
methods, business philosophy and
for basic research. If business and
industry could not draw upon a
large reservoir of educated man-
power, they would be handicapped
in every phase of their operations.
One well-known businessman has
pleaded, ‘give us educated men. We
can train them ourselves. But we

cannot educate them.’ In the past
American education has done that
job; it has provided educated men
for private enterprise.”

Dr. Robert E. Wilson, Chairman
of the Board of the Standard Oil
Company of Indiana, said:

“A recent study of 33,500 busi-
ness executives shows that 88 per
cent had college backgrounds, and
significantly, that 71 per cent of
them came from privately sup-
ported colleges and universities. I
say ‘significantly’ because it has
been the independent, privately
supported schools that have chiefly
fostered the general or ‘liberal arts’
education in the past.”

Private education, in most cases,
is education in an atmosphere of
freedom. ‘The private college must
retain this atmosphere. It must be
free to resist all pressure groups,
particularly political _ pressure.
James Bryant Conant, as President
of Harvard, once said:

“The primary concern of Ameri-
can education today is not the
development of the appreciation of
the ‘good life’ in young gentlemen
born to the purple. Our purpose
is to cultivate...an appreciation
both of the responsibilities and the
benefits which come to them be-
cause they are American and free.”

Washington and Lee has this
atmosphere of enterprises and free-
dom which produces leaders. This
University trains men to think for
themselves and to act on those
thoughts. Men are taught to think
of themselves as responsible indi-
viduals and not to become a small
conforming part of mass indoctri-
nation. Here men are prepared to
be the leaders of the future, but are
given a sobering sense of continuing
by their actions a long and honor-
able past. Washington and Lee gives
a man more than he can learn from
books. Here men are taught those
unchanging values—the apprecia-
tion of courtesy, the respect for

Report from the Alumni Secretary Describes

A Notable Chapter

H. K. (Cy) Youne, ‘17

HROUGHOUT MY 27 YEARS Of re-
Posi aakine you have heard a
ereat deal about the activities of
your Alumni Association and of
plans for its future. In this brief
summary I am happy to remind you
that many of those plans, once in
the blueprint stage, are now a very
real part of our alumni structure.

We have a healthy, growing
Alumni Fund that is beginning to
compare favorably with similar
funds of other institutions like us in
size and caliber. I shall return to
this topic a little later.

We initiated this year a sort of
workshop for the Class Agents and
Regional Agents who are working
in behalf of the Alumni Fund. In
November we invited the Class
Agents to visit the campus to be-
come acquainted with the Wash-
ington and Lee of today; and in
March, Regional Agents assembled
on the campus for the same pur-
pose. We have 87 Regional Agents
doing personal solicitation work for
the Alumni Fund.-this year, and 91
Class Agents.

Our Class Reunion Program
seems established. The second an-
nual 25-year Class Reunion was
held here in May, and the 50-Year
Class was added to the plan. ‘The
entire group included 61 alumni
and about 50 wives. We believe
everybody had a good time. Inci-
dently, the Classes of ’31 (Academ-
ic and Law), celebrating their 25th
anniversary have made a total con-
tribution of $7,092.00 to the Alum-
ni Fund this year, designated as a
memorial to deceased classmates.

18

Definite steps are under way to-
ward acquiring an Alumni-Faculty
House. This project has been
studied and discussed by both the
University Board and the Alumni
Board, and we now feel this long-
needed facility will be realized
within the foreseeable future.

We are mailing The Alumni
Magazine and an _ ever-increasing
amount of informative literature
to ALL alumni on our list—55,000
pieces of mail went out from our
office in December alone— whereas
we formerly mailed the Magazine
to contributors only.

Much of all this progress is due
to the fact that we now have an
office that is equipped with some of
the best in time-saving and labor-
saving machines. ‘his year we have
added a Pitney-Bowes postage me-
ter machine and an automatic feed
for our addressograph machine, to
mention just two new items. We
could still use more files and equip-
ment if space permitted.

Now I come to what I personally
feel is the most progressive step
taken by the Alumni Board this
year, the appointment of James
Hubert Price, Jr., Class of ’41, as
Associate Alumni Secretary. Jim
came with us on January 1, and I
cannot praise his work highly
enough. I attribute much of the
success of this year’s Alumni Fund
to his untiring efforts. He has been
a true son of Washington and Lee
from the day he entered as a fresh-
man in 1937 and, through his fath-
er, even before that time. I ain de-
lighted to have Jim Price with me.

Thus we have seen many dreams
come true at Washington and Lee
this year.

Now to return briefly to the 1955-
56 Fund: When the Alumni Fund
Council met in September they
set a goal of $100,000 for this year’s
Fund. At the time I thought they
were entirely too optimistic; after
all, the jump from last year’s
$62,000 to a goal of $100,000 rep-
resented a 4o per cent boost. How-
ever, from results as of June 7, it
would appear that I was entirely
too pessimistic, since $88,289.65
from 2, 810 is already “in the till.”
These figures represent by far
the most money and the largest
number of contributors ever to
participate in our Fund. It is true
that we have not reached our goal
but we still have 23 more “Fund-
giving days’ until we close our
books on June 30, and past records
show that the month of June is —
usually the most productive.

And so I report to you that I am
tremendously encouraged. I am at
a loss to know how to thank so
many for doing so much.

The administration has cooper-
ated completely, and Dr. Gaines,
Dean Gilliam, Dean Leyburn, and
Mr. Mattingly have been generous
with their time and support.

Jim Price has been my right hand.

The ladies of the office staff have
been efficient, loyal and cheerful.

Don Smith’s vision with regard
to the University development pro-
gram has been an inspiration to all
of us, and his staff has worked hand-
in hand with the Alumni Office.

The Class Agents and the Reg-
ional Agents have been wonderful.

The Alumni Fund Council, and
especially its chairman Paul Bu-
ford, has guided us and had confi-
dence in us.

The Alumni Committee of the
Faculty and the Faculty Reunion
Committee have done marvelous
jobs for us.

Friend to Students, Faculty and Alumni

Miss Mary Retires

NE OF WASHINGTON AND LEE’'S

best friends—friend to students,
friend to faculty, friend to alumni—
has retired from active association
with its activities.

Miss Barclay, who celebrated her
seventy-fifth birthday in February,
stepped down from the alumni
office staff this spring. Her retire-
ment became effective March 1.

Long associated with Washington
and Lee and its traditions, Miss
Barclay — ‘‘Miss Mary,” as those
who knew her well called her—had
served the University for more than
forty years when she stepped aside.

During most of that period she
had been intimately involved with
all phases of alumni work, and her
retirement takes from the Wash-
ington and Lee scene one of its
most familiar, and one of its best
loved, figures.

“Miss Mary” is the descendant
of two former members of the Uni-
versity Board of ‘Trustees, and a
member of one of lLexington’s
oldest families. Her grandfather,
Colonel Alexander ‘T. Barclay,
served on the Board from 1835 to
1839. Her father, Alexander 'T. Bar-
clay was a member of the Board
from 1885 to 1915.

Born in Lexington, Miss Barclay
began her active part in University
affairs in 1913, when the late Paul
Penick, in whose law office she
had been secretary, was appointed
Washington and Lee treasurer.

She served as his secretary for
several years, and for a time was
secretary also to Dr. Henry Louis

SUMMER 1956

Smith during his presidency, and
then, during World War I, she in-
terrupted her career here to take
on war work in Washington. She
first took up her duties as a mem-
ber of the staff of the alumni of-
fice in 1919, when she returned
to Lexington.

For many years she was the only
office assistant to the Alumni Sec-
retary. At one time, before H. K.
(Cy) Young became Alumni Sec-
retary in 1929, she took charge of
all alumni office activities; and
again during Mr. Young’s absence
in World War II, from November,
1942, to September, 1944, she super-
vised alumni work.

All aspects of alumni work held

 

Miss Mary BARCLAY

A beloved figure steps aside

her interest, but her principal con-
cern for many years was the Alumni
Magazine, which she edited for
several issues during the 20's, and
for which she traditionally com-
piled class notes throughout her
career here.

Because of her alumni work, and
because, as she recently _ said,
“We've always had students living
here’ (referring to the Barclay
home on Lee Avenue), Miss Barclay
probably knows well as many alum-
ni as any person associated with
Washington and Lee. Many official
alumni letters have been personal-
ized by accompanying notes from
“Miss Mary.”

But time will not hang heavy
on her hands. For years her princi-
pal outside interest has been wood-
carving. ‘This interest, which began
as a hobby and in time developed
into a skill which brought Miss
Barclay widespread recognition,
will probably occupy much of her
time now. Completely self-taught,
she perfected a technique which
ultimately won her high praise and
numerous assignments. One of
them was a commission to carve
chests for presentation to Queen
Mother Elizabeth and to Mrs.
Franklin D. Roosevelt. Another
was Washington and Lee’s cere-
monial mace, which she carved in
three months in 1951 from a design
by Dr. Marion Junkin, ’27, head
of the Department of Fine Arts.
Other examples of her work adorn
many fraternity houses on_ the
Washington and Lee campus.

SECRETARY'S REPORT

(Continued from page 18)

The Alumni Board has given un-
told hours of time and thought to
University and alumni problems,
and no Alumni Association has
ever had a more devoted and ener-
getic president than John Hendon.
We are fortunate to have his coun-
sel for another year.

I know how dangerous it is to
make such a listing; I hope that
I have not left out too many per-
sons and groups. Certainly I want
to report to this assembly that we
lost, this Spring, the services of
one of our most loyal supporters
when Miss Mary Barclay retired
from our staff. She will be greatly
missed not only by those who had
the pleasure of working with her
but by the hundreds of alumni who
have known her over the years.

When the Alumni Fund Council
set a $100,000 goal for us in Sep-
tember, they set the pace for what
I believe has proved to be the busi.
est year in our Association’s 116-
year history. Through generous co-
operation the rewards of effort have
made the year a notable chapter
in that history.

PRESIDENT’S REPORT
(Continued from page 17)

truth, the cherishing of friendships,
and, above all, the love of honor.
No man can stay on this campus for
four years and not become imbued
with these principles and not feel
a real sense of responsibility to
uphold them all his life.

You know, if the success of a
college were measured like the suc-
cess of a business, by the number
of satisfied customers, then Wash-
ington and Lee would be one of the
most succesful ventures of all time,
for I truly believe that it would
be difficult to find a graduate of
this institution who does not feel
loyal, grateful, honored, and proud
to be an alumnus of this University.
