O STUDENTS STANDING in the long,
‘L stow-moving registration line at
Washington and Lee in September,
the size of the student body prob-
ably mattered little, except that in
their own immediate circumstances
it undoubtedly seemed much too
large. They may have read of the
tidal wave of students that is be-
ginning to cause the nation’s col-
leges to stir uneasily lest some be
threatened with inundation, but it
is doubtful that they had thought
very long on how Washington and
Lee would be affected. As far as
they could tell, the University had
always been its present size, and
from the looks of things it would
remain that way, for the faculty,
classrooms, and laboratories ap-
peared to be taking care of just
about as many students as they
comfortably could.

But the impending tidal wave
has given others some pause, for
in terms of young men and women
already born it gives every indica-
tion of forcing upon the nation’s

9

=

Year Begins

colleges by 1970 an _ enrollment
double the present size. What does
this fact mean for Washington and
Lee? Should its student body be
retained at about its current level
of 1000, or should it be advanced
to 1250, or to 1500, or to some
other figure? What are the ad-
vantages of remaining a small in-
stitution? For that matter, what is
a small institution? Some which
claim to be “small” are less than
half the size of Washington and
Lee; others with which the Univer-
sity believes itself comparable con-
sider themselves small despite en-
rollments two or more times that
of the University.

Moreover, what _ responsibility
does Washington and Lee have to
meet a portion of the burden posed
by this vast oncoming army of col-
lege-age students that is now be-
ginning to leave the nation’s pub-
lic and private secondary schools
in ever increasing numbers? How
long can Washington and Lee re-
sist the growing pressures that

 

Registration, 1955

their numbers will represent? And
if they cannot be resisted, what are
the possibilities for solving the com-
plex problems of educational eco-
nomics that will face an indepen-
dent college of limited endowment,
staff, and physical plant?

These are questions of no little
moment. But it is doubtful that
they occurred to those in that long
registration line, or that their
knowledge of student-body — size
extended beyond the information
gained at Freshman Camp, or at
fraternity pre-rush-week briefings:
that this year’s freshman class of
296 was only three students more
than last year. They did not know
the figures behind the figures, those
which tell how many high and pre-
paratory school graduates applied
for admission, where they came
from, and how many were accepted,
how many had to be turned away.

The fact is that 736 young men
submitted formal applications
(those accompanied by the required
fee) to Washington and Lee for ad-

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

mission to the Class of 1959, com-
pared with 721 last year and 672
in 1953. These figures do not in-
clude the many additional inquiries
which prospective students made
of the Registrar’s and Dean’s Offices.
Out of those applicants a total of
478 were accepted, 296 of whom
entered on September 14. As to
the 182 who declined, the Dean’s
Office points out that this figure
is not unusual in the light of the
current practice to make applica-
tion to two or more institutions in
order to be reasonably assured of
admission to one.

All applicants were required to
take the Scholastic Aptitude ‘Test
of the College Entrance Examina-
tion Board, the so-called “College
Boards.” While no score automat-
ically disqualifies an applicant, the
results of this test give one more
valuable indication of what may be
expected of a student academically
and add one more item to the
many which figure in the ‘“weigh-
ing’ process by which the Univer-
sity selects for admission the young
men possessing the greatest promise
for full collegiate success. Parenthet-
ically, it is interesting to note that

while Washington and Lee was the
first men’s college in the South to
make the Scholastic Aptitude Test
a prerequisite to admission, it is
no longer unique in this respect.
By 1956 Sewanee, Davidson, Fur-
man, Centre, Rice, Catholic Uni-
versity, and Georgetown will re-
quire the test of all applicants.

A study of the geographical
background of the Class of 1959
indicates that Washington and Lee’s
freshmen continue to be drawn
primarily from the South, which
includes the border states of Mary-
land, Missouri, West Virginia, and
Oklahoma. Some 59 per cent, or 176
boys, come from this area, while
28 per cent, or 83 boys, represent
the East, those states on the Atlan-
tic seaboard north of Maryland.
Those from all other areas, 37 in
all, make up 13 per cent of the
class. In 1954, 64 per cent of the
entering class were Southerners, a
similar 28 per cent were from the
East, and only 8 per cent from the
the other areas.

In granting admission Washing-
ton and Lee’s officials seek to main-
tain at least an even balance be-
tween public and private school

graduates. The division in_ the
Class of 1959, therefore, is consid-
erably more encouraging than for
the Class of 1958. Fifty-two per cent
of the freshmen, or 156 boys, are
from public schools, as compared
with only 44 per cent in 1954. Of
these 156, 97 freshmen, or 33 per
cent of the fall class, come from
southern public schools. Seventy
students, or exactly half of the pri-
vate school graduates, studied at
southern schools.

Virginia again led all states with
41 freshmen. Other states and
foreign countries and their repre-
sentations included New York
with 26; New Jersey 23; Maryland
21; Pennsylvania 17; Florida 16;
Ohio and Texas 14; Tennessee 12;
West Virginia 11; District of Co-
lumbia and Kentucky 9; Louisiana
8; Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois
and Massachusetts 7; Alabama and
Arkansas 6; Missouri and South
Carolina 4; Michigan, North Caro-
lina, and Oklahoma 3; Colorado,
Mississippi, Rhode Island, Colom-
bia, and Sweden 2; California, Del-
aware, Iowa, Bermuda, Canada,
France, Germany and Hawaii 1.

Between dips in the pool and keen competition, the Class of 1959 found time to learn much about Washington and Lee—and the ROTC

OCTOBER 1955

3

Prior to their registration on
Saturday, September 17, a record
total of 265 of the new students
attended the 24th Annual Fresh-
man Camp at Natural Bridge. In
between dips in the Gate House
pool, trips to the famous Bridge
itself, and keen football, softball,
and volleyball competition, they
found time to learn much about
Washington and Lee from Univer-
sity officials, faculty members,
R.O.T.C. officers, the entire coach-
ing staff, the president of the stu-
dent body, and other student lead-
ers and representatives of the vari-
ous extra-curricular activities.

Registration for the entire stu-
dent body, except for those in law,
was completed on ‘Tuesday, Sep-
tember 20, and classes began at
8:25 am. the next day. At the
opening assembly, Dr. Gaines
turned over the lectern to his long-
time friend and eminent southern
journalist, John Temple Graves.
Mr. Graves, in urging the students
to take advantage of the current era
of peace and prosperity to develop
themselves as individuals, predicted
that the world may be on the verge
of permanent peace, albeit an
“atomic peace,’’ and suggested that
the year 1955-56 may be remem-
bered as the year “the lights came
on” in the world.

So it was that Washington and
Lee began its 207th year. It is ex-
pected to be a year of challenge,
of opportunity, and of activity. Fac-
ulty members will enjoy another
modest salary increase thanks in
large measure to increased giving to
the annual Alumni Fund last year.
The Scholarship Committee will
award to promising young men as
much as $90,000 in scholarship as-
sistance, compared with the $40,000
which they could award two years
ago. ‘he new academic building, re-
cently named Jessie Ball duPont
Hall, will see its first full year of
productive service.

Varsity football will be renewed
in October under a new athletic
policy. Homecoming will take place
on October 22. The first annual

4

Parents’ Day is scheduled for No-
vember 19, and is designed as one of
numerous steps being taken to
bring the parents of students into
closer relationship with the Univer-
sity. In the Spring of 1956 the
Mock Convention will attract na-
tionwide interest. And somewhat
later members of the Classes of
1906 and 1931 will return to the
campus for special celebrations
marking the 50th and esth anni-
versaries of their graduation from
the University.

In short, it promises to be not
only a full year but a significant
year as well.

THE UNIVERSITY

m DURING THE 1954-55 COLLEGE year
Washington and Lee received in
gifts a total of $397,363. Of this
amount, $75,788 was for current
operations; the balance of $321,575
was for various endowment pur-
poses and is exclusive of the $250,-
ooo recently received from an anon-
ymous donor. (see Scholarships) .

Alumni giving for current oper-
ations totaled $60,771. An addi-
tional $44,691 was given for various
endowment purposes, bringing the
total of alumni giving to Wash-
ington and Lee during 1954-1955 to
$105,462.

Corporations and other business
concerns contributed $35,017. Of
this amount $11,517 came through
the Virginia Foundation for Inde-
pendent Colleges, of which Wash-
ington and Lee is one of twelve
member institutions.

The remaining $256,884 was
given by other friends of the Uni-
versity, the largest portion being
a gift of $254,112 from Mrs. Alfred
I. duPont to create the Jessie Ball
duPont-Francis P. Gaines Fund.
One-half of the income from this
Fund is to be used for augmenting
faculty salaries, the other half as
scholarship aid for needy and prom-
ising boys.

Gifts such as these are sincerely
and deeply appreciated. Not only

do they help to satisfy some of the
University’s urgent and basic needs,
but also they give strong testimony
to the faith that alumni and others
have in Washington and Lee, its
educational program, and its abili-
ty to meet with wisdom and
strength the challenging educa-
tional opportunities of the future.

Without in any way minimizing
the great significance of these and
other gifts already received, it can
be pointed out that the University’s
need for additional funds remains
great, that it is many times that
which was received during the past
college year. For operating expenses
alone it is estimated that an addi-
tional $85,000 per year is required,
a large portion of it in order to in-
crease the salaries of faculty mem-
bers to a more satisfactory level. An
additional $1,000,000, or the equl-
valent in assured annual income, is
necessary if Washington and Lee’s
scholarship offerings are to be more
adequate to the need (see Scholar-
ships). And while the needs have
not yet been clarified fully, it is
certain that several million dollars
will be required for essential addi-
tions and renovations to the Uni-
versity’s physical plant. Hence, with
gratitude for past beneficience and
for the faith thus demonstrated,
Washington and Lee will intensify
its efforts to secure the new funds
with which to meet the many de-
mands placed upon it and as yet
unsatisfied.

m TWO BUILDINGS AT Washington
and Lee, one of them over 30 years
old and the other almost brand
new, are going by new names this
year. he Board of Trustees at its
June meeting approved naming the
chemistry building James Lewis
Howe Hall in honor of Dr. Howe,
professor of chemistry, emeritus,
who still serves Washington and Lee
as the University Historian. Dr.
Howe retired from active teaching
in 1938 after 44 years of service. The
Board also designated the new
academic building as Jessie Ball
duPont Hall, honoring Mrs. Alfred

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

I. duPont, one of the University’s
greatest friends and _ benefactors.
duPont Hall, which was put into
use last spring, houses office facili-
ties for eleven professors and class-
rooms for nine departments.

OVER 50 COLLEGE athletic trainers
gathered at Washington and Lee
during the last week of May to at-
tend the two-day session of the Sis-
ley-Lutz Memorial Trainers’ Clinic.
‘The clinic, which was devoted to a
review of new methods and equip-
ment for keeping athletes physically
fit, honored the late John M. “Red”
Sisley of Washington and Lee and
Fitz Lutz of the University of North
Carolina, prominent southern train-
ers, both of whom died in October
1954. It was under the direction of
Washington and Lee’s new trainer,
Delbert A. “Deb” Davis. Several
outstanding orthopedic surgeons
and other experts spoke on new,
speedy ways to put injured players
back into service without risk of
permanent harm to damaged mus-
cles and joints.

mH SOME TWENTY-ONE MEMBERS of
Washington and Lee’s faculty
busied themselves this summer with
travel abroad, writing, or study and
research on favorite projects. Eight-
een conducted their work with the
assistance of the John M. Glenn
grants-in-aid program, which has

PusEy—to Germany

OCTOBER 1955

 

as its ultimate purpose to enhance
undergraduate instruction at the
University and which made avail-
able to these faculty members for
various summer-time activities a
total of $7,100.

Among faculty members return-
ing from abroad was Dr. David W.
Sprunt, director of religious activi-
ties, who spent six weeks in the
Holy Land with eleven other Amer-
ican religious studies professors.
Funds for the sojourn were admin-
istered by the Department of He-
brew of New York University.
While in Israel, Dr. Sprunt repre-
sented Washington and Lee at the
dedication of Bar-Ilan University,

 

JUNKIN—to Italy and France

an institution founded by Ameri-
cans near Tel Aviv.

Dr. William W. Pusey, III, spent
the summer in Germany, where he
studied advanced courses in the
German language and national lit-
erature. Dr. Marion M. Junkin, ’27,
professor of fine arts, toured Italy
and France studying art works im-
portant in the art history courses
which he teaches. Dr. Marshall W.
Fishwick, associate professor of
American studies, also visited Eu-
rope during the summer to gather
material and slides on the ancient
and medieval worlds for use in
history and fine arts courses. En
route he lectured to student and
immigrant groups for the Council

 

SPRUNT—to the Holy Land

on Student Travel. And, after a
full year of study in Austria and
Italy, Dr. William A. Jenks, ’39,
returned to Lexington to resume
his duties as associate professor of
history. His work abroad was made
possible by a Fulbright Scholarship
and a Ford Foundation grant.
Numerous faculty members put
in long hours at their desks pre-
paring manuscripts for textbooks
and articles. Dr. Esmarch S. Gil-
reath, new head of the Department
of Chemistry, began work on a
textbook in the field of inorganic
chemistry. It will be his second
work in this field in recent years.
Dr. Jack N. Behrman, associate pro-
fessor of economics, joined with Dr.
W. E. Schmidt of George Wash-
ington University in writing a text
on international economics. Re-
vision of Industrial and Commer-
cial Geography by Dr. M. Ogden
Phillips, Wilson Professor of Eco-
nomics, and Dr. J. Russell Smith
of Columbia was completed this
summer and the new manuscript
sent to the publisher. The text is
a widely-used study of the world’s
sources of raw materials and man-
ufactured goods. And work on an
introductory textbook in political
science occupied the vacation
months of Dr. J. Harvey Wheeler.
In the Department of Romance
Languages, Dr. L. L. Barrett en-
gaged in the translation of a Brazil-

5

ian novel and prepared a combina-
tion anthology and literary history
for his third-year Spanish course,
while Professor George J. Irwin
worked on the translation of Ray-
mond Aron’s Introduction a la
philosophie de VU historve.

Paxton Davis, assistant profes-
sor of journalism, completed work
on his second short novel soon
after Bluebook Magazine accepted
his first story, written during the
summer of 1954. Publication date
in the magazine has not been an-
nounced.

The July issue of Virginia Min-
erals contained an article by Dr.
Marcellus H. Stow, professor of
geology, dealing with uranium de-
posits in the Old Dominion.

Meanwhile, other professors who
were not putting their own
thoughts on paper were getting new
ideas from a multiplicity of sources.
Dr. A. Ross Borden, associate pro-
fessor of English, did research in
English literature of the Eliza-
bethan age at the Huntington Li-
brary in California, while in Lex-
ington contemporary literature was
under special study by Dr. Marvin
B. Perry, Jr., also an associate pro-
fessor of English. Accounting pro-
fessor Jay D. Cook continued re-
search and writing on his doctoral
dissertation at Ohio State Univer-
sity; Dr. Robert F. Gemmill, assist-
ant professor of commerce, worked
on the theory of taxation; and Ed-
ward C. Atwood, Jr., assistant pro-
fessor of economics, spent the sum-
mer in New York City studying
the internal operations of the
Bankers ‘Trust.

Dr. R. Winter Royston, associate
professor of mathematics, attended
seminars and audited classes in
mathematics and statistics at the
University of Michigan, while at the
University of Minnesota Dr.
Charles W. Turner, associate pro-
fessor of history, studied the history
of the American West and South-
eastern Asia. Journalism professor
O. W. Riegel carried on research
relating to technological and mana-
gerial advances in the mass media
fields. And Dr. Allen W. Moger

6

continued his research into the
papers and correspondence of Gen-
eral Robert E. Lee, a project which
he began several years ago.

Dr. J. Keith Shillington, assistant
professor of chemistry, joined by
George S. Denning, ’54, and Ogden
B. Ramsay, ’55, remained on the
campus where he directed a Na-
tional Science Foundation research
project on the resolution of op-
tically active compounds through
the carbonyl group. ‘The Founda-
tion has provided $6,000 toward the
two-year project.

mH THE APPOINTMENT during the
summer of instructors in account-
ing, mathematics, and physical edu-
cation brought Washington and
Lee’s faculty to full strength for the
opening of the college year in Sep-
tember. ‘Thomas E. Ennis, of Salis-
bury, North Carolina, who received
his Master of Business Administra-
tion degree at the University of
North Carolina this summer, has
joined the staff as an instructor in
accounting. Eldridge H. Moore of
Richmond has taken over duties
as an instructor in the mathematics
department, easing a teacher short-
age which has existed there for
several semesters. He holds a B.A.
degree from Hampden-Sydney Col-
lege where he was a member of
ODK and vice-president of the stu-
dent body.

Fugene Corrigan, a Baltimore
native, has joined the physical edu-
cation staff, with additional duties
as lacrosse and soccer coach. He re-
places Charles J. Herbert, who re-
signed in August to accept a posi-
tion with a Maryland real estate
firm. Corrigan is a 1952 B.A. grad-
uate of Duke University where for
four years he won All-American
honorable mention in lacrosse. Af-
ter graduation he went directly to
lacrosse-conscious St. Paul’s School
in Baltimore where he served for
three years as head coach. During
this time he played for the Mt.
Washington Lacrosse Club, which is
considered to have the best stick-
men in the nation.

In Herbert’s departure Washing-

ton and Lee loses one of the most
energetic and successful men the
coaching staff has boasted in many
years. On the remnants of a 1953
soccer team, which scored only five
goals while losing seven contests,
he built a 1954 squad which won
five, lost three, and tied two. The
1955 NCAA soccer guide described
Washington and Lee as the most
improved team among the southern
independents. And in lacrosse, Her-
bert, an All-American player him-
self, molded a team that chalked up
the best season’s record in Blue and
White history. The Generals won
five, lost two, and tied one, and
were tagged as a budding power in
lacrosse circles.

While at Washington and Lee,
Herbert’s enthusiasm and his touch
for successful promotion helped to
make the Indian game a spectator
sport. Extremely popular with the
students, his loss will be keenly
felt. Illness in his family, however,
and a desire to be closer to his Bal-
timore home prompted his decision
to leave the University.

m ALL FULL-TIME faculty members
and other employees of Washington
and Lee received a five-per cent
salary increase effective September
1. It was the ninth such increase
since World War II and the second
within a year. In announcing it Dr.
Gaines noted that it was made pos-
sible through “increased donations
from alumni and gifts from leading
corporations and industry, princi-
pally in Virginia.”

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

An Open Letter to All Alumni

Bx. FOR THE DECISION made twenty-three years ago to create the Alumni Fund, there undoubtedly
has been no action concerning the Fund more significant than that taken by the Alumni Fund

Council on October 1:

The Council set the goal for the 1955-56 Alumni Fund at $100,000.

Why the large increase over previous years?

The reason is clear. The University’s needs for additional unrestricted funds for operating purposes
are well defined and urgent. They total $85,000 annually. The largest single part is required for faculty
salaries: (1) to restore to faculty members the purchasing power they have lost during the post-war years
and (2) to better enable Washington and Lee to meet the increasingly intense competition for well-
qualified replacements as from time to time such replacements become necessary. Other of the Uni-
versity’s important operating needs include funds to supplement the salaries of other University per-
sonnel, to purchase books for the library, for special equipment, lectures, seminars, concerts, exhibits,
and professional travel, and last, but by no means least, for general maintenance.

Is it possible to reach the goal?

In the opinion of the Fund Council, yes; and for the following reasons:

m Ihe needs of the University have been defined clearly in Development Program
studies conducted during the past two years.

a During the same period new procedures and new equipment have been introduced
into the Alumni Office, making it possible to organize and service the Alumni Fund
program far better than ever before.

a The Fund Council is convinced that there is a large potential for giving to be de-
veloped in Washington and Lee’s alumni body, and as evidence of that points to the
alumni funds of many similar institutions with which our fund should be com-
parable, but is not.

m The Council is convinced, also, that a portion of the alumni body much larger
than last year’s 25.3 per cent will give annually to the University when the need for
their doing so is placed alongside their affection for Washington and Lee and their
appreciation for what the University has done for them.

m The Council believes that many alumni, when fully apprised of the need, will want
to make annual gifts well in excess of last year’s $23.29 average if financially able.

m And finally, the Council feels that with the prosperity of the country at an all-time
high, it is logical to hope for a maximum gain in annual giving at this time.

Nothing less than the thoughtful assistance of every alumnus is necessary to attain the goal that has
been set and the funds that Washington and Lee needs. When you hear from your Class Agent, your
Regional Agent, or from the Alumni Office itself, respond thoughtfully and proportionately—in pro-
portion to your concern for education of the kind Washington and Lee offers and in proportion to
your individual ability.

AMONG OTHER GIFTS received by
the University during the final days
of the 1954-55 session was a substan-
tial library belonging to the late
John W. Davis, ’95, of New York.
Mrs. Charles P. Healy of New
York, Mr. Davis’s daughter, pre-
sented the University with her fath-
er’s complete law library and an
extensive collection of historical
and biographical works dealing
mostly with the United States. Mrs.
Healy also gave to Washington and
Lee a magnificent portrait of the
former Ambassador to Great
Britain and 1924 presidential can-
didate. These gifts were in ad-
dition to a $25,000 bequest to the
University provided by the famed
lawyer in his will.

Corps Commander for 1955-56. A
senior, Gooch will hold the rank of
cadet colonel. He succeeds Lowell
D. Hamric of Lexington.

Gilbert R. McSpadden, Jr., of
Memphis, ‘Tennessee, will serve as
Gooch’s executive officer with the
rank of cadet lieutenant colonel.
Both men served as company com-
manders last year.

mH WASHINGTON AND LEE’S ROTC has
a new commanding officer this year.
Lt. Col. Richard W. Jones, Jr., who
headed the program since its be-
ginning in 1951, was relieved of
his duties early in August by Lt.
Col. Charles E. Coates, Jr., a veter-
an infantry commander and a mem-
ber of an “old Army family.”

‘The transfer of a command from
a Transportation Corps specialist
to a combat training expert com-
pleted the switch by Washington
and Lee’s unit from a ‘Transporta-
tion Corps program to a Branch
General program. ‘The latter is de-
signed to give young men officer

training of a more general nature.
‘The reserve officers who graduated
last June were the first Washington
and Lee cadets to get their gold
bars under the Branch General pro-
gram and to be assigned to the
branch of service most in need of
replacements rather than to the
Transportation Corps. Emphasis
during the four-year Branch Gen-
eral course will be upon training
for the infantry, armor, and artil-
lery, the Army’s principal combat
arms. ‘This changeover is a part of
a general Army ROTC revision
which has removed virtually all
campus units from the field of
specialist training.

The new PMS&T (professor of
military science and tactics) is a
West Point man who graduated in
1939 as a distinguished cadet. His
extensive World War II combat
record includes participation in the
invasions of Saipan and Okinawa.
Son of a retired colonel, he and
three brothers elected to follow mil-
itary careers. ‘Iwo of them were
killed in action, one in North Afri-
ca and one in Korea. Col. Coates
recently returned from Thailand
where he served as a member of a
team of American advisors to the
Royal ‘Thai Army. He and Mrs.
Coates have three children, Charles,
III, age 7; Robert, age 4; and Sal-
ly Ann, age 1.

Col. Jones, who left Lexington in
late August enroute to his new as-
signment with the United Forces
at Rochefort, France, left behind
him a distinguished record. ‘Typical
of that record is the showing made
by Washington and Lee cadets in
summer camp competiton with stu-
dents from other colleges at Fort
George G. Meade, Maryland, and at
Fort Eustis, Virginia. Sixty-one ca-
dets trained at the former; the final
five graduates for the ‘Transporta-
tion Corps completed their re-
quirements at the latter.

In all, 1,065 cadets from thirty
colleges were in training at Fort
Meade. The school contingents did
not train as units, but were dis-

tributed throughout training com-
panies that number approximately
160 men each. ‘Three Washington
and Lee cadets— R. Gordon Gooch
of Fort Worth, Texas, Charles A.
MacIntosh of Haverford, Pennsyl-
vania, and Gilbert R. McSpadden,
Jv. of Memphis, “‘Tennessee—won
honors as top cadets in their re-
spective companies. Fourteen of
Washington and Lee’s sixty-one
man group were cited as Distin-
guished Military Students. While
no official information is as yet
available to indicate how these men
compared with other colleges in the
final over-all standings, Washing-
ton and Lee men did finish third
in rifle marksmanship.

At Fort Eustis the University’s
five cadets achieved an eighth place
ranking for Washington and Lee
among twenty-seven colleges.

And, as if the foregoing were not
enough, the three officers and two
enlisted men of Washington and
Lee's Military Department who
helped train cadets at summer camp
all received “superior” ratings.

SCHOLARSHIPS

m ONE OF THE MOST HEARTENING de-
velopments at Washington and Lee
during the past year has had to do
with the increased funds which
have become available for granting
scholarship aid to students of out-
standing promise. ‘The lack of such
funds has long been one of the
prime concerns of both faculty
and administration. It is not sur-
prising, therefore, that the special
committee appointed in conjunc-
tion with the Development Pro-
gram to study student needs gave
top priority to the necessity for
procuring additional scholarship
funds. More specifically, the com-
mittee recommended that $2,000,-
ooo in additional endowment, or
the equivalent in assured annual
income, be sought for undergradu-
ate awards, and another $250,000
for Law School awards.

During the past year large strides
have been taken toward the reali-
zation of these goals. At the
1955 Commencement exercises Dr.
Gaines announced the establish-

ment of the Letitia Pate Evans
Scholarships. ‘These include ten of
the largest Washington and Lee
has ever offered, carrying stipends of
$1,250 a year, or $5,000 for a four-
year period. ‘Twenty other Evans
Scholarships were established at
$550 a year, or $2,600 for the four-
year period. ‘These awards will be
based upon character, relative need,
and promise of collegiate success.

Less than three months later Dr.
Gaines announced the receipt of a
gift of $250,000 from an anony-
mous donor to be used primarily
for scholarships. ‘These new awards
will be known as the Robert E. Lee
Scholarships, and will carry annual
stipends ranging as high at $1,800.
Criteria for awarding them will be
similar to those governing the
award of Evans Scholarships, with
the additional stipulation that spe-
cial consideration be given to South-
ern students.

‘This latest gift, which is to be ex-
pended over a period of years, to-
gether with the Evans Scholarships
and the duPont-Gaines Scholar-

ships which were established a year
ago with an endowment of $126,000,
will increase Washington and Lee’s
total scholarship awards from ap-
proximately $40,000 per year, the
level at which they stood two years
ago, to $g0,000 annually* begin-
ning with the 1956-57 college year.
‘To put it another way, this gain
represents the realization of about
$1,250,000 Of a $2,250,000 goal.

In recent years Washington and
Lee has provided scholarship assist-
ance to approximately 12 or 13 per
cent of its student body. ‘The com-
mittee reporting on student needs
stated its conviction that within a
ten-year period Washington and
Lee should be in a position to ex-
tend scholarship assistance to be-
tween 15 and 20 per cent of the
University’s total enrollment. Even
this goal will fall considerably
short of the percentage currently
achieved by many of the nation’s
colleges and universities with which
Washington and Lee is similar. For
this reason, 1t seems proper to ex-
pect that beyond the goals set for
the decade immediately ahead,
Washington and Lee's long-range
aim will be for a still greater
measure of scholarship assistance,
both percentage-wise and dollar-
wise, for its students.

FOOTBALL

m@ THE FAMILIAR SOUNDS OF football
practice are echoing across the
campus from Wilson Field again
this month, and for faculty and stu-
dents alike it is a welcome return of
varsity competition to Washington
and Lee. In all quarters interest is
running high as to how the Gen-
erals will fare after a one-year ab-
sence from intercollegiate contests.

A squad of 43 players answered
Coach Bill Chipley’s call for early
practice, a response which Chipley
described as “gratifying.” Included

*This is entirely apart from athletic
grants-in-aid which the University is
under obligation to continue for those
who were recipients of such aid under the
previous athletic policy.

10

were nine freshmen candidates who
wrote to the Generals’ head coach
during the summer requesting per-
mission to attend early drills. ‘he
team strength was augmented some-
what by freshman players when
orientation and registration activi-
ties were completed.

‘T'wo-a-day practice sessions were
begun on September 8 and _ con-
tinued through September 19 when
a normal afternoon schedule for
workouts was adopted. ‘The general
pattern of training during the early
sessions was for conditioning and
signal drills at the morning period,
with pads and scrimmage on tap for
the afternoon practice.

‘Team morale is high, and the
coaching staff is impressed by the
fine spirit being shown by _ the
“play for fun” squad. Chipley cred-
its strict adherence to practice
schedules with being a contributing
factor to the team’s attitude. ‘““They
know we're going to work for an
hour and a half at each practice
and they know we're going to work
hard every minute of the way,”
Chipley explains. “We let the boys
know where they stand on every-
thing and they like it that way.”

Assisting Chipley with the
coaching duties are his two full-time
assistants, Boyd Williams, who di-
rected last fall’s interim football
activities, and ex-General star half-
back Charlie Harrington. ‘Two
part-time coaches, Stuart Barbour,
a law student who played a lot of
football for Virginia, and Roger
Bond, who played at Washington
and Lee under Coach Carl Wise,
are helping out, also.

Included on the team roster are
several players who came to Wash-
ington and Lee through the recruit-
ing efforts of Coach Wise under the
old program. There is no compul-
sion upon these boys to play, and
the fact that they are taking part
under the new program is a heart-
ening sign to Chipley. Several of
these boys are slated for key roles
in the Generals’ plans for the sea-
son, but Coach Chipley emphasizes
strongly that no position on the

team is “sewed up,” and he adds
that he would not be surprised if
some starting berths are occupied
by freshmen and upperclass ‘“new-
comers” to varsity football.

With the opening game sched-
uled for October 8, the coaches are
having more time than usual to
whip their team into shape. Great
stress is being placed both on
individual and on group coaching.
Chipley feels that in Williams and
Harrington he has two of the finest
men possible for this job. An over-
all characteristic of the squad is
a lack of experience in college-
caliber football, but Chipley says
many of his least experienced boys
are showing remarkable response to
coaching efforts.

While none of the coaches will
admit that they are optimistic about
the team’s prospects, no one is dis-
couraged. In fact, concerning sev-
eral players they show almost un-
bridled enthusiasm.

One of the Generals getting rave
notices from his coaches is Lee
Brantley, a senior guard from Bris-
tol, Virginia. He started at Wash-
ington and Lee under Coach Wise,
then left school for a year before
returning at mid-term last winter.
Coach Williams says he is one of
the finest linemen he has seen.

Coach Chipley is especially proud
of his corps of fullbacks. Four of
them are over the 200-pound mark.
Heading the list is junior Alex
Platt of Greenwich, Connecticut, a
boy Chipley says could make any
football team in the Southern Con-
ference. But the promising play of
senior Dewey Oxner of Greenville,
South Carolina, could force a shake-
up in backfield plans to allow full
and simultaneous use of the talents
of both. Backing them up are soph-
omore Rufe Safford of Wyoming,
Ohio, and Dick Benes, a fine fresh-
man from Cleveland.

Halfbacks are in good supply
with seniors Don Stine of Cumber-
land, Maryland, and Carl Bailey
of New York City the most likely
bets for starting roles. But fresh-

N AUTO-WEARY, sun-tanned tour-

ist stood in the alcove at the

Lee Chapel last summer, gazing

with great interest at the recumbent

statue of General Lee, seen through

the iron bars of the gate which sepa-

rates the statue chamber from the
Chapel proper.

“Why is he in prison?’ she
wanted to know.

With a quiet patience that has
come with answering multitudes of
such questions, Mrs. William Cabell
Flournoy, Chapel curator and hos-
tess for the United Daughters of
the Confederacy, explained to the
lady that the bars do not repre-
sent confinement, but merely form
an ornamental gateway.

When the enlightened tourist and
her husband had descended the
stairs to the Lee Museum below the
Chapel, Mrs. Flournory took a
small composition book from her
desk drawer and entered another
notation, one of dozens relating to
the odd and unusual comments of
visitors, the strange questions, the
fantastic misconceptions many per-
sons have about Lee, his life, and
his final resting place.

Mrs. Flournoy has ample oppor-
tunity to add to her notes. From
October 1953 to October 1954, a
total of 22,410 persons signed the
visitor’s register at Lee Chapel.
Countless others failed to add their
names to the book, making an ac-
curate count impossible.

Figures for the current fiscal
year are running well ahead of last
year, and Mrs. Flournoy estimates
that over 23,000 will have regis-
tered by October 1.

In July and August, the busiest
months of the Shenandoah Valley
tourist season, some 10,000 persons
saw the Valentine statue, looked at
Lee’s office, examined ‘Traveller’s
bones, and browsed through the
hundreds of curios in the Lee Mu-
seum. [hey come from all over the
world. ‘The register records address-
es from every state and from almost
every foreign nation. As many come
from the North and West as from
the South, and among the northern

visitors are many who voice a gen-
uine admiration of General Lee.

A gentleman from Ohio told Mrs.
Flournoy: “Lee is my ideal. ‘There
has never been anyone big enough,
or small enough, to criticize his
character.”

Among the thousands of recent
visitors was the custodian of Lin-
coln’s ‘Tomb. He, too, said he was a
ereat admirer of Lee, and when he
visited the museum he purchased a
large portrait of the General.

More than 23,000 visitors signed the Chapel register last year; countless others did not

‘The current revival of interest in
the War Between the States has
been cited as a reason for increased
attendance this past year. Mrs.
Flournoy says there are more and
more cogent, scholarly questions
asked by visitors today than there
were previously.

“There are a great many young
boys showing profound, intelligent
interest in the War,” she points out.
“I am amazed sometimes by the
questions they ask.”

 

Making up a large percentage of
the spring visitors are school chil-
dren on conducted tours. From late
March until schools close in June
they came by the busload, and
in May alone over 3,000 youngsters
passed through Lee Chapel.

For these touring groups, both
children and adult, Mrs. Flournoy
has a special little speech which
she delivers to the group seated in
the Chapel pews. She touches only
on highlights—the history of the
University, the valuable portraits
which hang on the Chapel walls,
the Valentine statue, and the mu-
seum. She has been over it so many
times that it comes almost auto-
matically, but her delivery is always
fresh and spurs invariably the inter-
est of her listeners.

For the individual and for family
groups, she explains only the re-
cumbent statue, that it is not a
likeness of Lee on his deathbed or
in his tomb, but rather represents
him resting in his tent on the battle-
field.

‘To this information she has re-
ceived some interesting responses,
including “I don’t see no tent,” and
“Huh, he went to bed with his
clothes on.”

Many tourists think Lee’s tomb is
in the statue chamber, not in the
mausoleum on the basement level.
Others think he is buried at Arling-
ton, or Richmond; and a few be-
lieve he is buried on the battlefield.

“AI of these have some logic, but
I spend my days correcting people
about General Lee and the statue,”
Mrs. Flournoy says.

Canadians, she adds, show a re-
markable degree of intelligence
concerning America’s Civil War
history. And she says a very large
number of visitors are colored peo-
ple, and they, too, are usually well-
informed about Lee and the history
of his time.

Of course, everyone who sees Lee
Chapel also sees Washington and
Lee University. But not everyone
xnows just what the _ white-
columned buildings are. Mrs.
Flournoy has been asked if the

Mrs. FLOURNOoY—from answering multitudes of questions has come a quiet patience

University was a hotel, a country
club, or if General Lee owned
“all those red houses.”

But, by and large, Lee Chapel
and its proximity to the University
campus provide Washington and
Lee with one of its greatest public
relations vehicles. Visitors often
comment on the beauty of the cam-
pus and the friendliness and good
appearance of the students, and
impressions gained in a few mom-
ents at Lee Chapel often transforms
Chapel visitors into University
friends.

Lee Chapel is a focal point of
many phases of University life.
Students are introduced to _ its
straight-backed pews early in their
college careers, for much of the
freshman orientation program takes
place there. Other meetings follow
throughout the entire college year.
Before long, students tend to take
the Chapel and its historic signifi-
cance for granted, but almost no
one passes four years at Washing-
ton and Lee without at least once
spending an hour in the museum.
The Chapel is an especially popu-
lar attraction for students whose
parents or girl friends visit the cam-
pus for the first time.

Because the tourist flow does not
halt to accommodate University
use of Lee Chapel, many unusual

CCTOBER 1955

scenes have taken place. Once dur-
ing a speech of a visiting dignitary,
listeners were surprised to see a
rather rotund, camera-draped tour-
ist and his equally rotund wife,
both attired in brilliant sports shirts
and slacks, amble unconcernedly
down the aisle, up onto the speakers
platform and into the — statue
alcove, completely oblivious to the
three or four hundred persons in
the Chapel. ‘The speaker, to say the
least, was a bit shaken by the ex-
perience.

“The poise of the average tour-
ist is remarkable,’ adds Mrs. Flour-
noy.

During the past summer the Uni-
versity took steps to help preserve
the dignity of the Chapel. For some
years more and more tourists had
taken to wearing shorts, and noth-
ing was said to those who would
visit Lee Chapel in this garb. But
as shorts got shorter, University
officials’ faces got longer, and the
result was a decision to post small
signs requesting adults in shorts not
to enter the Chapel. The request
has been well-received, and many
visitors, realizing for the first time
that the Chapel is also the religious
center of the University, have re-
turned to their cars for long trous-
ers or skirts.

For all the many thousands of

tourists, Washington and Lee re-
ceives no tangible profit from the
proceeds of the small souvenir shop
at the museum or from the recep-
tacles for voluntary contributions.
Donations average from $1,200 to
$1,400 annually, while the gross
income of the shop is close to $4,000
a year. Iwo small endowment funds
provide around $350 annually for
Lee Chapel. On the other side of
the ledger is the cost of maintain-
ing the building, lights, heat, insur-
ance, janitor service, and the sal-

An alumnus, viewing his alma mater, concludes

Irs PEOPLE wuo

REALLY
MATTER

RAYMOND D. SMITH, JR., 755

XACTLY FOUR YEARS AGO, I came
E to Lexington as a member of
the freshman class. I was hot, tired,
scared, and uncertain. I remained
uncertain of Washington and Lee
for the better part of my _ first
two years there. But as I got bet-
ter acquainted with the school and
learned what it stands for, I came
to love it. And a large part of my
love for the University is based on
the realization that—like all man-
made institutions—it has a great
many faults. But because of these
faults, we have the privilege—and
I do think of it as a privilege—of
working to correct our faults.

We can all recite the material
lacks of our University: the need for
more money, an auditorium, a din-
ing hall, expansion and moderniza-
tion of facilities for our laboratory
sciences, and so forth. It seems to
me, however, that people are really
what matter, so I will deal prima-
rily with the Washington and Lee
family: our student body, our facul-
ty, and our alumni. Among our
alumni I include friends of the
University and parents of students.

Our student body is a very fine
group. I enjoyed meeting men from
many different parts of the country
and especially several from abroad
whom I number among the. best
friends I made at college. I hope
we may be able to bring more for-
eign students to Washington and
Lee each year, and also increase
the variety of backgrounds—in
other respects—evident there.

I think one of the greatest of our
assets always has been the relatively
small size of our student body. By

14

your senior year, you know or know
of nearly every member of the fac-
ulty and student body, and our tra-
dition of speaking to everyone we
meet on campus, for example,
thereby loses much of the super-
ficiality which is sometimes felt to
be attached to it.

I have always been quite im-
pressed by the achievements of in-
dividuals in our student body—by
our Moot Court Team which
reached the national semi-finals, by
our Rhodes Scholar, by the achieve-
ments of our top graduates in the
best graduate schools, by our Quiz
Bowl ‘Team. But it is primarily
Just a very small nucleus of leaders
in scholarship and outside activities
which upholds the reputation of
this University outside of Lexing-
ton. There are a great many others
in the student body who neither
contribute anything to Washington
and Lee nor take very much of
value from their four years there.
They manage a “gentleman’s C”
average, possibly afhliate themselves
with the Mongolian Minks, and
make it to graduation some way. _

I do not propose that we aim to-
ward a student body made up en-
tirely of Phi Beta Kappas, All-
American lacrosse players, and Pub-
lication Board presidents. I do feel,
however, that the average stand-
ards of the whole student body can
and should be raised. ‘This job can
be initiated by redoubling efforts
to raise our entrance requirements.
One of the best ways to do this is
to increase the size of the group
which applies each year to Wash-
ington and Lee from which each

freshman class is made up. Our
alumni can be a great help here as
I will point out later, particularly
in view of the tremendous national
increase in college applications.

Toward this end, it seems to me
we should concentrate more and
more of our efforts on promising
high school students, because they
are harder to contact than are pre-
paratory school students. Also
the preparatory school boy is more
likely to be equipped financially to
attend Washington and Lee than is
the high school student, though
Washington and Lee’s increased
scholarship aid is narrowing the
margin. (See Scholarships, page 9.)

An official of the Washington
and Lee chapter of Phi Beta Kappa
told me this past spring that of
the fifty-odd men who had been
initiated into the society since he
became an officer, only about half
a dozen of them were preparatory
school graduates. Though these
boys may be easier to contact, this
seems to me to indicate that the top
prep schoolers are being drawn off
by the Ivy League schools. As in the
case of high school candidates, per-
sonal contacts through our alumni
would do much towards steering
more of the best preparatory school
students in Washington and Lee’s
direction.

Once the student has been ac-
cepted at Washigton and Lee and
has become a member of the stu-
dent body, the job of keeping his
standards high depends on his at-
titude and the attitude of the rest
of the student body—what we might
call “atmosphere.” This ‘‘atmos-
phere” is created largely by the
students themselves. The time must
come when the student who spends
his evenings in the library or at
some other worthwhile task is re-
spected by the majority of the stu-
dent body and not made the favor-
ite target of campus cynics.

One thing that has troubled me
about this University is that
many students admit—in private—
respect for the individual who
works hard in the face of the many
influences to the contrary, and they

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

 

 

may even attempt emulation. But
very few of these students will ad-
mit such feelings to a group of
their fellows which they think may
be the least bit hostile to such
thinking. We need more men in the
student body who will stand up
for what they believe.

During my four years at Wash-
ington and Lee, I was constantly
struck by the deep love of the older
members of the faculty for Wash-
ington and Lee and that for which
it stands, and by the exuberant en-
thusiasm of the younger members of
the faculty for what the University
can become.

Our faculty is, by and large, a
fine one. The University’s system—
which is similar to that in most
universities—of granting tenure to
all faculty members holding associ-
ate professorships or above, leaves
some who receive tenure with no
stimulus for further achievement or
development. The newly instituted
system of faculty grants-in-aid for
research is providing stimulus in
many cases where internal stimulus
was not enough, though its most tmn-
portant service is in providing the
most intellectually active of our
faculty members with the means to
carry out their projects.

Extensive work has been done
by the faculty members individually
and in time-consuming committee
meetings to improve our curricu-
lum. Comparison of a current cata-
logue with one of four years ago
will show just how much has been
done. ‘There is, of course, more
which can be done. For example, in
this day and age courses in Russian
history and in the culture of India
are “musts” in any college. Wash-
ington and Lee offers no such indi-
vidual courses.

I feel the freshman year can
still stand a great deal of revamp-
ing. The English Department has
done something in this direction,
but other departments should fol-
low suit. It is a bit discouraging—
especially during their first year at
Washington and Lee—for the good
students who graduate from top

OCTOBER 1955

preparatory or high schools to come
here and be required to take cer-
tain freshman courses which are
similar to ones they took in prepar-
atory or high school, but are taught
on an even lower level. In this same
line, I certainly feel the freshman
should have the right to elect at
least one of his courses.

Finally, we come to our alum-
ni—the great reservoir from which
a university should draw its sustain-
ing strength. It always amazes me to
note the lack of interest — both
financial and otherwise — which
many of our alumni seem to have in
the affairs of their alma mater, in
comparison with alumni of other
schools of similar size and nature.
Cy Young has worked constantly
to draw our alumni back into the
University “family” and with the
establishment of Don Smith’s Of-
fice of University Development, ef-
forts in this direction have been re-
doubled.

I think, though, there is a great
deal that our alumni—as individ-
uals—can continue to contribute to
Washington and Lee and this does
not necessarily have to take the
form of financial support. Simply
being alert to the problems of the
University and offering one’s serv-
ices and suggestions where they ap-
ply is an important way our alumni
can help Washington and Lee grow.

Even an occasional note expressing
approval of some praiseworthy act
of the University would be greatly
appreciated by the hardworking
administration and staff.

Alumni can be a_ tremendous
help in interesting the best high
school and preparatory school stu-
dents in Washington and Lee. The
very fact that Washington and Lee’s
graduates are so widespread may
work to our advantage here. If each
man would keep in touch with the
schools in his community, get in
touch with the top boys in the
senior class, interest them in Wash-
ington and Lee, and suggest their
names to Dean Gilliam, we could
easily raise our entrance standards
because this would greatly increase
the number of students who apply
every year for admission to our
freshman class.

So I look upon Washington and
Lee, taking account of its traditions
and its achievements, but emphasiz-
ing its human potential because the
University’s ultimate greatness lies
in the direction of constant growth
and development of its human re-
sources, and not in the direction ot
placid acceptance of past accom-
plishments. Here lies the challenge.
And it is a challenge which each of
us must accept or reject individual-
ly, depending on how strong is our
love for Washington and Lee.

Dickie Moore of ‘Towson, Mary-

John Atwell, of Hampton, Virginia.

The key to the Generals’ suc-
cess this fall appears to be at the
tackle post, according to the
coaches. Chipley was almost pessi-
mistic about this position before
practice started, but the appearance
of junior Ike Smith of Charleston,
West Virginia, and freshman Joe
Cambria of Westfield, New Jersey,
has somewhat eased the situation.

Center is in the capable hands of
senior Dickey Johnson of Gibson
Island, Maryland. Junior Jim May-
oza, a graduate of Louisville’s Male
High, could bolster this position
or take over Johnson’s job, but
as this is written he has not re-
ported for pactice.

Besides Brantley, Coach Williams
is working with a bevy of other up-
and-coming guards. Sophomore
Fred Heina of Louisville and senior
Barb Neblett of Washington are
strong contenders for the position.

End play will be in the hands of
the teams’ sole 1953 letterman,
senior Earl Gillespie of Coeburn,
Virginia. He seems certain to rate
a starting position, but the other
end will be a toss-up among several
less experienced candidates. One
end who will see lots of action is
sophomore Phil Brown, a former
Navy “‘frogman” from Euclid, Ohio.

As for a prediction of the sea-
son’s record, Chipley is reluctant
to put himself out on a limb. Al-
though the schedule is far removed
from the “killer” slates the Gen-
erals played several years ago, Chip-
ley feels it is still plenty rugged for
his inexperienced squad. “Any
schedule would be rough for us this
year,” he says. “It all depends on
how our boys come along under the
coaching we’re giving them.”

HEN WILLIAM H. KEISTER went
W to Harrisonburg, Virginia, in
1894, after four years at Washing-
ton and Lee, he intended staying
there for “just one year only” as
principal of the high school. In
1947, some 53 years later, he he-
tired as superintendent of the Har-
risonburg School System, having
gained state and regional recogni-
tion as a leading figure in public
school education.

On August 25, 1955, a grateful
community took the occasion of Mr.
Keister’s goth birthday to dedicate
the imposing W. H. Keister Ele-
mentary School, Harrisonburg’s
first major addition to its school
facilities in 45 years, as a monu-
ment to the man who made the
city’s educational standards among
the highest in the state. Over 500
persons attended, most of them
former students of Mr. Keister who
came to watch him cut a cake repli-
ca of the new school and to hear
testimonials at the biggest birthday
party in Harrisonburg’s history.

Among messages of congratula-
tions was one from Dr. Francis P.
Gaines in which he noted that Mr.
Keister’s “competence and _his
conscience in his work have enabled
him to write a really significant
chapter in the history of Virginia
education.” That chapter includes
fifteen years as supervisory princi-
pal and thirty-one years as school
superintendent. Because of the pop-
ularity of private schools in the
1890's, his first job was “selling”
the community on public educa-
tion. He did the job and did it so
well that other Virginia educators
have long considered the high
standards of the Harrisonburg
public schools as a model.

18

The new school which honors
him is itself a model elementary
school. It includes eighteen class-
rooms, one special activities room,
and a combination auditorium,
gymnasium and cafeteria. All furn-
ishings are scaled to the size of
the pupils who will use them.

Although his primary work has
been in education, Mr. Keister has
also developed many other inter-
ests, including leadership in com-
munity and church affairs and an
ardent devotion to sports and the
benefits to be derived by young
people from participation in them.

Washington and Lee alumni may
remember his humorous description
of what may have been the first
football contest between the Minks
and Wahoos. Mr. Keister was a
student on the sidelines that day,
and his account of the dusty con-
test, played in a virtual cornfield
near the present site of Wilson
Field, was carried in the Alumni
Magazine several years ago. He

Board of ‘Trustees of Hollins College Cor-
poration in June. He has been associated
with the Richmond law firm of Hunton,
Williams, Gay, Moore & Powell since 1937.

©60000008060600090090000000008000

wrote of how a Virginia player
feigned serious injury on one play
and scampered the length of the
field for a touchdown on the next.
Mr. Keister didn’t recall who won,
but he felt sure “they” did.

‘The next year he was on the team
himself, competing on a well-sodded
but not quite level field near the
site of the old Hotel De Hart. In
one of the games against VMI, he
broke a knuckle on his right hand
which pains him to this day.

He wrote Cy Young shortly after
his retirement in 1947 that he was
thoroughly enjoying his retirement
“among my friends and former
pupils who are kind enough to call
and have an oldtime chat together.”

Of Washington and Lee he had
this to say: “After all the years, I
am eternally grateful for what
Washington and Lee did for me
and has meant to me; it not only
does for you, but does in you that
which is helpful every day of your
life—true, in my case, I know.”

Of the great tribute accorded him
by his townspeople, ‘Dr. Keister,”
as he is called in Harrisonburg, told
his friends he considered the nam-
ing of the school for him as the
greatest honor in his long life.

In the dedication speech, Dr. Wil-
liam R. Smithey, a long-time friend
of Mr. Keister and a professor emer-
itus at the University of Virginia,
voiced Harrisonburg’s feelings:
“Although this school will be
known as the W. H. Keister School,
the people of Harrisonburg do not
need a school building to perpe-
tuate your name. You have been
an institution, an inspiration, and
have been indispensible to the
school system of this community.”

F ANYONE MENTIONS “Lawyer
Vickers” around Fayette Coun-
ty, West Virginia, the likely inter-
jection from a listener is “Which
one?” It could be any one of four
brothers who are currently practic-
ing law there, and the West Vir-
ginia State Bar News believes this
family affair is unique among
American attorneys. American Bar
Association records reveal no other
instance in which four brothers are
practicing law simultaneously, let
alone at the same time and in the
same locality.

‘The new record was established
this spring when George L. Vickers
graduated from West Virginia Uni-
versity’s law school and joined his
three brothers, Arnold M., Carl B.,
and Earl M. Vickers, in Fayette
County where their hometown of
Montgomery is located. Arnold,
Carl, and Earl are all Washington
and Lee law graduates. ;

Arnold, a member of the law
Class of 1931, plunged into public
service soon after he left Lexington.
He was elected to the West Virginia
House of Delegates in 1934 for one
term, and since then has served two

The brothers Vickers: Standing, EARL, 49, and GEORGE; seated, ARNOLD, ’31 and CARL, ’34

terms as state senator and three as
mayor of Montgomery. According
to the Bar News, he is being men-
tioned prominently as a_ possible
candidate for the Democratic nom1-
nation for governor in 1956. While
at Washington and Lee he was initi-
ated into Phi Alpha Delta legal fra-
ternity.

Carl, who also received his B.A.
degree at Washington and Lee,
finished law school in 1934. Dur-
ing undergraduate days he was
president of the sophomore class,
vice-president of the student body,
a member of ODK, an Executive
Committeeman, and a member of
Phi Delta Phi legal fraternity. He
has served four terms as Fayette
County prosecuting attorney and
in 1952 was elected to a six-year
term on the county court. Class-
mates will remember him by the
nickname “Happy.”

Earl was also an Executive Com-
mitteeman and a member of ODK
and Phi Delta Phi. He received his
law degree in 1949 and, as Arnold
and Carl, was a member of Lambda
Chi Alpha social fraternity.
