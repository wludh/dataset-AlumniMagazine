N APRIL, AT LONG LAST, Campus

workers transferred the offices of
eleven University professors into
their quarters in the new $250,000
academic building (see cover). ‘The
transfer was the first major move
on the campus since the McCor-
mick Library was remodeled in
1941. Most of the faculty members
who now occupy offices in the new
building were formerly housed in
the basement of the Library. ‘The
ROTC unit, which also occupied
some of the basement space, has
moved into the offices vacated, and
its former area has been converted
into study rooms.

Departments which share the fa-
cilities of the new building in-
clude Education, Fine Arts, Ger-
man, Greek, Latin, Philosophy,
Psychology, Religion, and some
History. In all, the building has
eight classrooms, eleven offices, a
small auditorium, a large projec-
tion room, and facilities for Fine
Arts. Specifically, those facilities
for Fine Arts include two offices, a
classroom, a studio, and an exhibit
hall, and were made possible large-
ly through the gift of the parents
of a student. Their gift was desig-
nated for that purpose.

m THE TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL con-
vention of the Southern Interscho-
lastic Press Association convened
on the Washington and Lee campus
in late April. On hand for the
affair were some 950 delegates, a
record for the occasion, and an im-
posing array of speakers. The lat-
ter included Milton Caniff, crea-
tor and artist of “Steve Canyon”
and the originator of “Terry and
the Pirates,’ John Scott, assistant
to the publisher of Time and form-
er overseas correspondent for that
publication, and Lawrence E. Wat-
kin, who taught at Washington
and Lee for fifteen years before
joining Walt Disney’s staff as a
screen writer.

graphic experts, college professors,
radio news directors, and typogra-
phy experts helped to conduct a
wide variety of lectures, panel dis-
cussions, and critiques. As usual,
awards were made to outstanding
student newspapers, yearbooks,
magazines, and radio news shows.

At the final banquet C. Harold
Lauck, Director of the Journalism
Laboratory Press, received S.I.P.A.’s
Distinguished Service Award for
“outstanding achievement in_ the
field of scholastic publishing and in
acknowledgement of devoted and
effective service to journalism, to
education, and to youth.”

The citation accompanying the
award noted that “For nearly
twenty-five years C. Harold Lauck
has given devoted service to the
Southern Interscholastic Press As-
sociation. As a member of the staf
and faculty of the Lee Journalism
Foundation, and as superintendent
of the Foundation’s printing labo-
ratory, he has participated in the
planning and the programs of SIPA
and has been responsible for all of
the Association’s printing.

“Those of us who work with him
know what special thought and care
he has always given to SIPA publi-
cations, and the generous dedica-
tion of his talent and energy which
they represent. ‘The results are seen
year after year in the beautiful
SIPA programs, the certificates, and
other publications that bear the
Association’s imprint.

“Of special importance, however,
is Mr. Lauck’s willingness, by exam-
ple, by precept, and by friendly
interest, to share his profound
knowledge of the graphic arts with
young people, with the members of
SIPA as well as with our own stu-
dents, and to help them to an un-
derstanding of craftsmanship and
an appreciation of good taste.”

B DR. GEORGE HUTCHESON DENNY,
president of Washington and Lee
from igo1 until 1911, died in the
Jackson Memorial Hospital in Lex-
ington on April 2, 1955. He and
his family had returned to Lexing-
ton in 1937, following a quarter

JUNE 1955

century of service as President of
the University of Alabama, to live
in the beautiful home they built
on the outskirts of town.

A native of Hanover County,
Virginia, Dr. Denny was graduated
from Hampden-Sydney College in
1891 and received his master’s and
doctor’s degrees from the Univer-
sity of Virginia. He taught at Pan-
tops Academy in Charlottesville
and was professor of Latin and Ger-
man at Hampden-Sydney before
coming to Washington and Lee in
1899 as professor of Latin. He was
elevated to the presidency in 1901
when he was only 32 years old.

During his administration in Lex-
ington the enrollment of the Uni-
versity was increased appreciably,
the physical plant grew from year
to year, and in many respects the
whole institution assumed a new ap-
pearance. At the same time his
marvelous faculty for remembering
the personality and background of
every student with whom he came
in contact made him innumerable
friends with each succeeding year
of service.

In 1912 the University of Alaba-
ma, then a small institution, in-
vited him to become its president.
Washington and Lee regretted los-
ing him and a student mass meet-
ing protested his leaving. But the
invitation presented a challenging
opportunity, and he accepted it.
He served there from 1912 until
1937 when he became chancellor.
Five years later he was recalled to
Alabama as president; and he was
again named chancellor the fol-
lowing year.

During his full career, Dr. Denny
served as president of both the Na-
tional Association of State Univer-
sities and the Southern Associa-
tion of Colleges and Preparatory
Schools. He was a Trustee of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Ad-
vancement of Teaching, chairman
of the Rhodes Scholarship Com-
mittee for Alabama from 1912 until
1937, and during 1944 and 1945,
chairman of the Virginia Educa-
tion Commission.

His honorary societies included
Phi Beta Kappa, for which he was
a senator for the united chapters,
Omicron Delta Kappa, and the
Newcomen Society of England.

Apart from his direct Services
to education, Dr. Denny served as
a member of the College of Electors
of the Hall of Fame for a number
of years. He was head of the cotton-
seed industry division of the United
States Food Administration in 1917-
18, and was appointed by President
Hoover as a member of the national
commission to study the relations
of the Federal Government to edu-
cation. In 1925 he was named by
popular vote “the most distinguish-
ed professional leader of Alabama”
and in 1946 was acclaimed first
citizen of Alabama at a ceremony
in Birmingham.

Dr. Denny was married to Miss
Jane Strickler, daughter of Dr.
Givens Strickler, °67, then of the
faculty of Union Theological Sem-
inary in Richmond and Rector of
the Board of ‘Trustees at Washing-
ton and Lee. She survives him, as do
two daughters, Miss Frances Denny
and Mrs. O. Hunter McClung, both
of Lexington; two sisters, Miss
Mattie Denny of Harrisonburg and
Miss Otelia Denny of Amelia; and
a brother, Robert Denny, ’10, of
Nicholasville, Kentucky.

H WASHINGTON AND LEE was one of
three Virginia colleges to be hon-
ored in Los Angeles in May when
the Westwood Hills Christian
Church dedicated its University
Window. Twelve by fourteen feet
in size, three years in preparation,
and valued at $15,000, the Univer-
sity Window consists of the coats of
arms of ninety-six colleges and unt-
versities throughout the world, set
in stained glass. |

“The arrangement of the ninety-
six coats of arms, in eighteen panels,
beginning with the first European
university at Salerno,’ writes Dr.
Jesse Randolph Kellems, pastor of
the Church, “makes possible the
tracing of the ancestry of the col-
leges and universities from the var-

 

 

ious denominations by which they
were established.”

Washington and Lee and Wil-
liam and Mary are among ten
American institutions founded dur-
ing the Colonial period whose crests
appear in the window. They are
located in a panel with the heraldry
of the University of Pennsylvania,
Columbia University, the Univer-
sity of the South, and Johns Hop-
kins University. The University
of Virginia is included in a second
group of thirty-two American col-
leges founded later.

Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul, pres-
ident of the University of Califor-
nia, delivered the principal address
at the dedication of the window.
Representatives of all ninety-six
colleges and universities marched
in the academic procession for the
occasion. Among them was Thomas
Ball, ’03, a San Marino, California,
attorney, who represented Washing-
ton and Lee.

ONCE AGAIN THE TREE-SHADED Cam-
pus in front of the President’s home
was the site of the Commencement
exercises which brought to a close
the go6th college year. One hun-
dred eighty seniors received their

The close of the 206th year

bachelor’s degrees in laws, science,
and arts from Dr. Gaines and heard
him, as is tradition, deliver the
Commencement address and confer
the degrees. Charles Henry Nowlin
of Wilmington, Delaware, was vale-
dictorian for the Class of 1955.
Necessarily unpublicized in ad-
vance of the exercises was the sur-
prise presentation to Dr. Lucius
Junius Desha, made by Dr. Gaines
in behalf of the Board of Trustees,
of a scroll honoring his long ser-
vice to the University. ‘“Washing-
ton and Lee University,” the cita-
tion read, “in gratitude for his 35
years of inspired teaching, his wise
counsel, his generous participation
in the life of the University, his
noble influence upon many gener-
ations of students and alumni, ex-
presses its appreciation to Lucius
Junius Desha, accords to him the
rank of professor emeritus, and ad-
mits him to all the rights and
privileges of that position. In tok-
en whereof we have affixed our sig-
natures and the seal of the Univer-
sity, this third day of June, 1955.”

= A PORTRAIT OF William Graham
was presented to the University in
April by Thomas R. Watkins, presi-

dent of the Peninsula Chapter of
the Washington and Lee Alumni
Association. The portrait was paint-
ed by Mrs. Agnes McMurran John-
son of Newport News, the sister of
four Washington and Lee alumni,
George K., ’41, John M., °44, Rich-
ard E., ’51, and Lewis A. McMur-
ran, Jr., °36, all of the Peninsula
area. The Reverend Graham. be-
came the first president of what is
now Washington and Lee in 1782
when Liberty Hall Academy was
incorporated by the Virginia Leg-
islature and empowered to grant
degrees. He served until 1796.

AT THE ANNUAL MEETING of the
Virginia State Printers Association
in Richmond in February, Wash-
ington and Lee’s Journalism Labo-
ratory Press, directed by C. Harold
Lauck, received the August An-
drew Dietz, Jr.. Memorial Award,
a bronze plaque, for its publica.
tion of the Washington and Lee
Alumni Magazine. ‘The magazine
was Classified as the best printing
of the year by a small printing
house in Virginia. The Associa-
tion’s awards system divides all
shops into one of three classes—

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

m A PLANETARIUM, purchased by
General Robert E. Lee, now stands
almost forgotten in the attic of
Reid Hall. When General Lee pur-
chased the room-size scale model
in 1868, it was the latest thing for
the study of astronomy. Projection-
type planetariums have since super-
ceded it, however, with the result
that today this complex mechanism
is a museum piece.

All the same, as Dr. Robert W.
Dickey, head of the physics depart-
ment points out, this scale model
illustrates some things which _to-
day’s planetariums cannot. It in-
dicates, for example, the relative
positions, movements, speeds, and
inclinations of the three planets
closest to the Sun and the Earth’s
moon. In contrast, today’s plane-
tariums can show only how these
various bodies appear in the sky.
For this reason General Lee’s pur-
chase was overhauled and put in
good working condition in 1951,
and is used occasionally by students
studying astronomy during the al-
ternate years in which it is taught.

Back in June 1867, General Lee
told his Board of Trustees that “a
planetarium which would be very
serviceable in teaching the course
of astronomy next year has been
offered to the College by the inven-
tor, Professor Barlow, at halt
cost.... Contributions have been
made in Kentucky to aid in (the)
purchase which will reduce the
cost to the College to between $400
and $500. I therefore recommend
(the) purchase.”

A year later he reported to his
Board that the planetarium was of
“great service to the professor in
his instruction and (had) lightened
the labour of his scholars.”

Thirty-one gears operate the
Washington and Lee planetarium
and carry the earth in a 4o-foot
orbit around the sun at the same
time as they move the moon, Mer-
cury, and Venus in their respective
orbits. Most of this intricate mech-
anism operates the Earth, govern-
ing its daily rotation and its ever-
changing tilt on its axis, while

JUNE 1955

seven other gears control the move-
ment of the small moon.

The outer rim of the planetarium
is divided into twelve months of
the year. Thus it can be moved to
show the earth’s inclination, which
determines the season, at any time
of the year.

Mercury and Venus are small
balls, swinging around the Sun at
their relative speeds. The plane of
the Earth and Sun remains cons-
tant, with the two planets sweeping
above and below this plane in their
relative deviation as they make
their trips around the Sun.

According to Dr. Dickey, only
three or four planetariums of its
kind were made by Professor Bar-
low. A sister model is now located
at the University of Mississippi, but
the whereabout of the one or two
other models are not known.

m EDITORS AND EDITORIAL WRITERS of
Virginia newspapers gathered at
Washington and Lee in late March
for the fourth Virginia Editorial
Writer’s Seminar. Over fifty repre-
sentatives from daily and weekly
newspapers in the state took part in
the program, which is held every
other year under the sponsorship
of the Virginia Press Association in
cooperation with the Lee Memorial
Journalism Foundation. Program
principals included Shenandoah
Valley publisher Harry F. Byrd, Jr.;
C. Stuart Wheatley, attorney for
the Danville newspapers; Creed
Black of the Nashville Tennessean;

J. L. Wiggins of the Hartsville,
South Carolina, Messenger; Dr.
Nicholas P. Mitchell of the Green-
ville, South Carolina, News-Critic;
and C. A. McKnight, director of
the Southern Education Reporting
Service of Nashville.

mg “WHEN THE SUPREME CourRT hand-
ed down its steel seizure decision,”
editorialized the Indianapolis News
of June 6, 1952, “the occasion
marked the passing of an era in the
American bar. It was undoubtedly
the last case, and of course, the most
historic, to be argued by John W.
Davis.... And Davis is the last of
that triad of great lawyers, of whom
the others were Charles Evans
Hughes and Newton D. Baker, who
for a generatoion presided over
the American bar and gave it a dig-
nity unsurpassed in any earlier per-
iod of the profession.

“Many commented with gratifi-
cation that John W. Davis had had
an opportunity to appear in the
sunset of his years, in a case that
must inevitably remain a landmark
in defining the limits of executive
power. His arguments likely will be
examined as long as this constitu-
tional republic endures. Neither
Hughes nor Baker, outstanding as
were their abilities, had this chance.

“There was a_ striking coinci-
dence in the education of two of
these three great lawyers. John W.

Davis and Newton D. Baker were
products of the Washington and
Lee Law School. Nothing in its ar-
chitecture or setting ever proved
such ornaments to. this. small
school.”

Such was the distinction that
John W. Davis, A.B. ‘92, LL.B. ‘95,
brought to himself and to his alma
mater. On March 24, 1955, at the
age of 81, he succumbed to his third
attack of pneumonia during the
past winter. At the time he was at
Yeaman’s Hall, a resort colony near

Charleston, South Carolina.

Born in Clarksburg, West Vir-
ginia, on April 13, 1873, John W.
Davis was of Scotch, English, and
Irish stock. His paternal ancestors
included some of the earliest Vir-
ginia settlers. He received his early
education in private schools, en-
tered Washington and Lee at the
age of 16, and graduated with the
A.B. degree at 19. After teaching
school for a short time he reentered
the Law School at the University
and graduated with the LL.B. de-
gree in 1895.

From that time on he was to
spend a year in practice in Clarks-
burg, a year as an assistant professor
at the University’s Law School, and
then move on to a long and distin-
guished legal career. In the course
of that career he became president
of both the West Virginia Bar As-
sociation (at the age of 33) and the
American Bar Association. He also
represented many corporations be-
fore the United States Supreme
Court, one of his last appearances
being in behalf of the State of
South Carolina in the public school
segregation case in 1954.

Nor did John W. Davis devote
himself exclusively to the practice
of law. He served one term in the
West Virginia House of Delegates
and two terms in Congress. He was
a delegate to the Democratic Na-
tional Convention in 1904 and
again in 1932, and in 1924 was the
party’s Presidential nominee.

In 1913 he was appointed Solici-
tor General by President Woodrow
Wilson, an office he held until 1918,

DAVIS

when he was appointed United
States Ambassador to Great Britain.
He served in this most important
diplomatic post until 1921. Three
decades later, on April 12, 1953,
Queen Elizabeth II appointed him
an Honorary Knight Grand Cross
of the Most Excellent Order of the
British Empire. The decoration 1s
the highest rank of the order, and
the highest civilian distinction the
Queen can bestow on a United
States citizen.

In addition to this honor, and
to those bestowed upon him by
many universities in this country,
Mr. Davis also received honorary
degrees from the University of
Birmingham (England), the Uni-
versity of Glasgow, and Oxford
University.

He became a member of Wash-
ington and Lee’s Board of ‘Trustees
in 1921 and continued in that ca-
pacity until 1949 when he was
named Trustee Emeritus. In his
estate he remembered his

Mr. Davis was married in 1899 to
Miss Julia McDonald. ‘Their daugh-
ter, Julia, (Mrs. Charles P. Healey),
survives him. Mrs. Davis died in
igco. In 1912 he married Miss Ellen
G. Bissell, who died in 1943.

Shortly before Commencement,
the University received from Mrs.
Healey a fine oil portrait of her
father. That portrait of John W.
Davis will hang with portraits of
other distinguished members of the
Washington and Lee family in
Washington Hall.

DEVELOPMENT

TWENTY-FIVE MEMBERS of the Par-
ents’ Advisory Council came to the
campus on April 23 for the initial
meeting of their group. They came
from Montana, ‘Texas, Louisiana,
Florida—in all, from eleven states
and the District of Columbia.
Twelve brought their wives. ‘Chey
joined with University officials for
morning and afternoon meetings to
discuss ways and means through
which the University can be of
ereater service to parents and
through which the organized el-
forts of parents can be useful in
promoting the welfare of Washing-
ton and Lee.

Since alumni who have sons at
the University maintain their ties
with Washington and Lee through
the Alumni Association, the Advis-
ory Council’s membership is made
up of non-alumni parents. It was
pertinent, therefore, that they
should hear about the University in
some detail from its administrative
officials, and have an opportunity
to meet and talk with numerous
members of the faculty. ‘That is
exactly what took place.

During the morning _ session
President Gaines, Deans James G.
Leyburn and Frank J. Gilliam, and
Director of Development Donald
E. Smith discussed with the group
the functions of their respective ad-
ministrative positions. At luncheon
and during the coffee and dessert
at the President’s Home which fol-
lowed, there was further opportu-
nity for discussion with administra-
tive and faculty personnel.

Members of the Advisory Council
had an opportunity, also, to dis-
cuss matters that were on their
minds. They were particularly con-
cerned with the University’s in-

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

formation - to - parents’ program—
with the Newsletter that they have
been receiving and with the possi-
bility and desirability of their re-
ceiving other publications from
time to time. They discussed mat-
ters concerned with the progress
of their sons, and with the sons of
other parents. They talked of the
possibility of parents attending
alumni chapter meetings, but con-
cluded that while many would like
to do so, the initiative with regard
to inviting them should remain
with the alumni chapters.

During the course of these meet-
ings, four specific functions were
suggested to the Council as ways
it, or its members, could render
important service to the University.
They were: (1) as a forum for an
active interchange of ideas between
parents and University officials, (2)
as an organization wherein plans
can be formulated, and through
which they can be administered, to
bring the parents of all students
into a closer association with and
understanding of the University, (3)
as individual “ambassadors” of
Washington and Lee within their
own communities and within the
realm of their personal contacts
elsewhere, and (4) as a significant
force in the University’s Develop-
ment Program, specifically by (a)
representation on the University
Development Council, (b) making
or suggesting such helpful contacts
as it may be within their province
to do, (c) furnishing information
that will be helpful and valuable to
the Development Office’s continu-
ing program of research, and (d) as-
sisting with such programs of group
or individual giving as the Coun-
cil may deem prudent.

For a major part of these meet-
ings, Maxwell Caskie, Jr., assistant
vice-president of the Reynolds Met-
als Company of Washington, D. C.,
served as chairman pro tem. One of
his first official acts was to appoint
a nominating committee and to
direct that committee to present
nominations for the chairmanship
of the Council and for the position

JUNE 1955

as representative on the University
Development Council. At the af-
ternoon session the committee rec-
ommended that there be co-chair-
men of the Council, and that they
be Christian C. Luhnow, publisher
and editor of Trusts and Estates of
New York City and Gordonsville,
Virginia, and John E. Larson, an
attorney, of Washington, D.C. Mr.
Caskie was nominated to. the
University Development Council
Their election was unanimous.

The Council’s co-chairmen set
to work immediately. ‘They suggest-
ed that there be discussion with re-
gard to the possibility of a Parent's
Day, at which time the parents of
all students would be urged to visit
the campus and see it in action.
Such a day was scheduled tenta-
tively for November 19, 1955.

Looking to the further develop-
ment of plans for that gathering,
and to developing also a statement
of philosophy and _ specific plans
for carrying on constructive work

in others areas where the Council

can be of assistance, Messrs. Larson,
Luhnow, Caskie, and Smith met for
a lengthy discussion in mid-June.
Matters which they discussed will
be circulated to members of the Ad-

visory Council during the summer,
and will become topics for further
discussion at the next meeting of
the Council which is tentatively
scheduled for November 18, the day
preceding Parents’ Day. It is being
planned, also, that the deliberations
of the Council will be discussed ful-
ly at an open meeting of all par-
ents on the following day.

FACULTY

& STAFF CHANGES INVOLVING twenty-
one faculty members have been an-
nounced by Dean James G. Ley-
burn. They include four new ap-

sociate professor of physical educa-
tion; Charles J. Herbert, William
T. McCann, and Richard Miller as
assistant professors of physical edu-
cation; and Delbert A. Davis as
instructor in physical education.

The physical education depart-
ment promotions involve coaches
and trainers who now hold faculty
status under the University’s new
integrated athletic program.

Dr. Gilreath replaces Dr. Lucius

Junius Desha as head of the chem-
istry department. Dr. Desha was
appointed Professor Emeritus of
Chemistry by the University Board
of Trustees at the June meeting.
‘Two faculty members will return
from leaves of absence in Septem-
ber, and one will take leave for
research work. Returning are Dr.
William A. Jenks, associate pro-
fessor of history, and G. Francis
Drake, assistant professor of ro-
mance languages. B. Stuart Steph-
enson, assistant professor of Ger-
man, will study next year at the
University of Minnesota under a
Danforth Foundation grant.

m WASHINGTON AND LEE’s director of
religious activities, Dr. David W.
Sprunt, will be among a group of
twelve religious studies professors
from American colleges who will
study this summer at the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem. The six-
week course he will pursue will be
in the form of a graduate seminar,
with half of the period being de-
voted to lectures and the other half
to field trips to historic sites. Funds
for this sojourn in the Holy Land
are being administered through the
department of Hebrew of New
York University.

Dr. Sprunt and others in his
party will fly to Israel in July and

return in early September. While
there he will represent Washing-
ton and Lee at the dedication of
Bar-Ilan University, founded by
Americans at Ramat Gan, near
Tel Aviv.

m IN APRIL, Professor O. W. Riegel,
director of the Lee Memorial Jour-
nalism Foundation, took part in
the program of the 25th Anniver-
sary Institute for Education by Ra-
dio-Television as a member of a
discussion group for the topic
“Maintaining Cultural Levels on
the Air.” In the same group were
Edward Stanley, public service man-
ager for the National Broadcasting
Company; E. W. Stirton, executive
secretary of the Detroit Education-
al Television Foundation; and Har-
ry Skornia, executive director ot
the National Association of Educa-
tional Broadcasters. ‘The Institute
was held in Columbus, Ohio, under
the auspices of Ohio State.

m PROFESSOR CHARLES R. MC DOWELL
of the Law School journeyed back
to Centre College in June to re-
ceive the accolade of his alma mater
in the form of an honorary Doctor
of Laws degree. ‘The citation for the
degree noted that he was born in
Danville, went to school and college
in Danville, as did his father and
two brothers before him, and that
his mother was in the audience.
“Through these family ties and per-
sonal experience,” it continued, “‘he
acquired the rich knowledge of his
birthplace which enabled him to
write that book which has delighted
so many, “The Iron Baby Angel,’
published a year ago. ‘Though
Charles McDowell has studied at
Columbia University and Yale Law
School, practiced law in Danville,
Kentucky, and Palm Beach, Flor-
ida, and is now a member of the law
faculty of Washington and Lee
University where he has been since
1927, and though he has acquired
many honors along life’s way, he
still regards as his proudest achieve-
ment his year as coach of the Centre
College basketball team which beat

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

the University of Kentucky for the
State Championship in 1921. It
gives me real personal pleasure, Mr.
President, to present an old friend
and loyal son of Old Centre for
the honorary degree of Doctor of
Laws.”

As he conferred the degree, Cen-
tre’s president, Walter A. Groves,
said, “I know that there are many
memories of other commencements
at Centre, commencements which
you witnessed as a boy, later as a
student, still later as a young mem-
ber of Centre’s faculty, and across
the years as an alumnus, which
come to your mind. We, your
friends of the Board of ‘Trustees,
alumni and alumnae of the college,
and a host of others gathered here,
want to add another pleasant mem-
ory in this tribute to you for your
fine job as a student and teacher.”

DR. L. L. BARRETT, professor of
Spanish, addressed the annual meet-
ing of the Modern Foreign Lan-
guage Association of Virginia in
April on the subject, “Languages
and Intercultural Understanding.”
Dr. Barrett also continues his work
as a member of the Committee of
Spanish Examiners of the College
Entrance Examination Board.

m THE PROBLEMS OF A Virginia plan-
tation owner during the post-Civil
War period were brought sharply
into focus by Dr. Charles ‘Turner,
associate professor of history, in an
article in the spring issue of the
Virginia Journal of History and
Biography. His article, “The Diary
of Wilham J. Hart, 1871-73,” con-
sists largely of excerpts from the
actual journal kept by Hart on
his Louisa County estate. Hart
had been a captain in the Confed-
erate Army, and had returned to
his home to deal with a labor short-
age and with other crises of the
postwar period.

DR. MARCELLUS H. STOW, professor
of geology, is known to keep a pret-
ty close check on radioactivity in
the air around Lexington. In a

JUNE 1955

paper prepared for presentation at
the Virginia Academy of Science
meeting in May, he reported that
things got relatively hot a year ago,
at which time he recorded a read-
ing of sixteen times the normal ra-
diation. That was on May 14, 1954.

He pointed out that “fall-out”
was the probable cause of the ra-
diation, but that he had been un-
able to link it closely with any spe-
cific Atomic Energy Commission
tests that usually are responsible for
higher radiation readings in many
sectors. He went on to explain that
it is possible for radioactive par-
ticles to be carried around the earth
in the atmosphere several times be-
fore the right set of atmospheric
conditions result in a fall-out. ‘The
weather on that day, he reported,
was ideal for it—warm and muggy
with a heavy rain all day.

Stow was quick to assure laymen
that the radiation noted was not in
the least dangerous, and also that
he had cleared his paper through
the Atomic Energy Commission be-
fore submitting it to the science
meeting. His recordings were made
on a scintillatien counter, a sort of
extra-sensitive geiger counter.

His paper was one of five pre-

sented by Washington and Lee pro-
fessors and students at this year’s
Academy of Science sessions. Dr.
Troy J. Laswell, associate professor
of geology, spoke on “A Virginia
Occurence of Paligorskite.” “This
mineral, discovered in 1862 in the
Ural Mountain region of Russia,
was unknown in Virginia until
Laswell discovered a specimen near
Glasgow. Student papers dealt with
mineralogical studies of sediments
from the Eastern Shore peninsula,
New River, and Banister River.

LAW SCHOOL

m TWO MID-TERM LAW. graduates
from Charleston, West Virginia,
have gone their separate ways now,
William R. Cogar to a Richmond
law firm and John F. Kay to a pri-
vate practice in Waynesboro. But
it will be a long time before folks
around Washington and _ Lee’s
Tucker Hall stop talking about the
way their academic careers paral-
leled each other. |

Besides being from the same
home town and the same age, 26,
Kay and Cogar started and- com-
pleted their A.B. degrees at Wash-

 

During the Tucker Lecture weekend, this portrait of WILLIAM H. MoreLanp, late Dean of
the School of Law, was presented to the University by members of his family. Present at
the ceremony were (left to right) DR. GAINES, Mrs. MorELAND, WILLIAM H. MoreLanp, III,
WILLIAM H. MORELAND, JR., and DEAN CLAYTON E. WILLIAMS, Dr. Moreland’s successor.

ington and Lee at the same time.
It was not until they entered upon
the study of law, however, that
their records really began to look
like carbon copies.

Both had their college careers
interrupted by Korean war service.
‘They left school at the same time,
received second lieutenant’s com-
missions in the Marines, served the
same length of time, and returned
to the law volumes on the same day.
‘They found themselves taking the
same courses, working together on
the Law Review, joining the same
legal fraternity.

Lifelong friends, there naturally
sprang up a friendly rivalry be-
tween them. Cogar would do better
in Torts than Kay, but Kay would
beat Cogar in Contracts. But when
the smoke had cleared and _ the
averages were computed, Kay had
outpointed Cogar, not by a tenth
of a point, nor by a hundredth of
a point, but by a mere one-thou-
sandth of a point. Kay’s 83.088 av-
erage and Cogar’s 83.087 were both

good “A’s” at the Law School.

Dean Clayton Williams and his
secretary, Mrs. Catherine McDow-
ell, recall how, after the boys real-
ized how close a race it would be,
they would go to extremes to make
sure neither had any advantage.

“One day after we posted class
and exam schedules,” recounts
Dean Wilhams, “Cogar came tear-
ing into the office demanding to
Juggle his classes. Seems Kay was
going to have an extra day to study
for ‘Trusts when exams rolled
around, unless Cogar could substi-
tute one course for another.”

“He nearly had a fit,’”’ adds Mrs.
McDowell, “until we finally con-
vinced him nothing could be done.”

At one time it looked like Kay
had stolen a march on Cogar when
he was named editor of the Law
Review, while Cogar remained only
a contributor, which in itself is
quite an honor. Cogar was elected
president of the Student Bar Asso-
ciation, however, and everyone feels
one offset the other.

Until this fall, Cogar was a

10

member of Omicron Delta Kappa,
national leadership fraternity, and
Kay was not. When Kay was tap-
ped, another parallel was estab-
lished. And finally, just to top it
off, both were elected to member-
ship in Phi Beta Kappa.

Only in domestic life was there
a really pronounced difference be-
tween the two. Cogar is married
and the father of two children,
while Kay is merely engaged. Folks
at Tucker Hall are just biding
their time until this little difference
is eliminated, also.

mE FOUR SENIOR LAW STUDENTS and an
alumnus have been elected to mem-

 

bership in the Order of the Coif,
the law equivalent of Phi Beta
Kappa. Student members are Wil-
liam M. Bailey of Wilmington,
Ohio; William B. Poff of Vickers,
Virginia; and William R. Cogar
and John F. Kay, both of Charles-
ton, West Virginia.

‘The alumnus chosen for member-
ship in this society is Edward S.
Graves of Lynchburg. Graves grad-
uated from Washington and Lee in
1930 and subsequently received his
law degree at Harvard. He current-
ly is serving as a guest lecturer in
legal draftsmanship, in which ca-
pacity he returns to the campus
weekly.

The Tucker Lecturer for 1955 was the HONORABLE ROBERT C. STOREY, Dean of the School
of Law at Southern Methodist University, here flanked by CLAYTON E. WILLIAMS, Dean
of Washington and Lee’s School of Law, and Dr. Francis P. GAINES, University President.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

gs HAVING HEARD PERSONAL injury
cases discussed from the plaintiff
attorney's viewpoint by Melvin
M. Belli (Alumni Magazine, March
1955), law students heard the de-
fense side of the picture when the
President of the International As-
sociation of Insurance Counsel,
Stanley C. Morris, Sr., of Charles-
ton, West Virginia, addressed the
Student Bar Association in April.
His topic: “Is the Defense Ready?”
The Student Bar Association spon-
sored his talk as part of a program
aimed at bringing outstanding at-
torneys from various fields before
its members.

LIBRARY

= OVER FIVE HUNDRED BOOKS and
pamphlets belonging to the late
Dr. Douglas Southall Freeman have
been donated to the McCormick
Library by the widow of the noted
Southern editor and historian. The
volumes, which Mrs. Freeman said
would be of particular interest to
Washington and Lee, deal almost
entirely with the Civil War pe-
riod, its battles and leaders, and
with General Robert E. Lee.

Valued at more than $2,000, the
collection includes 412 books, 150
pamphlets, and miscellaneous 1s-
sues of various historical magazines.
According to Dr. William G. Bean,
professor of history and an authori-
ty on Civil War history, the books
represent “a good working library
for what Dr. Freeman did.” More-
over, the gift includes many books
now out of print or difficult to ob-
tain, including a complete set of
the “Confederate Veteran,” a peri-
odical published from around 1890
to the early 1930's.

The Freeman gift is the largest of
several recent donations enriching
the Southern history section of the
Library. Jason B. Sewell, Jr., a
member of the Class of 1954 from
Dallas, recently made a substantial
eift for use in purchase of histories
relating to the South and early
West, and the local chapter of Kap-
pa Sigma fraternity has made a

JUNE 1955

gift of Southern history books in
memory of a former member, Rob-
ert Dodd Horn, of Pelham Man-
or, New York, who was killed in the
Korean conflict.

R.OVT.C.

m= WASHINGTON AND LEE’S ROTC
unit climaxed its first complete
four-year training cycle a few weeks
before Commencement with the
year’s final battalion review and the
awarding of medals and citations to
forty-four outstanding cadets. It
was President’s Day, and Dr. Gaines
reviewed the Corps.

For Lt. Col. Richard W. Jones,
Jr., it had a special significance, for
it marked the final review of the
Corps under his leadership as pro-
fessor of military science and tac-
tics. After having been with the
Washington and Lee unit since its
installation in 1951, he is soon to
be detached and to embark upon
a tour of overseas duty.

In recognition of his fine service
to Washington and Lee through his
leadership of the ROTC unit, the
Faculty of the University recorded
its appreciation in the minutes of
its final meeting of the year. And,
in token of their appreciation after
having received their degrees and
their commissions as second lieu-
tenants on Commencement morn-
ing, seventy-six senior ROTC ca-
dets presented Col. Jones with a
silver serving tray. They accom-
panied it with a very official looking
letter setting forth their thanks for
his four years of leadership and
guidance. The letter bore the names
of each member of the senior muli-
tary group, and was signed by Ca-
det Lt. Col. Lowell D. Hamric of
Lexington, battalion commander.

m MAJOR JOHN P. BODKIN took up his
duties at Washington and Lee in
April as associate professor of mil-
tary science and tactics and exec-
utive officer of the ROTC detach-
ment. His previous assignment was
as commanding officer of the 509th
AAA Operations Detachment in
Weisbaden, Germany. A graduate

of the University of Pittsburgh, he
served four years during World
War II and was recalled to duty.

g WITH THE GRADUATION of Robert
E. Bradford of Blacksburg, Vir-
ginia, the Gaines Guard, named in
honor of Washington and Lee’s
President,
elect a new commanding officer.
The selection went to Theodore M.
Kerr from Midland, Texas. This
crack drill component, while not
an official unit of the ROTC bat-
talion, has recently been extended
full recognition as a University
function by the Faculty. Army offi-
cials encourage membership by
qualified cadets and award drill
credit for participation. The Guard
has marched in numerous state pa-
rades and served as Honor Guard
at the inauguration of Governor
Thomas B. Stanley. Plans for next
year include half-time drills at
home football games.

found it necessary to

m EVEN MILITARY UNITS can lose
their dignity at times. On this par-
ticular occasion the entire battalion
was decked out in its inspection
finery. Corps officers were trooping
the line. The recorded lilting
strains of a martial waltz came
over the Wilson Field public ad-
dress system to complete the set-
ting. Suddenly the whistle blared
and the band switched to a lively
rag-time tune. While the troops
euffawed, flabbergasted _ officers
dashed to change the record. On
closer inspection of the label,
ROTC officers wished they had
tested more than only a few bars
of the recording before using it.
The next day Lexington disk jock-
ey Bob Bradford, a senior ROTC
student, let others in on the joke
when he played the record on his
morning radio show.

SCHOLARSHIPS

m IN AN ACTION OF great significance
to Washington and Lee and to po-
tential members of its student body
who need and want scholarship as-

1]

 

 

sistance, the University’s Board of
Trustees, at its meeting in June,
established thirty new scholarships
in memory of Letitia Pate Evans.
‘These scholarships will be financed
by a portion of the income that will
accrue to the University annually
from its share in Mrs. Evans’ estate.

Ten of these scholarships will
be valued at $1,250 each and will
be renewable for each of the four
years a recipient is in attendance,
thus bringing their value to $5,000
for the four-year period. They will
be the largest ever offered by Wash-
ington and Lee University. The
other twenty awards are valued at
$650 per year or $2,600 for the four-
year period.

Candidates for Letitia Pate Evans
Scholarships will be judged on the
basis of character, promise of col-
legiate success, and relative need.
No geographical or other restric-
tions have been placed on the
award of these scholarships.

Mrs. Evans, whose memory the
scholarships honor, died on No-
vember 14, 1953. In her will she
provided that Washington and Lee
receive fifteen per cent of the
income from the residual of her
estate which was placed in trust.
While the exact amount which the
University will receive is not yet
known, the gift is definitely among

 

the largest in the University’s two-
hundred-six-year history.

The Board’s action in setting up
these scholarships was particularly
timely in view of the recommen-
dations of Development committees
for an additional $2,000,000 in en-
dowment for undergraduate schol-
arship awards. ‘The Evans Scholar-
ships, plus the duPont-Gaines
Scholarships, which were establish-
eda year ago, reduce this $2,000,000
figure to about $1,250,000.

A YEAR AGO THE Alumni Magazine
noted that each year since the in-
ception of the Fulbright Scholar-
ship program in 1949, at least one
Washington and Lee student had
received an award for study in a
foreign country. The magazine
went on to announce that three
undergraduates and one member
of the faculty were recipients of
Fulbright Scholarships for study
during the 1954-55 academic year.

Small wonder, therefore, that
University officials—to say nothing
of the young men concerned—were
elated to learn that three members
of the Class of 1955 and three alum-
ni, a total of six in all, had been
awarded Fulbright grants for study
during the 1955-56 academic year.

‘Those selected from the Class of
1955 were Gerard W. Fee of Shelby,
Ohio, Raymond D. Smith, Jr., of

New York City, and William D.
Goode, Jr., of Newport News. Fee
will study English political institu-
tions at Oxford University; Smith
will study humanities at the Univer-
sity of Rennes, France; Goode will
continue his work in physical chem-
istry at Rennish Frederick William
University in Baunn, Germany.

In passing, it should be noted
that Smith is the son of Raymond
D. Smith of the Class of 1922 and
the grandson of Henry Louis Smith,
President of Washington and Lee
from 1912 to 1929. This young man
was also the recipient of the 1955
Washington Award, presented by
the Washington Literary Society to
the student rendering the most dis-
tinctive service to the University.

Alumni recipients of Fulbright
awards this year were Edwin M.
Gaines, ’50; David D. Bien, ’51; and
J. William Stewart, LL.B. ’5e.
Gaines, the son of President and
Mrs. Gaines, will go to the Uni-
versity of London for a year’s study
on Anglo-American relations lead-
ing up to the War of 1812. He has
been doing graduate work in Amer-
ican history at the University of
Virginia, and expects to receive his
doctorate there in August 1956.

Bien, whose home is in Baltimore
and who has been studying at Har-
vard, will go to Toulouse, France,
for a year of research work, while
Stewart, a resident of Washington,
will go to England to do research
on the personal liberties of the
English citizen as compared with
those of the American citizen.

The addition of these six men
to the Fulbright ranks brings to
sixteen the number of Washington
and Lee graduates whose academic
records and promise have made
them beneficiaries of this program.
In addition, two other graduates
in years past found it necessary to
decline awards that had been made
to them.

“” THREE WASHINGTON AND LEE grad-
uates of the Class of 1955 have
been awarded grants for graduate
study at Harvard and at the Uni-
versity of Illinois. Charles H.
Nowhn, of Wilmington, Delaware,
valedictorian of this year’s class,
received a $2,100 scholarship for
study in applied physics at Har-
vard’s Division of Applied Science.
He will work toward his doctorate
in electronics. Lowell D. Hamric,
a commerce major, has been award-
ed a fellowship in economics for
study at Illinois during the 1955-56
session, and Roy C. Herndon of
Washington, D.C., received a teach-
ing fellowship, also at [llinois, in
the amount of $1,500 plus tuition
costs. He will work toward his doc-
torate in nuclear physics.

UNDERGRADUATES

TWELVE STUDENTS and one alum-
nus were initiated into Phi Beta
Kappa in April. Dr. Maurice C.
Langhorne, ’25, Chairman of the
Department of Psychology at Emory
University, was the alumnus chosen
to membership. Undergraduates in-
cluded three law students, eight

of Vickers, Virginia, and William
R. Cogar and John F. Kay, both
of Charleston, West Virginia. Sen-
iors chosen were William H.
Bartsch of Washington; Watson A.

mf ON APRIL 17 THE College Press
Conference, a nationwide ABC
television program, featured Robert
E. Bradford, a member of the Class
of 1955, in an interview with Re-
publican Senator Clifford Case of
New Jersey. The show’s producers
invited Bradford to appear on the
program in view of his outstanding
background in radio news presenta-
tion and commentary. While at
Washington and Lee he won for
four consecutive years the top
award of the Virginia Associated
Press for non-metropolitan station
news commentary with his produc-
tion and broadcast of a fifteen-
minute news analysis program over
station WREL each Sunday.

B TWO SENIOR JOURNALISM students,
Roy C. Martin of Glasgow, Vir-

ginia, and M. Lewis Cope of Mar-
shall, Texas, have been awarded
the James Street Awards for audio-
visual communications for 1955.
Both received recognition for tape-
recording interview work done dur-
ing the past year.

Martin’s entry was an original
radio public service documentary
program dealing with the reaction
of Lexington and _ Rockbridge
County school officials to the Su-
preme Court’s segregation decision.
Cope’s entry dealt with the signif-
icance and effects of the decision
to suspend football at Washington
and Lee for the 1954 season.

‘These awards honor James Street,
the late distinguished American
writer, who donated funds for them
two years ago, and are designed to
encourage and recognize imagina-
tive production in audio-visual
media. Competition is primarily
among students in the course in
audio-visual communications.

Professor O. W. Riegel, director
of the Lee Memorial Journalism
Foundation, reports that several
motion picture documentaries on
the local scene were completed too
late for judging this year and will
be entered next year.

ATHLETICS

m ONLY ONE SPRING sports team at
Washington and Lee won more
contests than it lost, but just about
everyone connected with the athlet-
ic program will agree that the 1955
season was a successful one.

The criteria by which Athletic
Director Cy Twombly and _ his
coaches judge the results successful
are these: (1) the largest participa-
tion on record of students in the
spring sports program, and (g) the
enthusiasm displayed by the ath-
letes, even in losing efforts.

All this is not to say that Wash-
ington and Lee is emphasizing par-
ticipation and minimizing the de-

14

sire to win. Nothing could be fur-
ther from the truth, for every man
on every team played his heart out
to win in every game. The losses
were disappointing, but very few
players became discouraged when
the victories were hard to come by,
and team morale was just as high
for the final contests of the season
as it was in the beginning.

The increased participation in
spring sports was due largely to the
ereat number of freshmen and
sophomores who came out for the
teams. One reason for this was
the fact that this year for the first
time students who played varsi-
ty sports were given physical edu-
cation class credit. This may have
encouraged some to take part who
would not otherwise have com-
peted, but it must be remembered
that a student who plays a varsity
sport puts in many more hours of
hard work than does the fellow who
attends physical education classes
three hours a week, so they were
not making things easier on them-
selves by competing.

Coach Twombly believes these
same freshmen and sophomores will
continue to compete in intercolle-
giate sports even after their psysical

education requirements are ful-
filled. He believes that the increased
participation was due more to a
new realization on the part of stu-
dents of the real purpose behind the
Washington and Lee athletic pro-
gram. At every turn this year,
coaches have sought to emphasize
that the sports are available for the
benefit of the students and the
students alone. While all cannot
make the teams, all are invited to
try to make them, and the result has
been a rejuvenation of the entire
athletic program at the University.

With the freshmen and sopho-
mores dominating the rosters, the
relative inexperience of the athletes
was reflected in spotty performances
in each of the five spring sports.

The only team to finish the sea-
son with a winning record was
Coach Charlie Herbert’s fine young
lacrosse squad. ‘Their record of
five wins, two losses and a tie fails
to reflect the real strength of the
team or the splendid work of its
28-year-old coach.

Boasting a strong nucleus of boys
from the lacrosse capital of the
world, Baltimore, the Generals
turned in the best record a Wash-
ington and Lee stick team has
ever compiled. And it should have
been even greater, says Coach Her-
bert. The final match against Vir-
einia was a _ heartbreaker and
one the Generals really wanted to
win. But as in the match against
Loyola in the season’s opener, they
waited too long to get rolling. ‘Vhey
scored seven goals in the last quar-
ter but fell short by a 12-11 margin
to end the season on a sour note.

The 12-12 tie with Loyola was
another one the Generals should
have taken, Herbert says, but it was
the matter of inexperience that kept
the stickmen from coming up to
their best. They later beat soundly
several teams that trounced the
Loyola team.

The 15-2 loss to Maryland, the
national champions, was nothing of
which to be ashamed, and Herbert
feels that next year’s team could

Southern Conference Champions

IGHLIGHT OF THE SPRING sports calendar was the
H surprising triumph of Coach Cy ‘Twombly’s
golfers in the Southern Conference tournament at
Danville, Virginia. While it was the only match the
Generals won all year, the Conference trophy more
than made up for narrow-margin losses in previous
dual matches. Again, but this time in reverse, it was
the unpredictable play of inexperienced young players
that held the key to the team’s success. Theodore M.
Kerr, a slender, crew-cut sophomore from Midland,
Texas, caught fire at Danville, carding a 138 for the
36-hole event, ten strokes better than the runner-up,
and sufficient to beat out The Citadel by two strokes.

While the Danville performance was the only
bright spot of the past season, ‘Twombly goes out on a
limb about team prospects for the next two years. Kerr
promises to develop into a top-notch individual per-
former. The other youngsters shot good golf this year,
but when the competition became intense, their in-
experience told on them and they lost, often by very
narrow margins. Twombly feels that with added ex-
perience, his teams of the next two years will have the
best depth of any he has coached in many a year.

In addition to Kerr, this year’s team included Fred
Bear, Jr., of Montgomery, Alabama, the only senior
on the team; John E. and Otis D. Chapoton, fresh-
men from Galveston, Texas; Ellis Drew, a junior
from Anderson, South Carolina; and Donald Rosen-
feld of Ladue, Missouri, a sophomore.

Fifty-six top-level representatives of business and industry met in

April to consider corporate contributions to higher education.

Out of that conference came these significant points of agreement.

Twenty Points of Agreement

NE OF THE MOST encouraging
O of recent developments in
the field of corporate giving took
place at Arden House, Harriman,
New York, on April 1-2 when fifty-
six top-level representatives of busi-
ness and industry came together
for the Conference on Corporate
Contributions. It was jointly spon-
sored by the Council for Financial
Aid to Education and Columbia
University’s School of Business, and
it drew an imposing array of presi-
dents, board chairmen, and other
key executives of major corpora-
tions for nearly forty-eight hours
of stimulating discussion. For much
of the time, the participants met in
four small groups for full and trank
discussion of the topic. Each of
the four groups drew up a report
for presentation at a plenary ses-
sion. There, after continued gen-
eral discussion, the participants
were able to compile an impressive
list of twenty subjects on which
there was agreement. Here, with
permission of the Council for F1-
nancial Aid to Education, are the
twenty points of agreement reached
at the Conference:

1. Helping to support higher
education is sound business policy,
but represents an opportunity
rather than a responsibility.

2. Once started on helping to
support higher education, business
should plan to “stay with it.” But
while recognizing the need for con-
tinuity of support, business firms
cannot be expected to take on long
term commitments to institutions of
higher education.

This article is reprinted here, with
permission, from the Alumni Digest for
May 13, 1955, published by the American
Alumni Council.

3. Business wants to accept some
reasonable share in aiding higher
education, but is not going to as-
sume the exclusive support of col-
leges and universities.

4. If an aid-to-education — pro-
gram is properly conceived, proper-
ly planned and properly carried
out, there need be no objection
from stockholders or employees.
Such a program should be re-
ported to stockholders, but, like
other management responsibilities,
it should not be submitted for ap-
proval.

5. Under the conditions stipulat-
ed in No. 4, there is no particular
need for a company to fear criticism
of its ald of higher education.

6. Company grants of aid to edu-
cation ought to be publicized—the
manner of publicizing to be left
to the individual corporation.

7. Companies cannot expect im-
mediate benefits from grants to
higher education. In the long run,
very real benefits are to be expected.
It was the consensus that grants
cannot be related specifically to fu-
ture profits of a donor company.

8. Each company must determine
for itself the total amount it pro-
vides to aid education. ‘There is
no common yardstick.

g. As to the type of institutions
to be given support, the consensus
seems to be: give priority to inde-
pendent colleges and universities,
but do not rule out the tax-sup-
ported ones.

10. The quality characteristics in
beneficiary institutions include (a)
sound financial management, (b)
evidence of substantial alumni sup-
port, and (c) accreditation by ap-
propriate agencies. But it is recog-
nized that many institutions, not

now accredited, are performing a
useful function, and should be as-
sisted to build up the strengths
that may earn accreditation.

11. No over-all plan for com-
pany allocations of grants will
serve all cases. :

12. Scholarships (for undergradu-
ate students) are regarded by many
companies as a feasible and useful
form of aid to education. But
a cost - of - education supplement
should be paid to the enrolling
institution, for its unrestricted use
in current operations.

13. As a corollary, a company
should not put a financial burden
on a college or university because
of the nature of the grant(s) which
it makes to the institution.

i4. [fa company provides tellow-
ship funds for professional or grad-
uate students, it should pay a cost-
of-education supplement to the en-
rolling institution regardless of
whether it is independent or tax-
supported.

15. From among _ the
types of aid needed by colleges and
universities, donor companies must
make their individual selections.
Each company must determine
what it wants to do and what are
the needs of any college it desires
to support.

16. Nevertheless, the urgency of
providing funds to raise the scale
of faculty salaries was recognized
by all of the conferees.

17. It was agreed that
company, in making grants to high-
er education, should scrupulously
avoid infringing upon academic
freedom, or upsetting college ad-
ministrative procedures. ‘The gen-
eral attitude was: pick your insti-
tution carefully, give, and then
hands off its internal affairs.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

18. Each company has to deter-
mine for itself the kind of intra-
corporate organization it needs to
administer its program of aid to
higher education.

19. A company foundation 1s a
means of insuring stability and con-
tinuity of giving, in bad times as
well as good. Such a foundation is
not, however, equally well suited to
the purpose of all companies.

20. Grants of aid to colleges and
universities are an investment, nota
gift or a charitable gesture.

IN ITS MIMEOGRAPHED report on
the deliberations of the Conference
on Corporate Contributions at
Arden House, the Council for F1-
nancial Aid to Education, by agree-
ment, does not associate the names
of the participants with any of the
specific comments or remarks made
during the discussion. Nonetheless,
most of the observations made by
this group of business leaders will
be read with real interest and
value by all those concerned with
this important development in edu-
cational philanthropy.

More
spoke vigorously on the subject

than one industrialist
of alumni giving in the course of
arriving at a general agreement
on Point No. 10 of the list carried
above: “Quality characteristics in
beneficiary institutions include (a)
sound financinal management, (b)
evidence of substantial alumni sup-
port, and (c) accreditation. ”
Here are some direct quotations
from the transcript:

“|. One of the things that shocked
me when I went through the Refer-
ence Book was the figures on the
degree of alumni support which
the universities are now getting.
The reporting institutions now
have, I think, an average of 20.5 per
cent participation, and an average
contribution of $25. It seems to me
we can put a little more emphasis
on the universities” ‘management of
funds’ and ‘management of pro-

> 99

erams for securing funds’.

‘“...In our group we discussed the
question whether it would be ap-

JUNE 1955

propriate for us to suggest that, in
their own interest, universities
might make a more effective pre-
sentation than they are now making
of their efforts to secure funds from
their own family group and other
available resources.”

“...Our group arrived at this: We
shouldn’t tell colleges and univer-
sities what they have to do in these
areas (1.e., in alumni support and
good management). We simply state
to them, clearly, that one of the

things we’re going to take into ac-
count when we are considering
grants to them is what evidence they
can bring to us on this point.”

“ ..1 think the fundamental fact
here is that business doesn’t want
to take over the whole job. It wants
to take over some reasonable part
of financial aid, but it’s not going
to assume the exclusive support of
colleges and universities. ‘They have
to show they’re getting some other
support.”

possibly be in contention for na-
tional honors itself. He loses a few
key players, including Dick
“Stumpy” Johnson and Harry Ford,
both of whom Herbert chose for
the All-South squad which he
coaches this year for the annual
All-Star game.

CoacH Brtty MCCANN was un-
able to work wonders with the base-
ball team as he had with the Gen-
erals basketball team in the winter
months, but even in a losing season
there were bright spots.

The biggest were the pitching
performances turned in by soph-

~omores Joe Knakal and Joe Amato

and junior Dick Skolnik. Knakal
tamed the Richmond Spiders twice,
Amato pitched brilliantly in spots
although he failed to win a game,
and Skolnik—the really hard-luck
guy of the mound staff—showed
marked improvement as the sea-
son progressed. Only the Generals’
lack of power hitters and failure to
hit with the ducks on the pond kept
these boys in the losing columns.
‘Any coach in the Southern Con-
ference would love to have them on
their teams,” McCann said. “If we
could have hit the ball this year we
would have had a good year.”
Knakal was named to the Vir-
ginia Big Six second team, along
with first baseman Dickie Kops, a
senior and co-captain. Outfielder
Cal Couch, a freshman and the
team’s leading hitter at .368, re-

ceived honorable mention on the
Southern Conference all-star team.

CoacH Norm Lorp’s track forces
are also due for better things next
year. The General thinclads boasted
good men in almost all events, but
they lacked the team depth neces-
sary to win. In winning one dual
meet and losing seven, the Generals
were outclassed badly in only the
VPI and William and Mary tilts.

‘The team was sparked by Cap-
tain Harry Kennedy, Charleston,
West Virginia senior, who could be
counted on for points in both
hurdle events and the broad jump.
Freshman Frank Hoss high jumped
over six feet on several occasions;
sophomore Alex Platt broke the
school discus record and threatened
the shot standard; junior Randy
Creel approached the javelin mark;
and frosh Paul Ironside showed
good dash form—all encouraging
signs for future track seasons.

‘THE GENERAL’S TENNIS. team,
coached this year by Dick Miller,
finished with a 5-5 record in
matches and with a fourth in the
Southern Conference tournament.
Relatively speaking, the tennis
squad played the toughest schedule
in the spring sports slate.

‘They absorbed sound beatings
from Rollins College, ranked. sec-
ond nationally, Southern Confer-
ence champion Davidson, and al-
ways-powerful Colgate, but the
losses to Georgetown and Wayne
were by one-point margins.

The President of the Association reports at the close of —

Two Challenging Years

WILLIAM L. WEBSTER, 12

ITH THESE REMARKS, and the
W close of this meeting this af-
ternoon, I shall terminate two very
happy, interesting, and personally
valuable years as President of our
Alumni Association. They have
been years during which I have
come into closer contact with Wash-
ington and Lee, its alumni and stu-
dents, its faculty and administra-
tion, its policies, and yes, its prob-
lems, than I had ever dreamed
might be my opportunity.

They have been challenging years.
I saw, for example, Washington
and Lee’s Student Executive Com-
mittee face squarely and resolutely
a very severe infraction of the
Honor System we prize so highly;
and I saw the Honor System, to say
nothing of the student body, gain
in stature for the splendid manner
in which the students themselves
dealt with that infraction.

I lived with the many misunder-
standings that grew out of the Uni-
versity’s decision to discontinue the
subsidization of athletics. I believe
that Washington and Lee is now
stronger for the integrity of its de-
cision, for the determination with
which it held to its position, and
for the patient consideration with
which it sought to clarify the mis-
understandings that arose. And in
all this I like to believe that your
Alumni Board was helpful.

I hasten to add that in this mat-
ter, and in others which have come
before the Board, I take no person-
al credit. Rather, any credit proper-
ly belongs to the individuals whom
you elected to the Board.

Let me indicate just how active
your Alumni Board has been dur-
ing the past year. We have had
three full meetings. The first was
held in Washington in October so
that we might meet with the Uni-
versity Board of Trustees and dis-
cuss with them at length matters
of mutual concern and _ interest,
primary among them the misunder-
standings that arose in the wake of
the athletic decisions.

This was followed by a special
meeting in Lexington in January,
at which time we gave further con-
sideration to those misunderstand-
ings and had another opportunity
to have lunch and to talk with
members of the University Board.
‘These two meetings, plus the gen-
erous portions of time which each
Board member gave to discussion
with other alumni, with members
of the University’s administration

 

WEBSTER

and faculty, and with Lexington
townspeople, led to the special re-
port that appeared in the March
issue of the Alumni Magazine.

And yesterday we had our third
Board meeting of this college year.

In addition to these activities,
some members of the Alumni Board
served on a_ special committee,
chairmanned by Martin Burks, to
consider and advance the project
of an Alumni House on campus.
Here again, generous amounts of
time, both in and out of committee,
were involved.

I believe you will agree with me
that members of the Alumni Board
do make a genuine effort to follow
University activities closely and to
give a full measure of service to
Washington and Lee and to you
who elect them.

ET ME TURN NOW to the work of
| the Alumni office and of its
Executive Secretary during the past
year. My commendations for both
are of the highest order. ‘There has
been, I know, a conscious effort
on Cy Young’s part to open and
widen the channels of communica-
tion between the University and its
alumni. He and other University
officials have been traveling often
and far to meet with regional chap-
ters so that alumni far afield from
Lexington may better know what
is happening on the campus, and
why. And in preparing the Alumni
Magazine and sending it to all
as is now done, an equally import-
ant effort is being made to present,
and to interpret, information about
Washington and Lee to the alumni.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

 

 

 

The Alumni Fund_ has been
strengthened in many ways, notable
among them the extension of our
program of personal solicitation,
begun a year ago, to twenty-nine
chapter areas. ‘These efforts to
strengthen the Fund will continue,
I am sure, to the end that annual
giving will become an even more
significant factor in Washington
and Lee’s continued welfare.

In May of this year the Univer-
sity sponsored the first 25-Year Con-
vocation and Reunion. The Alumni
Office and a faculty committee were
instrumental in its planning and
execution. Members of the aca-
demic and law Classes of 1930 and
their wives were guests of the Uni-
versity for the better part of two
days, during which time they not
only had an opportunity to enjoy
themselves thoroughly, but also had
the equally important opportunity
to see the University in action and
to discuss its program and its needs
with members of the faculty and
administration.

All in all, | think this has been
an excellent year. At its beginning
we were faced with what seemed
to be adversity (I refer to the after-
math of the athletic decisions), but
it seems to me that we were success-
ful in turning adversity into ad-
vantage, with the result that both
the University and the Alumni As-
sociation have been strengthened.

WOULD BE REMIsS if I were to

close without calling attention
to the University’s Development
Program, and to the key role Wash-
ington and Lee’s alumni must play
if it is to be successful. That pro-
gram is concerned with matters that
are vital to the health and well-be-
ing of Washington and Lee: the
salaries of the faculty members,
scholarship funds for deserving
young men, the library, and essen-
tial additions and renovations to
the University’s physical plant. The
Development Program cannot be
regarded lightly.

Nor can we who are the _ bene-

JUNE 1955

ficiaries of a Washington and Lee
education regard our own respon-
sibilities lightly. I believe that we
must show by expenditures of our
time, thought, energy, and funds,
that we believe in Washington and
Lee and all for which it stands.
Only when we, the alumni, have
done our part can we _ expect
others—corporations, foundations,
parents, and friends of the Univer-
sity—to assist. If we accept the re-
sponsibilities that are ours, and
rise to the opportunity they pre-
sent, we can be a_ bulwark = of
strength to our beloved alma mater.

And I suggest that for doing so
our reward, though intangible, will

be many-fold. It will lie in the sat-
isfaction that comes of knowing
that we are helping future genera-
tions of Washington and Lee men
who, just as we have done in years
past, will travel the walks of this
campus, learn in the classrooms of
its buildings, and benefit from the
traditions we have come to value
so highly. It will take form in the
confidence we feel that these young
men will make a mark in the world
that will be a credit to themselves
and to Washington and Lee. And
certainly we shall be rewarded in
the pride we will feel as, in the fu-
ture, we welcome them into our
own Alumni Association.

From the Assoctation’s New President,

A Statement of Conviction

Joun F. HENDON, ’24

AS I TAKE OFFICE as President, and
certainly I am a novice, please al-
low me to state a personal convic-
tion which is very much a part of
me. It was extremely well put in an
editorial that appeared in an April
issue of the Wall Street Journal.
‘There it was noted that Dr. Gordon

 

HENDON

Gray, president of the oldest state-

supported university in the country, ©

the University of North Carolina,
had said in a recent speech in Los
Angeles that were he to have to
choose between saving the inde-
pendent institutions of higher
learning and those supported by the
state, he would choose to save the
independent colleges.

This statement carries my con-
viction. I firmly believe that the
purpose of education is the develop-
ment of minds in an atmosphere of
free inquiry. Since leaving Wash-
ington and Lee in 1924, in my busi-
ness I have felt very often the threat
of government encroachment on
the field of private enterprise. Will
not this same threat come to institu-
tions of higher learning unless com-
plete freedom from government in-
fluence and support is observed in
the teaching of our future citizens?

With this conviction in mind |
promise to do my best in the serv-
ice of this institution as President
of the Alumni Association.

The Alumni Secretary makes

A Report of Progress

Harry K. (Cy) YOUNG, ‘17

AM HAPPY to make this annual
I report to the alumni, and I am
happy to be able to call it a report
of progress.

Somewhere along in the late
summer or early fell of last year
there were serious doubts on the
part of some that alumni work
would actually prosper again; and
all of us will agree that the 1954-55
year has been a strenuous one. I am
sure that every alumnus is acquaint-
ed with the July 23 decision of the
University Board of ‘Trustees to
cancel our 1954 football schedule
and to discontinue subsidization of
athletics at Washington and Lee.
Unfortunately many of our alumni
interpreted the newspaper and mag-
azine articles to mean that we were
discontinuing football—which was
never the intention of the Trustees.

Thus the tumult began in the
Alumni Office and, in fact, in all
of the administrative offices on the
campus. For several months it was
our main job to see that the alumni
clearly understood Washington and

 

MartIN P. Burks, III, ’32, of Roanoke was
chosen to a three-year Alumni Board term.

22

Lee’s new athletic policy—its whys
and its wherefores. Let me mention
here three published statements,
sent to all alumni, that proved of
inestimable help in making clear
the athletic situation and in dis-
pelling many rumors that had
arisen. The first of these was a letter
written by Dr. Gaines and sent to
all alumni and parents on August
5. Lhe second was an article written
by Mr. James R. Caskie, Rector of
the Board, and printed in the De-
cember issue of the Alumni Maga-
zine. And the third statement,
which was the result of many con-
ferences and much study, appeared
in the March issue of the Maga-
zine and was the expression of our
own Alumni Board. I am grateful
for all these excellent presentations
of fact.

Many of the reactions were un-
derstandable, especially in the light
of the long football history of the
institution, but it is now clear to
most that the decisions made were
the only ones possible if the best
interests of Washington and Lee
were to be served. We will have a
football team in 1955 and we hope
that a fine crowd will return for
Homecoming on October 22.

As was said in one of the three
statements just mentioned, “It has
been clearly demonstrated to us
that there is a real need for more
adequate communication between
the University and its alumni.”

This leads me into the second
topic of my report: Development.
By now all alumni should be fa-
miliar with the fact that we do
have a Development Program in
progress at Washington and Lee,
and that under the guidance of its
director, Donald E. Smith, this pro-
eram is making important strides.
The Alumni Office and the Devel-

opment Office are not only located
side by side in Washington Hall,
but they are actually working side
by side in every sense.

Another aspect of this Develop-
ment Program, designed to open
channels of communication, was
initiated this spring. On May 13
and 14, the University invited to
the campus as their guests the mem-
bers of the Law and Academic
Classes of 1930 on the occasion of
their twenty-fifth anniversary. ‘Thus
have we begun the 25-Year Re-
union. This was the first effort to
bring a reunion class to the campus
while school is in session. In addi-
tion to the usual social events, a
planned program made it possible
for the men, and their wives, to see
the college in operation and to hear
members of the administration and
faculty report on the state of the
University. I believe that every man
who came was reassured about his
Alma Mater, enjoyed the program,
and went away with new interest.
Attendance far exceeded our ex-
pectations. We plan to continue
reunions with
classes. Moreover, next year we
hope to add the 50-Year Class, and
to have members of the Classes of
1906 and 1931 as our guests.

Another phase of our program
for broadening the channels of

such succeeding

communications between the Uni-

named vice-president of the Association.

versity and its alumni concerns
the Alumni Magazine. | am sure
you have noticed that your maga-
zine looks different. As for its con-
tents, I hope you have noticed that
we have tried to give you up-to-date
news both on the University and
on your fellow alumni.

In addition to re-styling the mag-
azine, we now are sending it to
every alumnus of Washington and
Lee for whom we have a correct
address on file. To send it to this
enlarged audience of approximately
11,000 alumni is the realization of
a hope we have cherished for many
years. The additional cost to your
Association has been about $3,500,
but we think you will agree it Is
money well spent.

In another effort to keep the
alumni abreast of the University
we mailed to every alumnus Dr.
Gaines’ special “Report of the
President to the Alumni.” The re-
sponse from alumni to this sum-
mary of the University’s activity for
the preceding year was so favorable
that I hope the practice will be
continued in the future.

With the increase of activity in
the Alumni Office, it has not been
possible for me to attend as many
of the local chapter meetings as I
had hoped for. Every chapter in our
organization (and we now have 37
active chapters) has had one or

JUNE 1955

more good meetings this year and
a representative from the University
was present at most of these. Our
chapters have never supported us
more generously and more loyally
than during the past year—perhaps
we have never needed this assurance
of their cooperation more.

The alumni chapters serve in
many ways, but I shall mention
here only one service, at this time
perhaps their greatest—the recruit-
ment of students for the University.
At a time when we have so many
more applications than we can pos-
sibly accept, we need all the help
we can get in selecting the right
boys for Washington and Lee.

Throughout all of the activities
that by their very nature relate the
Alumni Program to the Develop-
ment Program, we have been stress-
ing-one theme: we should not hope
for great support from those outside
the University family until we can
first demonstrate a solid measure of
alumni support.

Although there is much work to
be done to bring our Alumni Fund
into line with the funds of other
colleges and universities compar-
able to us in size and purpose, we
definitely are making progress.
Fach year the organization of the
annual fund seems to run a little
smoother. For example, men now

 

ERNEST Woopwarb, II, ’40, of Louisville
was named to a three-year Board term.

 

ParKE S. Rouse, Jr., 37, of Williamsburg
was chosen to a three-year Board term.

seem glad to serve as Class Agents
and in many instances we have had
volunteers for this important assign-
ment. Also, with the new office
equipment we have procured dur-
ing the past two years, we are in a
much better position to serve our
Class Agents and our Regional
Agents. With regard to the latter,
this year we have 29 Regional
Agents as compared with 12 last
year. They and their committees
are working, and through the per-
sonal solicitation they conduct, we
hope for our largest gain.

It is a pleasure for me to an-
nounce that, as of June 1, a total
of 1,977 alumni have contributed
$50,483.87 to the 1955 Alumni
Fund. Both of these figures repre-
sent an increase over any previous
year on the same date.

In closing, I should like to thank
all of those who have made this
such a fine year for your Alumni
Association: President Gaines, the
members of his administrative staff,
Class and Regional Agents, the
ladies in the Alumni and Develop-
ment Offices. And particularly, I
want to express publicly to the
members of the Alumni Board and
to Mr. W. L. Webster, President of
the Alumni Association, my deep
gratitude for their wonderful co-
operation and active interest dur-
ing an especially difficult year.
