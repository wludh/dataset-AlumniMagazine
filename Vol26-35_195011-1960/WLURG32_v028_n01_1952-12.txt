1052 Students Report for Matriculatio

 

Something new has been added to the conventional dress of jacket, slacks, and
beanie of Washington and Lee University freshmen as they try on their new
ROTC uniforms. Established on the campus only last year, the Army Transpor-
tation Corps unit has already proved popular with the first-year men, with nearly
the entire freshman class enrolling. Seen above, during an initial fitting are: H. K.
(Cy) Young, alumni director; C. Dudley Rodgers, Jr., of Little Rock, Arkansas;
Orson K. (Mike) Earp, Jr., of Memphis, Tennessee; Lt. Col. J. G. Bowes asso-
ciate professor of military science and tactics, and William H. Houston, III, of
Tunica, Mississippi.

By J. W. BENJAMIN, 754

The 204th opening of Washing-
ton and Lee University on Friday,
September 19, found the student
body summoned to “an awareness
of duty” by President Francis P.
Gaines.

In his “first day of school” ad-
dress, Dr. Gaines urged the stu-
dents to “justify the policy and
reason to be here” by preparing for
the safety of the nation as well as
readying for their own careers.

He stated that the college stu-
dent today is by no means “sepa-
rated from the great fear and anx-
iety of the race,” but denounced
the “fatalism imbedded in many”
out of which “no greatness is ever
born.”

The Washington and Lee stu-
dent “has a responsibility of sev-
eral kinds,” Dr. Gaines said. “This

4.

includes preparation for service to
country as well as to career. There
is no future for the young man
who wastes opportunities of today

“Tomorrow is not brighteneq

Dr. Gaines appeared plea
with the student body he wags
dressing. With applications for
mission 25 per cent more numer
than last year, the freshman
enrolled 301, 13 more than
year. A total of 1,052 stude
paid attention to his words, as
pared with 1,044 last year.

Other states with large numbers
of favorite sons are Maryland with
89, Pennsylvania 68, West Vir-
ginia 65, New Jersey 56, Ohio 53,
Kentucky 36, Florida 36, and
Connecticut 17.

Far away California sent 4 sons

Northern Maine sent 3, New Mex-
ico sent 3, and Michigan 8. The

Puerto Rico has 3 representa-
tives at the University, while Mex-
ico and Hawaii have 2 each. Hav-
ing one in attendance are Africa,
Denmark, England, France, Ger-
many, Jordan, Venezuela, Brazil
and Bolivia.

The first week of school was
largely taken over by the annual
“rush week.” This year 86 per cent
of the freshman class, 258 men,
pledged the seventeen fraternities.

record numerically, and was only

Leading the fraternities in the
size of pledge classes was Phi Kap-
pa Sigma with 19, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon with 18, Phi Kappa Psi
with 17, and Sigma Chi with 16.

Several fraternities pledged 15,
including Zeta Beta Tau, Beta
Theta Pi, Sigma Nu, Pi Kappa
Alpha, and Kappa Alpha.

The ROTC unit began its sec-
ond year with a corps almost

double that of last year’s. The 480
men that form the corps are being
organized into 5 companies.

The new band, organized last
year with surprising success, now
numbers 60 pieces, including a
bones player and an accomplished
bag pipe player.

Extra-curricular activities began
in good style with the Christian
Council, under John Maguire,
showing unusual vigor. Of princi-
pal interest on the campus this
year was the national election. Last
year’s Mock Convention picked
Eisenhower as the Republican can-
didate and raised political discus-
sion to a fever pitch.

The Ring-tum Phi began a new
policy under Editor-in-Chief Leo
Barrington this year. Politics and
world news are being emphasized
along with student activities. A
political column and a_ news-
roundup have become regular fea-
tures of the paper. At least one
editorial each issue deals with
events and ideas outside the normal
college sphere of life.

The Southern Collegian is back
on campus this year after its sus-
pension last year, in a subtle and
subdued form.

Old students and alumni would

5

 

say there is really no difference
between the opening of school this
year and that of any other session.
The processes of youth and edu-
cation are slow in changing.

Of the year ahead Dean Frank
J. Gilliam says, “Contrary to ex-
isting trends among most colleges,
applications are better than normal
in number at Washington and
Lee. This year we had the largest
number of completed freshmen
applications, with the registrations
paid, that we’ve experienced since
the influx of the veterans imme-
diately following World War II.
The College Board averages of the
freshmen are appreciably higher
than last year’s. With these things
as an excellent start, I believe we
can look forward to another produc-
tive and prosperous year.”

Gorham Co., New York, now in its
second edition. The book is on the
select recommended list of Ameri-
can Library Association and that
of American Legion Americaniza-
tion Committee. It has received un-
qualified endorsement from relig-
ious leaders, both Protestant and
Catholic. Quoting from an editorial
in Life, March 10, 1952—“Com-
munism and Christ by an Episco-
pal theologian of Maryland who al-
so understands Marx... . proves
that the strongest appeal of Marx-
ism—precisely because it is dog-
matically antireligious—is to the
religious capacity with which man-
kind was endowed at birth.”

This second edition of Commun-
ism and Christ carries on the jack-
et front the following two sentences
from a letter written to Dr. Lowry
by Dr. Francis P. Gaines: “I am
recommending Communism and
and Christ to practically every
thoughtful person that I see. ... I
have never seen anything better in
the field, and for practical purposes
nothing as good.”

The Late
Honorable George C. Peery, ’97

Former Governor of Virginia
GrorGE CAMPBELL PEErRy died
October 14, 1952, at the Mary
Williams Hospital at Richlands,
Virginia, after a five-year illness.
He would have been 79 years old
on October 28. His son, Albert
Gillespie Peery, B.A., 31, LL.B.,
32, was with him when he died.

The 6-foot 3-inch ‘Tazewell
County lawyer and former Ninth
District Congressman had been in
declining health and had spent the
last several years in and out of
hospitals.

Governor Peery came forcibly to
State-wide notice in 1922, when he
‘tedeemed” the Ninth Congres-
sional District of Southwest Vir-
ginia from the long-time rule of
the Republicans under Slemps,
lather and son. This made him the
idol of the “Mountain Empire” and
led Naturally to his election as Gov-
‘or in 1933, after he had served
three terms in Congress and four
years on the State Corporation
mmission,

Governor Peery came into the
“*ecutive mansion in January of
1934, at the very bottom of the
“Pression. Where other men
“ght have surrendered to the po-

litical excesses of that unhappy
time, he chose a course of sound-
ness and frugality. He pulled the
State’s finances through a difficult
period in splendid shape. When he
turned his office over to his succes-
sor, Governor Price, the State had
a surplus of $5,000,000, and the
lowest debt it had enjoyed in 70
years. He was in everything, and
in every fine meaning of the word,
a conservative. Clinging to that
which he viewed as sound, he did
not hesitate to seek out and experi-
ment with that which was new—
old-age assistance, unemployment
compensation, the ABC system,
and a far tighter plan (just now
adopted for 1952) for punishing
the wilfully reckless motorists. He
regarded government as a trust,
and himself as its fiduciary.
Governor Peery received his
LL.B. degree from Washington
and Lee in 1897. He was a member
of Kappa Sigma social fraternity,
and was initiated in Phi Beta Kap-
pa, honorary fraternity, in 1929.
He became a member of the Uni-
versity Board of Trustees in 1929.

The sudden and unexpected
death of Lieutenant-Governor L.
Preston Couuins, A.B., ’20, on
September 20, shocked Virginians
of all parties and political faiths
as well as his host of friends among
the alumni of Washington and Lee.
He suffered a heart attack as he was
being introduced as speaker at the
dedication of a Wythe County
school near Austinville, Virginia.
“Pat” Collins was a useful public
servant, who not only demonstrated
remarkable ability as the Senate’s
presiding officer, but who also has
shown unusual political courage on
a number of occasions. Long a
resident of Marion, Virginia, he
began the practice of law in Wythe-

‘Wink’ Glasgow Killed

In Action in Korea

Second Lieutenant FRANCIS
THomaAs GLascow, B.A., 749,
was killed in action in Korea on
Saturday, August 9, 1952, accord-
ing to a telegram from the War
Department received by his family,
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Glasgow,
B.A., ’09, of Lexington, Virginia.
His death occurred on the first day
of a Communist drive to capture
“Bunker Hill.”

A letter received here from an
officer who had served with him in
Korea stated that Lt. Glasgow
crawled out from a bunker at a
forward observation post to try to
correct the direction of the Amer-
ican artillery and was killed in-
stantly by a bullet.

Lt. Glasgow entered the service
in October, 1950, and received his

y

 

basic training at Fort Knox, Ken-
tucky. He was commissioned in
the Field Artillery at Fort Sill,
Oklahoma, in December, 1951,
and after receiving further training
in mountain fighting at Camp Carl-
son, Colorado, he went overseas in
May.

He received the B.A. degree
from Washington and Lee in 1949,
where he was a member of the
Delta Tau Delta social fraternity
and Omicron Delta Kappa leader-
ship fraternity and participated in
a wide variety of campus activities.

 

Independent Colleges
Establish Foundation

The independent and church af-
filiated institutions of higher learn-
ing in Virginia have banded to-
gether in an organization to further
their common objectives.

Chartered in September as the
Virginia Foundation for Indepen-
dent Colleges, the organization will
have offices at Lynchburg, Vir-
ginia. Fourteen institutions are
charter members of the organiza-
tion. Officers are: Dr. Francis P.
Gaines, president of Washington
and Lee University, president; Dr.
Warren D. Bowman, president of

Bridgewater College, vice-presi-
dent; and Dr. John R. Everett,
president of Hollins, secretary-

treasurer. Each of the institutions
is represented by its president and
one member of its governing board.
Mr. James R. Caskie, ’06, a trustee
of Washington and Lee, is the
second representative of the Uni-
versity.

The function of the foundation
is to interpret the aims, functions,
and needs of member colleges to
the public with a view of attaining
a better understanding of their im-
portance to the state and nation.
The foundation is authorized under
its charter from the state to solicit
and receive funds for the benefit
and use of its member colleges.

Similar organizations have been
perfected in several states, those
in Indiana and Ohio having been

THE ALUMNI MAGAZP

 

A university: a place flowing
ith intellectual discussion, bur-
c ned with transfer of factual
tnowled&e from the old to the
young; bristling with a hundred
activities, seething from the pres-
sures of work and tests under the
axiom of the survival of the fittest,
lush week-end excitement, and so
drivingly continuous that it has
caused many a student to remark,
“Life is just one damn thing af-
ter another.”

But through this seeming hodge
podge of studies and activities there
runs one central theme which ties
all together at the ultimate; the
theme set forth in the first by-law
of the official Washington and
Lee regulations, “The obligation to
inculcate the Christian ideal is here-
by acknowledged.”

The student organization which
works at and for the manifesta-
tion of this ideal is the Christian
Council, a group of 75 students
whose work touches the life of
every student at some time during
the year.

The Christian Council is, in the

words of John Maguire, director of
religious activities, “An earthly
community founded on the com-
mon need of members, seeking
through common avenues to fur-
ther the Christian ideal.” This is
not done by an organized “revival,”
ora display of great piety, or by
barn-storming student evangelists,
but rather through study groups
and activities which influence in-
dividual lives, which in turn in-
fluence others as the ripples of a
Creek.
_ The Council divides its work
to two parts; activities, and
thought provoking discussions and
talks,

In the realm of activities the
embers conduct the annual char-
ty chest drive. Last year $1,561
Was collected. This year the total
Was almost $2,000.

By J. W. BENJAMIN, JR.

 

Some students conduct regular
Sunday services, or assist, in “mis-
sions” located in the hills around
Lexington. This is one of the most
unselfish projects of the organiza-
tion, as Sunday is traditionally the
day off for most collegians.

A Boy’s Club Committee has
formed two clubs in Lexington, one
of about 60 white boys, and one of
40 Negro youngsters. The clubs
emphasize sports, hobbies, discus-
sions, and development of leader-
ship.

The Council has penetrated the
often aloof fraternities to the ex-
tent of having a bulletin board
in each house with a schedule of
coming services and events of re-
ligious nature. Visiting lecturers
brought to the campus by the
Christian Council often visit the
fraternities and lead discussion
“bull-sessions.”

It is in the area which corre-
lates thinking with activity that the
organization is the most energetic.
Activity begins with the arrival of
freshmen at school. A retreat is
held at Goshen Pass where students
become acquainted with others of
similar ideals, and with the work
of the Christian Council. This
year’s retreat was attended by 140
freshmen.

During the year the freshmen
organize and conduct nightly ves-
per services in the dormitory, 20-
25 attending regularly—a figure
which jumps amazingly during
exams.

In an attempt to reach all stu-
dents at the University the Council
sponsors four University services
per year. In the fall a_ special
speaker is invited. This year it was
Dr. Taliafero Thompson of Union
Theological Seminary. The second
service is the annual candlelight
service which precedes Christmas

WAc sae
ASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

The Work of the Christian Council

vacation. Dr. Gaines is the tradi-
tional speaker. Another service is
held in the spring and the fourth
is Baccalaureate Sunday.

An exchange committee main-
tains correspondence with other
colleges, keeping students posted
on outstanding events coming at
nearby campuses, and planning in-
tercollege events.

The big event of the year for
the Christian Council is the annual
Religious Emphasis Week, held
in the spring. Two outstanding
lecturers are invited to the cam-
pus, each making a series of talks
to the student body. These talks,
all developing one theme, are in-
terspersed with round table dis-
cussions and private conferences.
As a result every student gets a
new lease on life, for at least a
short while, and some obtain fresh
views and new aspirations that last
a life time. Last year the speakers
were John Oliver Nelson of Yale,
and Dr. Bernard Boyd of the Uni-
versity of North Carolina. This
year Dr. William Pollard, director
of nuclear physics at Oak Ridge,
and Dr. Arnold Nash, chairman of
the religious department at North
Carolina, will visit the Washington
and Lee campus.

Of especial emphasis this year
is a series of student-faculty dis-
cussions now underway. This fall
members of the Christian Council
and a number of the faculty inter-
ested in religious work held a
round table discussion in which
they discussed “The University and
the Modern World.” A book by Dr.
Nash, The Task of the Christian in
the University, was read by all
participating members prior to the
discussion. Principal debating point
of the meeting was a question
raised by Nash concerning the ob-
jectivity of professors. According
to Nash, man can’t be completely
objective and professors should
share their personal opinions with

11

the students in an attempt to arrive
at intelligent common understand-
ing. The second meeting to be
held after Christmas, will center
around the student conception of
Christian leadership. One more dis-
cussion will be held in the spring,
while six are planned for next
year.

In the completely thought pro-
voking classification is the new
Bible study program set up by the
Council. This year 75 students
are participating in the various
small discussion groups. The study
groups meet two hours each week,
with outside reading assignments
in the Bible and related material.
The discussions are of both prac-
tical and philosophic nature as stu-
dents through the year develop a
creed of life based upon religion,
and ponder its practical manifesta-
tions in everyday life.

On the side of physical make-
up the Council itself has under-
gone a change in the last two years.
Under the leadership of Maguire,
and Ben Martin, this year’s presi-
dent, the organization has ceased
to be merely another stepping stone
for “big men on campus,” another
activity to enter beside the year-
book picture.

The Council now consists of a
president, or more properly a
“chairman,” who coordinates the
activities previously mentioned,
each of which is under a chairman
who operates independently. The
executive committee consists of 12
members, three from each class,
who meet weekly to discuss plans
and problems. ‘Towards the end of
each year underclassmen slowly
take over the chairmanships so that
the continuity of the Council ser-
vice is not broken.

In recent years the Council has
suffered from a rapid turnover of
faculty religious advisors. Maguire,
present faculty-student advisor,
says this situation should be re-
lieved next year with the appoint-
ment of a religious activity director
who will be a full time faculty
member.

Around the Campus

Maybe some of the alumni may
be interested in a short resume of
a few of the more casual aspects
of life at Washington and Lee as
it is lived now. So...

In keeping with historical tra-
dition the 1952-53 Minks. still
manage to make it “over the hill”
and “down the road” to the nearby
institutions for girls. Most students
make the trip just once a week, a
few of the more carefree “give the
girls a break” on Friday nights also.
Still fewer, close to the golden
gates of matrimonial bliss or brim-
ming with confidence concerning
their academic standing, go over
the hill on a week night.

The same schools are still visited
as before. The new four lane high-
way to Hollins has helped lift its
popularity, and two more distant
schools, Madison (Harrisonburg)
and Greenbrier (Lewisburg, West
Virginia) are moving into the week-
end limelight.

The biggest team on the campus
is still the 2:00 o’clock movie team,
with “Poppa” Daves’ State Theater
still holding forth supreme. The
Lyric has been renovated and put
under new management, and is now
drawing a fair share of the stu-
dents.

Doc’s Corner Store, “Steve’s”
and the “Liquid” still stand as a
good place for late afternoon re-
freshment. Steve’s new restaurant,
“Stevesville,” located outside of
town on the Staunton highway, has
put in television to the delight and
detriment of the student body.
Jabo, long famous to most W&L
students, has opened his own small
snack shop, located on Main Street
beside the Troub Theater.

The Dutch Inn _ has _ finally
brought cafeteria style service to
Lexington. The eating establish-
ment is filled to overflowing on
Sunday nights.

Relations with Virginia Mili-
tary Institute are on a continuously
high plane. Students at Washing-

  
  
   
   
 
   
    
  
   
 
 
   
     
 
  
   
   
  
  
   
   
   
   
   
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
  

ton and Lee have many frie;
among the Cadets. The Corps st
rouses the ire of the Minks, hoy
ever, when they march past R,
Square on Sunday morning, ye]}j
cadence and “Sound Off” in y
sion. Athletic teams from the
schools scrimmage together but
not meet in regularly schedy,
games.

Parking is now a problem —
town. With the large influx of eg
to the campus in recent years ¢
lack of adequate parking spq
sometimes produces an uncomf¢
able traffic snarl on big weekends

Lexington is still visited by o1
(very audible) train a day, whi
usually manages to make its
heard in the middle of Dr. Gain,
addresses to the student body. —

‘Tourists, more every year, fin
the Washington and Lee camp
an historical landmark. The wal
and grounds are perpetually co
ered with the travelers during
fall and spring.

One of the most outstandil
“big-name” band  combinatic
ever to appear on any camp
played at Washington and Lee th
fall for the Opening Dance Set.

Tommy Dorsey, “The Sentime
tal Gentleman,” gave the Saturd:
afternoon concert before 1300 st
dents and dates. His smooth at
versatile orchestra, with each
ber a name performer, was pr
claimed “tops.” The dance th
night was so crowded it was di
cult to move around the floor.

Only slightly less spectacul
was the appearance of Boyd R
burn’s orchestra the night before

The improvement in bands 0
tained for the University dane
was attributed to the “dance plat
now in its fourth year. The pi
allows students to sign up for
four dance sets in advance, at a?
duction in cost. This allows
Dance board to know its expé
income before the year begins, 4
to set its budget accordingly.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZI

 

Shenandoah Receives Bryher Award

Three years ago a small group
of Washington and Lee students
and faculty members gathered to
discuss literary affairs at the Uni-
versity. They were anxious to have
4 publication which would reflect
the serious nature of campus life
and creativity; to have a journal
which would not only publish the
best writing done in the classroom,
put in the whole South. Out of their
belief in the need for such a mag-
azine came Shenandoah, the Wash-
ington and Lee quarterly.

Now, with only three volumes of
the quarterly behind them, the staff
is the recipient of an award from
the Bryher Foundation, which is a
national philanthropic organization
set up to foster serious efforts in
music, art, and drama. This is
the first award of its type ever made
in Virginia, and the reason given
on the citation for choosing Shen-
andoah is one which every alum-
nus can take pride in: “For stimu-
lating creative work and _ effort
throughout the South.”

The achievement is all the more
remarkable when one considers
that the magazine has not enjoyed
official University patronage, but
has made its own way in a highly
competitive field, in days of soaring
printing costs. For two years a stu-
dent board shared the editorial bur-
dens; this year Thomas H. Carter,
from Martinsville, Virginia, has
served as editor. As a high school
senior, Carter edited and published
his own little magazine, Spearhead;
so he was well prepared for the
editorship at Washington and Lee.

Assisting and advising the stu-
dents, a faculty committee of four
has given much time and thought
‘0 the publication. Professors Mar-
Shall W. Fishwick, Ashley Brown,
Marvin B. Perry, Jr., and James

- Farrar are serving currently in
this Capacity. The first two have
ene so since the magazine’s in-
“€ption, while the latter two mem-

By MarsHau. W. FisHwick

 

bers were added this fall as re-
placements.

The summer, 1952, issue of
Shenandoah undertook an exami-
nation of the agrarian philosophy,
and published the views of seven of
the contributors to the now famous
lll Take My Stand, which was
published in 1930. These were
John Crowe Ransom, Donald
Davidson, Frank Owsley, Allen
Tate, H. C. Nixon, Andrew Lytle,
and John D. Wade. Interest in the
issue was so great that a New
York distributor was engaged to
handle the magazine in the met-
ropolitan area. The staff continues
to get letters and inquiries about
the issue, which played an import-
ant part in Shenandoah’s being se-
lected for the Bryher Foundation
award.

The new fall issue, the largest
and most diverse to date, aroused
much campus comment when it
was distributed in late November.
Among the contributors is William
Faulkner, Nobel prize winner in
literature, who reviews’ Ernest
Hemingway’s latest novel, The Old
Man and the Sea. Another inter-
nationally known author featured
is Ezra Pound, frequently contro-
versial figure who has long influ-
enced American writing. We can’t
say Pound defended Fascism: le-
gally he didn’t. The essay in Shen-
andoah is on James Joyce, and was
first published in the 1920's in a
French quarterly. It has been re-
edited by Pound, and now appears
for the first time in any English-
language publication, as “James
Joyce and Pecuchet.” Pound won
the Bollingen Prize for Poetry in
1948. The introductory essay to
the piece is done by Hugh Kenner,
held to be one of the greatest liv-
ing authorities on James Joyce.

One of America’s best-known
poets, Wallace Stevens, has also

YASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

contributed to the fall issue, as
have fiction experts August Der-
leth and Ray Bradbury. As always,
local talent has been utilized in the
magazine. Dean James G. Leyburn
is author of a long review of two
recent books by David Riesman:
The Lonely Crowd, A Study of
the Changing American Character
(1951) and Faces in the Crowd,
Individual Studies in Character and
Politics (1952). Dr. E. D. Myers,
head of the philosophy department,
comments on Reinhold Neibuhr’s
The lrony of American History,
while Editor Carter reviews a new
book of Faulkner criticism. Mr.
Carter has noted that this issue
represents the magazine’s most de-
termined and successful attempt
to publish a complete and mature
issue, one that can compare very
favorably with issues of established
quarterlies anywhere in the nation.

One of the most encouraging
things about Shenandoah is the
enthusiasm and support it has so-
licited from a sizeable group of
students at the University. They
have seen what an opportunity it
gives them to have their serious
efforts published, and read by a
national audience; and they have
seen how much Shenandoah will
mean as a device to center cultural
interest on the University and its
activities. The growing number of
contributions, and inquiries from
all over the country point up this
fact—Shenandoah may be one of
the most significant innovations
made at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity during this critical decade.

The printing of all issues to date
has been done on the campus at
Washington and Lee’s Journalism
Laboratory Press under the super-
vision of Mr. C. Harold Lauck.

The circulation staff is anxious
to get additional subscriptions, at
$1.25 yer year. These may be sent
to Box 722, Lexington, Virginia.

The Shoeless Wonders with Coach Blackburn

Attorney JosepH E. BLack-
BURN, Lynchburg, Virginia, is, be-
lieve it or not, a coach whose team
hasn’t lost a game since it began
playing in 1950. Not only is his
team undefeated and untied in
more than 20 games, but they play
barefooted—yet’s that’s right—no
shoes at all, even in the kickoff.

The team of the Presbyterian
Lynchburg Home began playing
together in 1950 and haven’t lost a
game in two years in Lynchburg
City League competition and in
numerous games against elevens
from other cities. It’s a throwback
to the old days when the Shoeless
Wonders played for the Presby-
terian Home and hadn’t lost a game
until they donned shoes. They are
adept at blasting a toe against the
ball and coming away unharmed
and without even a red mark to
show for it.

The Shoeless Wonders played
in the 85-pound Lynchburg City
League in 1950 and jumped into
the 95-pound class last session.
Both years it wasn’t beaten and
only scored against in one game.
They were not in the Lynchburg
City League this season because
they couldn’t make the weight

Blackburn refuses to single out
any player on the team as out-

THE ALUMNI MAGAZE

 

Resume of Fall Sports

Carl Wise’s first year as head
coach for the Washington and
Lee Generals could not be termed a
successful one from looking at the
won-lost record. The 1952 eleven

won only three games while losing

seven.

There are several good reasons
for this reversal of form follow-
ing Barclay’s outstanding seasons.
First, the team played a heavy
schedule, opening with Duke,
which helped to break the team’s
back with a 34-0 lashing before the
season was even underway. Sec-
ondly, injuries plagued the Gen-
erals from the very start. By the
season’s finale against the Univer-
sity of Virginia four players had
broken hands, one had a broken
leg, two had broken noses, two
had concussions, one had a dislo-
cated elbow, one had a torn liga-
ment in his knee, two had sprained
ankles, and one had a badly gashed
hand—a total of 14 injuries among
the first 25 men. Thirdly, the loss
of All-Southern Conference quar-
terback Gil Bocetti, who sparked
the team the previous three years,
proved to be a costly one. And
last—the Big Blue had ability and
spirit but they were just  out-
manned.

Following the disastrous Duke
opener the Generals bounced back
to shellac Davidson 33-14. George
Washington crashed the Big Blue’s
pass defense in the second half to
beat the Generals 33-28. Richmond
almost upset the Generals, capital-
zing on the weak pass defense ex-
Posed in the G-W game, but place
Kicking made the difference and
the locals won 21-20. West Vir-
sina gained sweet revenge for
Previous defeats and whipped the

€nerals 31-13.

c The Homecoming game with

PI was one of the most thrilling
“Yer seen on Wilson field. Coming
fom behind three times the Big

lue finally won 34-27. The Van-

derbilt game is still spoken of in
hushed whispers on the W&L cam-
pus. The Generals lost, 67-6. Still
smarting from their wounds the
Big Blue let an underdog North
Carolina State eleven take their
measure 25-14. Cincinnatti, 14-14
equalizers of national powerhouse
‘Tulsa, walloped the Generals 54-0.

It was a bruised, badly bat-
tered underdog — an _ underesti-
mated Washington and Lee eleven
that met Virginia’s high flying Wa-
hoos for the last game held in Scott
Stadium. A crowd of 14,000
looked on in silence during the
first half as a small band of faith-
ful General rooters cheered Wash-
ington and Lee to a 7-0 lead. In
the second half the undermanned
Generals finally succumbed to the
Cavaliers’ host of talented backs,
21-14.

On the brighter side of this
year’s picture, Wes Abrams and
Randy Broyles finished first and
second in Southern Conference
rushing.

Generals.

Prospects are good for next
year’s eleven with 18 of the first
22 returning, including 11 who
will only be juniors.

* * *

This fall’s edition of the cross-
country team fared no better than
did the other sports.

‘The Harriers opened with an en-
couraging 20-42 victory over
Hampden-Sydney, but followed
with an 18-39 loss to Bridgewater.
Davidson walloped the local boys
15-46. (Low score wins in this
sport. )

The Big Six match found Wash-
ington and Lee coming in fourth
with 93 points. The Harriers won
the next two with a 25-33 win
over Roanoke and a 20-37 wallop-
ing of Lynchburg.

A ninth place in the Southern
Conference meet finished the season
for the team.

Coach Dick Miller said the team

15

improved rapidly during the sea-
son, but was hampered through in-
experience and lack of knowledge
concerning pavement running on
several “away” meets. The major-
ity of the team were freshmen and
prospects are most encouraging for
the next three years.

* * *

The 1952 edition of the Gen-
erals’ soccer team won 2 and lost 7,
for an unsuccessful season.

The “Booters” started with a
close 2-0 loss to Virginia, followed
by a 4-0 walloping from the Uni-
versity of Baltimore, national pow-
erhouse. Maryland’s _ ball-kickers
were given the fright of their life,
but the Terps finally eked out a
3-2 victory in the waning minutes
of the game.

Coming within their own class
for the first time the booters de-
feated Roanoke College, 3-1. North
Carolina and North Carolina State
defeated the Generals 1-0, and 3-2.

Roanoke College was met and
defeated for the second time 3-2.
Duke walloped the local team, 9-1.

The season’s finale against the Wa-
hoos of Virginia was a thriller. In
an extremely rough game the Cav-
aliers kicked out a 5-3 victory over
the local team.

Coach Ben Collins says pros-
pects should be better for next year
since many of the players are only
freshmen. The booters were ham-
pered by the early season loss of
potential All-American goalie, Car]
Rumpp, because of an injury.

Only four lettermen greeted
Coach Billy McCann on the first
day of practice for the 1952-53
Washington and Lee_ basketball
team.

Ben Walden, 6-3 guard; Jim
Rich, 6-4 center; Bill Scott, 5-11
guard; and Charlie Topp, promis-
ing 6-2 forward; are slated to carry
the major part of the load this year.
Several promising freshmen and
sophomores will help plenty. Fresh-
man John Schenkel, a promising
6-5 center from Pennsylvania, is
expected to push Rich hard for the
center position. Paul McCoy, 6-

=

THE 1952 COACHING STAFF

foot freshman guard, will] Probal
see a lot of action.

Bob Pfaff, a 5-10 sophomo,
guard, is expected to make up fi
his lack of size with speed 4,
hustle. John Huddle, 6-2 soph
more forward, is expected to ,
action, and others from the gs
of 20 will undoubtedly show pre
ise before the season is over.

The squad is young and ine
perienced. Six members being
years old, and eight more 19,

Coach McCann isn’t overly ¢
timistic about his chances for
winning team for his first year
coach of “Minkland.” However,
reports with a smile, “We shox
win a few.”

There aren’s any individual st:
on the team that can possibly e¢
pare with last year’s all-time
Jay Handlan, but according to
Cann the squad shows “spirit” ai
“they want to win.”
