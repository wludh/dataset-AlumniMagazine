ABOUT THE COVER

The Washington and Lee Mock Convention was inaugurated

in 1908. The parade feature of this event is something new

that has been added. It was begun in 1948 and repeated this

year. Our cover shows one of the many State floats. Note

They Liked Ike at the ‘52 Convention

News item—Washington and
Lee’s 1952 Republican National
Mock Convention nominated Gen-
eral Dwight D. Eisenhower as the
Republican Party’s _ presidential
candidate, and Governor Earl E.
Warren of California as his run-
ning mate.

* * *

The 1952 Republican National
Mock Convention, held at Wash-
ington and Lee April 28 and 29,
was the biggest thing to hit the
campus in many a year.

First of all it came at a time
when, more than ever before, the
person elected to the Presidency
of the United States will have an
important effect upon the destiny
of the world. It came at a time
when, according to all reports, the
country can expect a change in ad-
ministrations. And it came at a
time of political strife within the
Republican Party between the fol-
lowers of Taft and Eisenhower.

Secondly, the convention fea-
tured the largest and longest pa-
rade in the convention’s 44-year
history. More than sixty floats
represented the forty-eight states,
the five territories, and the District
of Columbia. Bands from V.P.L.,

‘
,

roe aa Ae ae

V.M.I., Hargrave Military Acad-
emy, Greenbrier Military School,
Parry-McCluer High School of
Buena Vista, and Augusta Mili-
tary Academy, were in the proces-
sion along with student orchestras
and hill-billy bands. ‘The Augusta
Roller’s Rifles, crack drill team,
was on hand. Students remarked
that there were more beautiful fe-

set this year.

Third, the ninth convention was
the best publicised in the school’s
history. For the first time it was
televised. Edward R. Murrow,
prominent news commentator and
director of news events for the
Columbia Broadcasting System,
recorded the highlights of the elec-
tion and used them as the highlight
of his “See It Now” television pro-
eram. Approximately 45  repre-
sentatives of communication media
were on hand for the event. Re-
porters and photographers from
Virginia newspapers, radio an-
nouncers, wire-service feature
writers, Washington correspon-
dents, newsreel cameramen and
network forecasters covered the
two-day event.

And fourth, the convention had
excellent student leadership. Town-
send Oast, freshman law student
from Portsmouth, Virginia, served
as chairman, a job that took all
year to prepare for. ‘Tom Shepherd,
senior law student from Wash-

3

ington, D. C, served as secretary.
These two men performed an out-
standing job of handling the ros-
trum in a business-like manner.
State delegation heads kept con-
stant check with the political trends
of their representative states, and
voted accordingly. Voting was as
accurate a picture as could possi-
bly have been made.

The convention itself, after the
first outburst of student exub-
erance had worn off, took on a
surprisingly serious air. Senator
Frank Carlson (R-Kansas), sub-
stituting for Senator James H.
Duff, (R-Pa.) who became ill at
the last minute, was the keynote
speaker. Carlson said the Demo-
crats would not be easy to defeat,
regardless of their administrative
blunders, as that party has more
members than the Republican
party. He stated 10,000,000 inde-
pendent voters were needed to
swing the election and called for a
candidate who would appeal to
these on-the-fence voters. In speak-
ing of the present administration
Carlson said, “Here is corruption
rampant. Here is a wilderness into
which we have been led by the
policies, or rather the lack of them,
of the Democrats . . . Here I see the

A

taxpayer as a citizen second class,
an object of exploitation, even
mockery.”

In addition to Eisenhower and
Taft, Governor Warren, General
Douglas MacArthur, Harold Stas-
sen, Warren Austin, Senator Mil-
liken (Colo.) and Governor Theo-
dore R. McKeldin of Maryland
were nominated by the student del-
egations. Voting was tense through
the first three ballots, pre-conven-
tion student predictions being
evenly

divided between E/isen-

hower and Taft. But it soon be-
came apparent that Warren’s votes
held the key to the convention
and nobody was surprised when, on
the fourth ballot, Warren threw
his votes to Eisenhower and the
General suddenly landslided into
the nomination.

On the first ballot Taft grabbed
the lead with 484 votes to Eisen.
hower’s 407. Warren showed sur-
prising strength with 189. On the
second ballot Eisenhower took
over many of the favored sons’
votes to move into a 425-507 lead
with Warren dropping to 103.
California stuck to Warren who
on the third ballot kept 102 votes,
while Eisenhower with 650 and
Taft with 543, climbed steadily
towards the 603 majority neces-
sary to carry the nomination. On
the fourth ballot California, and
other states, passed. The Virgin
Islands changed its one vote from
Taft to Eisenhower giving the Ike
forces 602 votes. Then the Cali-
fornia chairman read a telegram
from Warren freeing them from
their vote, and the resulting 70
vote deluge for Eisenhower swung
the nomination. The vote was
made unanimous in the interest of
a unified party at election time.

In the Vice-Presidential race
Warren was nominated on the first

ballot with McKeldin of Maryland

The convention was enlivened
by challenges and arguments from
the floor, the Lexington Civic
Band (W. and L. ROTC Band),
student orchestras, demonstrations,
confetti, snake dances, and two
miniature atomic bombs set off
by the New Mexico delegation.

Political leaders throughout the
country appeared to pay much at-
tention to the results of the elec-
tion. The Roanoke Times of May
1, said in an editorial, “The na-
tional convention in July may well
turn out to be an exact duplica-
tion of the W. and L. mock con-
vention so far as the outcome is
concerned, if not from start to
finish.”

The Richmond Times-Dispatch
had half a page display on May
4, backing up the significance of
the student convention, but perhaps
the strongest testimony of all con-
cerning the importance of the event
can be taken from the reaction of
the Republican leaders.

Senator Carlson, keynote speak-
er, said, “hese young men have
undertaken and accomplished a
splendid thing. The method which

 

Florida sunshine visits Lexington

they employed is bound to have
significant results.”

Robert H. Woods, Virginia
GOP chairman: “The W. and L.
mock convention beats anything
I’ve ever seen or heard. I’ve at-
tended four national conventions
but this beats them all for spirit.
Their work is commendable.”

United States Senator Henry
Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts,

 

Officials in a relaxed moment

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

campaign director for General
Eisenhower: “The decision of the
convention at W. and L. parallels
that of young college men and
women the country over. It pleases
us and undoubtedly indicates a
trend.”

Virginia State Senator Ted Dal-
ton: “It is great to see young men
taking an active interest in poli-
tics. After all, they are the ones in
whose hands the future of the na-
tion must rest. Their findings are
certainly based on conscientious
work.”

The “Minks” have been correct
in their choice for the presidential
candidates five times since its be-
ginning in 1908.

The mock convention, always
that of the party out of power, be-
evan in Lexington with the nomi-
nation of William Jennings Bryan
in 1908. It missed Wilson in 1912
but picked Hughes correctly in
1916. No convention was held in
1920 because of the war aftermath,
but in 1924 the students resumed
by correctly nominating John W.
Davis, a graduate of W. and L.
The students were right again in
1928 and 1932, picking Al Smith
and Franklin D. Roosevelt. ‘They
missed in 1936 by picking Senator

5

 

A

Senator Frank Carlson (R-Kansas), keynoter, was impressive

Vandenberg over Alf Landon, and
in 1940 they were wrong again
in nominating Charles McNarry
instead of Wendell Wilkie. No con-
vention was held in 1944 while
the 1948 nominated
Arthur Vandenberg instead of
Thomas E. Dewey.

The convention is an education
in itself for the students. Correct
balloting procedure is followed,
and political intrigue is the order of
the day. Although the students
themselves make all arrangements,
they are advised on technical mat-
ters by members of the political

conclave

science, history, and law faculties.

Needless to say, students who
attended this convention will be
hanging by their radios this sum-
mer to see how closely the national
convention will follow their own.
And they'll have an amazing store
of knowledge about which way
the various states will swing, and
of the behind-the-scenes maneuvy-
ering.

One important aspect not cover-
ed so far was of vital concern to
the students. Classes were suspend-
ed for two afternoons and a morn-

ing!

 

Fitteen Years Later

IQ

By PArKE Rouse, Jr., 37

Fifteen years ago, as a senior
at Washington and Lee, I circu-
lated my classmates a
questionnaire designed to record
their reaction to the school life
they were leaving and to the world
which lay ahead of them. The re-
sults were interesting and perhaps

among

in some respects useful. Re-read
today, it creat
changes have taken place in our
thinking in the past decade and a
half. And so it has occurred to me

suggests that

6

that a re-survey and a comparison
of results might be worthwhile this
year, so drastically different from
the 1937 world into which we
stepped from the campus, with Dr.
Gaines’ salutatory ringing in our
memory.

I have accordingly reconstructed
the questions asked in 1937 as ac-
curately as possible and added
others to bring the record up to
date. The Alumni Office has mim-
eographed and mailed the question-

naire to 135 class members, in-
cluding both academic and law
graduates, whose length of stay
at Washington and Lee ranged
from two to six years. Fifty-eight
of the 135 replied in time to be
included in this tabulation, as com-
pared with 75 whose views were
recorded in the 1937 survey. And
whereas the technique used is ad-
mittedly not completely scientific,
certain similarities between the
results in 1937 and 1952 indicate
that a measure of accuracy has
been achieved.

The most startling contrasts oc-
cur in the realm of political belief.
In 1937, more than half of the
students replying favored socialism
“as a desirable eventuality in
American government.” But in
1952 all of the men who answered
think otherwise, including the ten
who approve the Truman Fair
Deal in greater or lesser degree
and the ten—mostly the same ten
men—who voted for Truman in
the last presidential election.
(Thirty-two others voted for Dew-
ey, three for Thurmond, and one
for Norman Thomas. The others
couldn’t or didn’t vote.) Political
scientists might well note this
change, as well as the fact that
whereas only 17 of 75 students
in 1937 expressed willingness to
fight in a foreign war, nearly all
members of the class of ’°37 saw
military service in World War II.

Inflation and a higher standard
of living also show up plainly in
the comparison of 1937 and 1952.
In the earlier year the seniors’ es-
timates of the “amount you expect
to make at the height of your ca-
reer” averaged $10,000, where-
as the average income from their
work of the 50 men who an-
swered this question in 1952 was
$10,166, ranging from a low of
$3,500 to a high of $35,000.
‘The same men had an average
income of $1,557 in addition to
earnings from their work. When
it is remembered that the class
members now average only 38 or
39 years and have another 15 years
to go before they presumably reach

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

their maximum earning power, it
would appear that the ’37’s have
already exceeded their financial
expectations. But if the decline
of the purchasing power of the
dollar and the higher level of tax-
ation are taken into account, it
can be seen that the $10,000 of
1952 is hardly the luxurious $10,-
000 which the seniors of ’37 en-
visioned.

The class of °37 is today much
more aware of the political and
economic developments than it was
in college, judging by its news-
paper reading habit. In those days
only 77 per cent read a newspaper
regularly and not all of those fol-
lowed national and foreign news.
In comparison all except one of
the men polled this year read a
paper regularly, and all of these
affirm that they keep up with the
world news and editorials. Four-
teen of them, scattered across the
country, regularly read the excel-
lent coverage of The New York
Times and eight, The Herald Tri-
bune. Readership of the comics
lags behind the news in spite of
the very evident popularity with
the °37’s of Pogo, the Eisenhower
of the comic strips.

It is a wry fact that the °37
graduate reads for pleasure more
books (average: 15 a year) than
he did when in college (average:
10 a year), and keeps up with more
magazines (average: 4). Life is
his favorite (62 per cent) closely
followed by Time (58 per cent),
Readers Digest (32 per cent), the
Saturday Evening Post (20 per
cent), Newsweek, The New
Yorker, U. S. News and World
Report, Colliers, Fortune, National
Geographic, Cosmopolitan, and
other staples. Spicy Detective,
which titillated six of the class as
undergraduates, has lost its grip,
or its spice.

The Average ’37 Man has also
less appetite for the movies, per-
haps the result of the high cost of
baby sitters or perhaps of the low
calibre of current pictures. Where-
as he saw 55 films in 1937, he
estimates he saw only six in 1951.

“Don’t forget they’ve invented tel-
evision,” notes one non-moviegoer.
But his church attendance has im-
proved in the past 15 years. Fifty-
one percent of those replying at-
tend fairly regularly, whereas only
24. per cent did as undergraduates.
Ninety-one percent are now church
members as compared with 76 per
cent then. Undoubtedly matrimony
(91 per cent) and children (74
per cent) have had a_ favorable
effect on old ’37’s spiritual life.

To round out the picture, the
1952 survey revealed that °37 has
two children; that he carries $27,-
627 of life insurance and that he
has one automobile and owns or
is paying off the mortgage on a
home. In view of the high average
incomes, it is perhaps notable that
43 per cent of the class lives in
rented dwellings.

Turning to the Old Grad’s re-
lationship with his Alma Mater,
one finds his enthusiasm generally
undimmed at the 15-year mark.
He still is of the opinion that
Washington and Lee offered the
education he needed (89 per cent
said so); still feels he could not
have derived equal benefit from
four years’ work (89 per cent said
so); still would choose to go to
W. and L. (86 per cent said so).
He contributes at least now and
then to his class fund (74 per cent),
and would do so more often but for
laziness, procrastination, forget-
fulness, apathy, economy, neglect,
other resonsibilities, two children,
five children, or an objection to
W. and L. athletic policy. If he
had the money he would contribute
to his university’s endowment; 83
per cent of the men polled said so.
The same percentage uncondition-
ally would send their sons to Wash-
ington and Lee, and the rest would
leave the decision to their sons or
would choose other institutions on
the basis of curricular offerings,
church-college affiliation, nearness,
or lower costs.

In general, these replies cor-
respond with the answers which the
same group gave 15 years ago.
There was one interesting excep-

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

tion: in 1937 only 33 per cent
showed enough interest in Wash-
ington and Lee’s existence to ex-
press a willingness, when able, to
contribute to its endowment. It is
a hopeful augury that 83 per cent
today would contribute if they
could and that 74 per cent give
to their class fund, at least oc-
cassionally.

This does not mean that the
men polled are uncritical of Wash-
ington and Lee. Campus politics
impresses the class agent as the
worst weakness, as in 1937, fol-
lowed by intercollegiate athletics.
The development of graduate work
and the placing of more emphasis
on scholarships were cited as the
most needed changes of a list of
nine provided by the questionnaire.

(From the same alternatives in

1937 the class recommended the
addition of more seminar or honors
courses, a movement which has
lately advanced at W. and L.) But
all of the graduates, looking back
today, put the interests of Wash-
ington and Lee above those of
their fraternity, whereas in 1937
only 80 per cent did so, by their
own admission.

As a revelation of the many
changes in political and economic
matters which have occurred in
the past 15 years, the re-survey of
the class of 1937 was well worth
the time it consumed. Admittedly,
the inadequacy of the original sur-
vey offered no basis for compar-
ing some of the most interesting
current findings. (Perhaps a
thorough job of probing alumni
opinion would prove worthwhile
for the Alumni Office, or for cer-
tain courses.) But enough has been
done to show that a representative
group of Washington and Lee
alumni compares favorably with
college alumni in general, as de-
picted in the current book, They
Went to College, which resulted
from the extensive Time-Life stu-
dies. It also reflects in several ways
a growth of responsibility, curios-
ity, and spiritual awareness among
these men since those carefree col-

An Active Fine Arts Department

Washington and Lee has always
been noted as a liberal arts school,
devoted to giving students a cul-
tural background and a general
education rather than a strictly
specialized education. However, it
has only been in recent years that
the Fine Arts Department has been
developed. As part of their liberal
education students are now re-
quired to take six hours in either
this department or in philosophy.
A large number take Fine Arts

courses.

The department is divided into
two sections: music and art. Oldest
section is the music department. It
was established in 1936 by the
late Professor John A. Graham,
formerly professor of romance
languages at W. and L. and a
composer in his own right. Classes
were held in the living room of his
home and later moved to the
Student Union. The University
purchased four albums and a vic-
trola to aid the embryo music
lovers.

In 1940 the Carnegie Founda-
tion gave the school a large phono-
graph and a basic set of recordings
and scores. At this same time the
Anderson Music Room was opened
on the second floor of McCormick
Library, giving the department a
classroom.

Since then the University has
eradually acquired a large collec-
tion of records and scores which is
classed as one of the outstanding
and most complete collections in
the country. The records on hand
may be divided into five groups:
the Carnegie unit; the acoustic rec-
ords, a rare and valuable collec-
tion of vocal records given the de-
partment by Professor LeConte
Stevens; a collection of records in-
herited from Professor Graham;
and 45 albums contributed by stu-
dents, plus new long-playing rec-
ords contributed by the University.

The music course itself is

By J. W. BENJAMIN, 754

limited to about twenty students
per year, plus many who audit, or
“sit-in-on” sessions. It is a course
for the layman in music apprecia-
tion, no previous knowledge of
music being necessary. Mr. Steph-
enson, Assistant Professor of Ger-
man, teaches the class. A large
number of assignments consist of
listening to records in the sound-
proof record booths in Anderson
Room. The records and the phono-

 

graphs are open to students at all
times.

In conjunction with the music
department it might be interesting
to note the formation of a new stu-
dent organization on campus, the
Washington and Lee Concert
Guild. In the last three years this
organization has presented a dozen
concerts to the student body, in-
cluding everything from jazz and
string quartets to an opera, The
Telephone, and the Apollo Boys
Choir. The concerts are usually
free of charge, the organization

being supported primarily by do-
nations from interested persons.
Ken Rockwell of Asheville, N. C.,
served as president this year.

In addition, the Rockbridge
County Concert Series is open to
students. They present at least
four outstanding events yearly.

The Art Department is more
recent. Although classes were held
prior to 1949 it was in that year,
with the arrival of Dr. Marion
Junkin, that it began to grow and
gain student interest. Dr. Junkin,
a W. and L. graduate, had pre-
viously established an art depart-
ment for Vanderbilt University and
served as Assistant Director of the
Richmond School of Art. He has
exhibited his oils and water colors
at two one-man shows in New
York and in numerous exhibitions
abroad and in the United States.
A number of his works are in mu-
seums and private galleries.

The art section offers a variety
of courses from “History of Mod-
ern Art,” to “Renaissance Art in
Northern Europe,” In _ addition,
courses in creative painting and
drawing are offered. The class-
room, located in McCormick Li-
brary, has slides, projectors, ma-
terials for study, and the Carnegie
Collection of Prints. Two especially
lighted exhibition rooms for the dis-
play of loan collections and sculp-
ture are in use, many loans being
obtained yearly from the Virginia
Museum of Fine Arts, the Met-
ropolitan Museum, and the Mod-
ern Museum of Art of New York.

Among the artistic assets of the
University are an oil portrait of
Washington as a colonial colonel, a
portrait of Lafayette (both painted
by Charles Peale, famous Ameri-
can colonial painter); Valentine’s
recumbent statute of Lee; the Lee
collection of American portraits in
oil; a handsome wooden statue
of Washington carved by a local
woodworker in the early nine-
teenth century; and the Vincent L.
Bradford collection of oil paintings.

To aid in the interesting of stu-
dents in art a lending library has
been established. More than fifty

prints and originals are available
for students who may check them
out just as they would a library
book. The pictures may be taken
to the student’s room and hung,
to be studied at leisure.

An impressive addition to the
Fine Arts Department is the newly
completed 340 square foot fresco
mural in the basement of the Li-
brary. Dr. Junkin, who has placed
his signature in the lower right-
hand coner of the painting, spent
a year of work and study on the
project, even going to Mexico last
summer to study methods of
fresco painting. The pigments were
applied over fresh plaster, and thus
by penetrating, became part of the
wall itself.

Theme of the mural is man’s
right to free his mind from perse-
cution, fear, and superstition. The
wall is divided into five distinct
panels which blend into each other
as the pageant of history pro-
eresses. The first part deals with
primitive man, depicted by masks,
totem poles, and a stone wet with
blood of a human sacrifice, woven
into a pattern of briliant color. The
second part, dealing with Greek
thought, shows Socrates drinking
his hemlock. The third section is
dramatically introduced by the
crucifixion of Christ, represented
by a single arm and hand pierced
with a huge nail. The rest of this
section symbolizes the misuse of
Jesus’ ideas and shows men _ be-
ing tortured for their study of
science. Next appears the “theme
of revolution.” Here Voltaire and
Jefferson contributed to the break-
ing of the medieval fetters of free
thought. Voltaire’s famous _ slo-
gan, “E’crasez fame” (crush the
evil thing), is the final word be-
fore the modern theme is intro-
duced. The first part of the final
section introduces many of the
great advances of our times in
science, art, and politics. The sec-
ond part of the last section, done
entirely in black and white to
symbolize the negative side of
modern civilization, Dr. Junkin
calls, “the age of propaganda.”

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Here is noted man’s preoccupation
with sex, war, comic books, tele-
vision, and material life. The mural
ends with a final burst of satire
with man escaping his troubles by
taking a rocket ship to the moon.

School officials say that interest
in art and music has increased
three-fold among students since
the war. The University hopes,
through curricular and extra cur-
ricular activities to increase the
W. and L. students’ knowledge and
enjoyment of the great art and
music which is a part of the natural
heritage of the citizens of the

Western World.

 

Alumni in Symphony

The Atlanta Symphony, as a
full- fledged orchestra, is only five

Fifteen Years Later

lege days. Finally—and to the ad-
vantage of Washington and Lee—
it indicates that the men of 1937
realize what a blessing they en-
joyed in coming under the influence
of this remarkable institution in
the years when their ambitions
were shaped and their characters
influenced. This realization is the
foundation on which Washington
and Lee as a non-State, non-de-
nominational, liberal arts college
must survive and it is encouraging
to see that many of those who
benefitted from what Washington
and Lee offered them have re-
solved that their sons and other
future generations shall enjoy those
same intangible values.

650 Delegates Attend SIPA

The 1952 Southern Interscho-
lastic Press Association’s Conven-
tion was the biggest in its twenty-
three year history. Over 230 news-
papers, yearbooks, magazines, and
radio programs from 120 schools
were entered in the publication
contest held in connection with
the three day session. More than
650 high school editors, staff edi-
tors, staff members, and advisors
attended the convention. Some
came from as far away as Texas
and Florida to hear professional
experts in Journalism, television,
and radio.

The convention, held May 1, 2,
3, this year, is sponsored yearly by
Washington and Lee’s Lee Mem-
orial Journalism Foundation. Pur-
pose of the three-ring press circus
is to give promising young journal-
ists from all over the south a chance
to meet each other and discuss mu-
tual problems. Delegates are given
constructive professional criticism
on their school publications, and
are given an opportunity to dis-
cuss practical problems and voca-

SIPA session in Lee Chapel

tions with noted experts in the field
of communications. While attend-
ing the convention delegates hear
speeches by outstanding people.

Professor O. W. Riegel, SIPA
Director, and his assistant, Charles
O. Voigt, feel that the convention
helps to inspire and encourage the
journalism aspirations of the dele-
gates, and that journalism as a
whole gains prestige and_better-
ment through the program. In ad-
dition, W. and L. journalism ma-
jors and Sigma Delta Chi (Na-
tional Honorary Journalism Fra-
ternity) help with the convention
and gain much valuable experi-
ence. And also, everyone always
has a good time.

This year’s session was high-
lighted by speeches and round-
table discussions. John Scott,
author and foreign editor for Time
magazine; Elliott Caplin and John
Murphy, producers of the comic
strip, “Big Ben”; Max Fullerton,
Chief of the Baltimore Bureau of
the Associated Press; and John Dos
Passos, noted author, were among

RS

those who spoke to the delegates.
In addition a tremendous number
of round-table discussions and
formal talks were conducted by ex-
perts. The young delegates took
their choice of these informal
gatherings, depending upon their
individual interests. There was
something on hand for everybody.
Some of the meetings had as many
as 200 delegates in attendance.

Two banquets were held. The
first, held on Friday night, May
2, at the Mayflower Hotel, was
the annual Quill and Scroll ban-
quet. The second was held on Sat-
urday night in the dining room at
VMI. Dr. Gaines, President of
W. and L., and Carl Knight,
President of the Virginia Press
Association, spoke prior to the pre-
sentation of 230 awards to various
publications, including 14 first
place winners.

To add variety to the fully
packed program a current events
contest was held, an SIPA presi-
dent was elected, a trip to Natural
Bridge for interested delegates was
arranged, a track meet was held
on Wilson field and a_ baseball
game at VMI, a variety show was
presented by talented W. and L.
students, and a special issue of the
local collegiate newspaper, The
Ring-tum Phi, was published. Big-
gest event for many of the dele-
gates was the big semi-formal
SIPA dance held Friday night in
Doremus Gymnasium.

The convention climaxed a big
week for the University as the
Mock Convention had just been
held the preceding Monday and
Tuesday. Weather for the weekend
was perfect and many students
pronounced the SIPA to be the
best thing to come to W. and L.
all year. For three wonderful days
the local campus turned co-ed, and
students sat on the campus or on
the fraternity lawns and watched
the passing parade.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

Law Alumni Organize

The idea of a Law School As-
sociation originated with a small
group of alumni who were con-
cerned about the means of focus-
ing the interest of practicing grad-
uates upon the work and problems
of the Law School, and who were
also impressed with the success in
this direction of similar organiza-
tions at other universities. The
matter was informally discussed
and studied by this group over a
considerable period of time, was
mentioned to Mr. Williams and
Dr. Gaines, and finally culminated
this spring in the enlistment of a
sort of organizing committee com-
posed of 50-odd lawyers in four
or five nearby cities. It was this
committee which met in Lexington
on ‘Tuesday, May 6, adopted a
Constitution, and elected the fol-
lowing officers:

President, Martin P. Burks;
Vice-President, Carter Glass, III;
Secretary-Treasurer, E. McGruder
Faris, Jr.

Members of Council: 3 year
term, Walter EK. Hoffman, J. Ran-
dolph Tucker, Jr.; 2 year term,
Samuel H. Williams, Randolph G.
Whittle; 1 year term, R. S. Kime,
Paul C. Buford.

The officiers, and indeed, all of
the members of the organizing
committee, are from a handful of
Virginia cities. This resulted from
the fact that it was necessary to
recruit the first members from
places where there was consider-
able concentration of W. and L.
lawyers, many of whom would be
willing to make the trip to Lexing-
ton to attend the organizing meet-
ing. The object is to enlist the sup-
port of all Law School alumni and
it is earnestly hoped that our
alumni generally may become in-
terested so that the association
will be truly representative. Mem-
bership dues of $1.00 per year
for men who have been practicing
less than five years and $5.00 per
year for those with more than five

years practice should be mailed to
EK. McGruder Faris, Jr., Secretary-
‘Treasurer, care of W. and L. Law
School, Lexington, Va.

A copy of the Constitution

Many College Presidents in Gaines Family

Dr. FrANcIS PENDLETON

GAINES, JR., °39, oldest son of

the president of Washington and
Lee and Mrs. Gaines, has accepted
the presidency of Wofford College
in Spartanburg, South Carolina,
effective August 1, 1952.

Dr. Gaines, 33, who is now pro-
fessor of history and Dean of
Students at Southern Methodist
University, Dallas, Texas, was
reared on the campus of Wash-
ington and Lee. He was graduated
from Woodberry Forest, attended
Washington and Lee for two years,
and after an illness of three years,
was graduated from the University
of Arizona where he stood first in
his class.

He served four years during
World War II as an officer in the
Intelligence Corps, then took a
position as Dean of Men at Bir-
mingham Southern College. Subse-
quently he was professor of history

aS

Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines, Jr.

and director of development at the
University of Houston. He is mar-
ried to the former Dorothy Bloom-
hardt, whose father is professor
of history at Wittenberg College.

 

Dr. and Mrs. Gaines have two sons.

He is a member of Omicron
Delta Kappa, Phi Beta Kappa,
and the Raven Society of the Uni-
versity of Virginia, where he re-
ceived his M.A. and Ph.D. de-
grees, and Phi Kappa Sigma so-
cial fraternity.

Mrs. Francis P. Gaines, Sr.,
should be much at home among
college administrators. Her father
for more than thirty years was dean
of Mississippi State College. A
cousin, Dr. Andrew Kincannon,
was for a long time chancellor of
the University of Mississippi, and
another cousin, Dr. John F. Fant,
served as president of Mississippi
State College for Women. Her
brother, Dr. J. C. Robert, is pres-
ident of Coker College; her son, Dr.
Francis P. Gaines, Jr., as of Au-
gust 1, is president of Wofford Col-
lege; and her husband is president
of Washington and Lee University.

 

Sam Bell Steves
Elected Mayor

SAM BELL STEVEs was elected
Mayor of the City of San Antonio,
Texas, on March 6, 1952, by unan-
imous vote of the City Council.

An outstanding business man
himself, serving in many capacities
in the wide-spread Steves family
lumber connections, he belongs to
a pioneer family of city and region-
builders. Though a newcomer in
politics, he has served the com-
munity in various volunteer capac-
ities. Even so, he takes the mayor-
alty as a sort of heritage. Four
members of the family served be-
fore him: John Smith, a great-
oreat-great grandfather, was the
city’s first mayor. Later, Sam C.
Bell and Albert Steves, grand-
fathers, and John Tobin, a great
uncle, filled the office. Thus Mayor
Steves has both family and _ po-
litical traditions to uphold.

And speaking of traditions, the

12

Steves’ Washington and Lee tra-
dition goes back almost as far. His
orandfather, Albert Steves, was a
student here, 1874-77, making the

Dr. Edward Lund

(Continued from page 11)

Episcopal Church. Dr. Lund, Sr.,
was born in Sweden and later be-
came a naturalized American cit-
izen. He died in Lexington, Vir-
ginia, after retiring from the Epis-
copal ministry.

Dr. Lund received his prepara-
tory education at DeVaux Acad-
emy, Niagara Falls, N. Y., and en-
tered Washington and Lee where
he received the A.B. degree in
1933. He received a fellowship to
work toward his master’s degree
which he received in 1934, and
taught history and English here
from 1934 to 1938. He then went
to the University of Wisconsin to

work toward his Ph.D., which he
received in 1944, and while there
did some teaching, also serving as
professor of history in Wisconsin
State College, Superior, Wiscon-
sin. From 1944 to 1945 he studied
under a fellowship at Yale Univer-
sity, then returned to Wisconsin.
In 1946 Dr. Lund went to Flor-
ence, Alabama, State Teachers Col-
lege to head its history department,
and became dean of that school on
January 1, 1947.

In 1934 Dr. Lund was married
to Martha Louise Gray, who was a
student at Mary Baldwin College
in Staunton, Virginia, while he
was at Washington and Lee, just
35 miles away. They have a
daughter, Sigrid Gray, 13. His
brother, Dr. Douglas Lund, ’37,
lives in Florence, Alabama.

While at Washington and Lee
he was a member of Delta Upsilon
social fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa,
and honorary fraternities, Kappa
Phi Kappa, and ‘Tau Kappa Iota.

“Cap'n Dick” Retires from Coaching

“Cap’n Dick” Smith, Washing-
ton and Lee’s “Connie Mack,”
ended his 29-year tenure as _ base-
ball coach on May 19, as the Gen-
erals took the Big Six Champion-
ship with a record of five wins and
one loss.

The big rugged looking coach
began his career at Washington
and Lee as a star second baseman.
He is classed, along with Cy
Young, Gil Bocetti, and Jay
Handlan, as one of the all-time
athletic greats at the school. In
1923 he started coaching the
team, and became graduate man-
ager of athletics. In 1926 this title
was changed to “athletic director.”
Smith now has the longest tenure
in an athletic department in the
Southern Conference.

During his 29-year hitch, “Cap’n
Dick” won one Southern Confer-
ence championship and several Big
Six titles. Emerson Dickman, Bos-
ton Red Sox hurler during the
mid-1930’s, was developed at W.
and L. under Smith’s tutelage.
“Cap’n Dick” believes Dickman to
be the finest pitcher the Generals
ever had, while he rates former

By J. W. BENJAMIN, 754

W. and L. first baseman Harry
Fitzgerald as the finest long-ball
hitter he ever coached.

Smith announced his retirement
from the coaching lines earlier this
year, giving for a reason that he
couldn’t give the necessary time
to the sport. Replacing the old
mentor will be Bill McCann,
former star at the University of
Virginia, who will also coach
basketball next year.

Players state they will sorely
miss the balding fire-ball who sat
at the extreme right on the bench
for 29 years. Wearing an old blue
hat and sweater, “Cap’n Dick”
was famous for his constant pep
and his “use your own judgment
men, use your own judgment.”
Skilled as a_ baseball tactician,
Smith loved “inside baseball.” He
was especially noted for his squeeze
plays.

“Cap’n Dick” will continue as
athletic director, but he states he
will miss being coach due to his
deep love for the game and the

«

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

enjoyment of being around the
boys.

In other news from the spring
sports season, Ben Collins didn’t
fare so well in his first year as la-
crosse coach. The Generals posted
a 5-8 record. The track team was
hampered by lack of a permanent
coach and of interested personnel.
They lost all matches, but consid-
ering their lack of depth and time
for training they turned in a re-
markable record of courage and
faithfulness. The golf team broke
even with a 4-4 record and one
tie. They also placed second in a
triangular match. The tennis team,
under the mentoring of student
coach Ken Rockwell, also broke
even with a 7-7 record.

Best record for the spring was
held by the baseball team who had
an 11-8 record, won the Big Six
Championship, and defeated the
University of Virginia in the sea-
son’s finale.

Coaching the Generals in this
game was Cy Young. Cy used three
pitchers in holding the hard hitting
Wahoos to 3 runs while the Big
Blue scored 5.

 

 

 

Dr. S. C. Lind, ’99

Dr. S. C. Lind Reaps Awards

At an age when most men are
retired and puttering around in
a garden, Dr. Samuel Colville
Lind, B.A. ’99, Phi Beta Kappa,
is still picking up awards in his
chosen field—chemistry.

The 72-year-old atomic scien-
tist’s latest is the 1952 Priestly
Medal, highest honor of the Amer-
ican Chemical Society, which will
be conferred upon Dr. Lind at the
Atlantic City meeting of the Amer-
ican Society next September.

Dr. Lind has multiple duties
at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He is
acting director of the chemistry
division at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, research consultant at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a
director of the Oak Ridge Institute
of Nuclear Studies and is on the
staff of Clark E. Center, general
manager of Carbide and Carbon
Chemical Company. Carbide oper-
ates the laboratory chief nuclear re-
search center, and other atomic
plants at Oak Ridge for the Atomic
Energy Commission.

A native of McMinnville, Ten-
nessee, Dr. Lind received his
formal education at Washington

14

and Lee, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and the University of
Leipsic, which conferred a Ph.D.
degree on him in 1905. The Uni-
versities of Colorado, Michigian
and Washington and Lee have
awarded him honorary doctor of
science degrees. He has served as
Dean of the Chemistry Depart-
ment of the University of Minne-
sota, and as President of the Amer-
ican Chemical Society for 1940.

Dr. Payne, ‘11, Leaves
Bequest to University

Dr. Mossy H. Payne, B.A.
"11, who died in New York City on
March 29, named Washington and
Lee University in his will as the
recipient of one of three scholar-
ships for “deserving students from
the State of Virginia.” ‘The Wash-
ington and Lee scholarship, to be
known as Mosby H. Payne and
Virginia Winter Payne Scholar-
ship is for a student expecting to
major in chemistry. The will stipu-
lates this “shall be construed to
mean one or more.”

An estimated $200,000 estate

was left to Mrs. Payne during her
lifetime. Then, the three schools
named will share equally in the
income from the remainder of the
estate.

After receiving the Bachelor of
Arts degree from Washington and
Lee in 1911, Dr. Payne completed
his medical education at the Uni-
versity of Virginia and Johns
Hopkins University. He practiced
for two years in Lynchburg, Vir-
ginia; returned to New York and
was a practicing physican there
for 27 years. In July, 1949, he re-
tired to his family home, “The
Meadows,” on Bent Creek in Ap-
pomattox County, Virginia, but
returned to New York in 1951, to
live but not to practice.

Mosby G. Perrow, Jr., 730,
State Senator from Lynchburg,
Virginia, was named as executor
and trustee of the estate.

The ROTC Flag

A hand-embroidered flag depict-
ing the official crest of Washing-
ton and Lee University has been
presented to the School’s Reserve
Officer Training Corps by _ the
United States Government.

It is shown in its natural colors,
with the name of the school and
the reserve unit sewn on red rib-
bon below. The flag will accom-
pany the National Flag at all pa-
rades and similar functions and
will be escorted by an armed color
ouard whenever uncased.

paid to the University as tuition

board at the Old Blue Hotel
(always painted red), plus $2.00
