Politics as Usual

University News

PRING SNEAKED IN suddenly
S one pleasant day in April,
and the Washington and -Lee
campus .never looked _ lovelier.
Stark tree branches all of a sud-
den sprouted frothy green foliage,
the grass lawns looked like a color
advertisement for Vigoro, and stu-
dents and teachers alike hastened
to get out cord coats and white
buckskin shoes.

Spring fever hit the classrooms,
and the Saturday afternoon excur-
sions to Goshen began anew. Young
ladies clad fetchingly in bermuda
shorts and brief blouses material-
ized to decorate the terraces at fra-
ternity houses. The Ring-tum Phi
suggested plaintively that Washing-
ton and Lee’s annual spring vaca-
tion needed to be lengthened to ten
days or two weeks, instead of the
usual one week.

And with it all, came politics as
usual. Both the University and In-
dependent parties put up strong
slates of candidates for campus of-
ficers this year, and plastered the
campus with picture posters. After
the votes had been tallied on April
25, it was found the Independents
had won two, and the University
party five offices. President of the
student body for next year is John
Arnold Groobey of Norfolk, Vir-
ginia, an Independent. Vice-presi-
dent is John Gill Holland, Jr.,
Lynchburg, Virginia, University
party; secretary, Larry M. ‘Topping,
Newport News, Virginia, Univer-
sity; Opening dances, C. Royce

tucky, Independent; Spring dances,
Ralph M. Evans, Cleveland, Ohio,
University; Finals dances, Farris P.
Hotchkiss, Richmond, Virginia,
University party.

Other activities during the spring
months were many and varied. ‘The
Troubadour theater presented,
“The Man Who Came to Dinner,”

March 13-16. The Student War |

Memorial Scholarship Fund Com-
mittee Minstrel Show followed on
April 12 and 13, with the theme
of ‘“‘Odds-at-Sea,”’
Homer’s Greek classic, The Odys-

sey. The Mary Washington College |
Glee Club came to town on April

16 for a joint concert with the

Doremus gymnasium. A few days
later, the University singing group,
under the direction of Mr. Robert
Stewart, departed for its first con-
cert tour in three years. On the
itinerary were appearances at Fred-
ericksburg, Virginia; Washington,
D.C.; Baltimore, Maryland; and
Harrisonburg, Virginia.

The Schools of the University
were busy, too. ‘The fiftieth anni-
versary of the School of Commerce
and Administration, oldest  de-
partment of its kind in the South,
was observed April 15. Fred C.
Foy, president of Koppers Com-
pany, Inc., of Pittsburgh, was the
principal speaker at Lee Chapel
for the birthday celebration. ‘This
year, 250 students, or about one-
fourth of Washington and Lee’s to-
tal enrollment, are in the School of
Commerce and Administration.
Headed by Dean Lewis W. Adams,
the faculty now lists 14 members.

The Lee Memorial Journalism
Foundation was host on April 26-27

to the 28th annual convention of

the Southern Interscholastic Press

Association. Over goo student and

Happy fiftieth birthday to the School of Commerce and Administration at Washington

faculty delegates, representing more
than 160 Southern - preparatory
and high schools, attended and
heard speakers such as Marquis
Childs, syndicated columnist; Clif-
ford Dowdey, Jr., novelist and _his-
torian; and Joseph W. Musial, car-
toonist for the “Katzenjammer
Kids,’ and educational director of
King Features syndicate.

More than 65 college and high
school teachers attended a one-day
meeting of the Virginia chapters of
the American Association of ‘Teach-
ers of French and Spanish on April
13 at Washington and Lee. Princi-
pal speakers were professor Jean
Canu, of the School of Foreign
Service at Georgetown University,
and professor Hector H. Orjuela
of Virginia Military Institute.

‘The final Seminar in Literature
was held April 25 by the English
department. Randall Jarrell, con-
sultant in poetry to the Library of
Congress and author and critic,
spoke on “The Poet and ‘The
Public.” >

Other events were newsworthy.
Librarian Henry E. Coleman, Jr.,
after waiting nearly 16 years for
an elevator in McCormick Library,
finally got it in April. Workmen
had to drill for 10 nerve-wracking
days to remove a solid bed of rock
in order to complete the elevator
shaft, but now the new elevator is
servicing five levels of stacks in the
library storage area. In March,
grounds crewmen sprinkled the
campus liberally with thick concen-
trations of fertilizer to make the
grass grow in worn places, and stu-
dents prayed for quick rains. On
April 24, after the lawn had grown
thick again, the Interfraternity
Council held its first annual Easter
Ege Hunt on the front campus for
250 youngsters from Lexington’s
elementary school. ‘The six happy
kids who located the most eggs
were given baby rabbits as prizes,
and all contestants were given ice
cream. Some of the children, tak-
ing a cue from the President’s Egg

Roll in Washington, got down
on their hands and knees and rolled
their Easter eggs in the grass (See
page 7). A very few decided that the
best idea was to throw them at
friends, a plan quickly squelched
by panting fraternity men.

In May, all eyes were turned to-
ward the fast-approaching final ex-
aminations and graduation week.
Charles M. Drum of Richmond was
named valedictorian of the class of
1957- Drum, who will graduate with
a bachelor of science degree in
chemistry, had the highest academic
average of any senior, and will de-
liver the traditional valedictory ad-
dress to his class on June 7. He is
the son of Dr. and Mrs. E. A. Drum

 

PROFESSOR JOHNSON

of Richmond, and is a member of

# A NEW TEXTBOOK by Dr. Lewis
Kerr Johnson, head of the depart-
ment of commerce at Washington
and Lee, was published in April.
Entitled “Sales and Marketing Man-

agement,” the book was published
by the college division of Allyn and
Bacon of Boston, and is intended
for use in marketing management
classes on the advanced under-
graduate level.

Dr. Johnson served as an official
representative of the United States
Navy on the Chicago War Man-
power Commission and was Civil-
ian Personnel Officer for that
branch of the service.

As a member of the Advisory
Council on the Virginia Economy
of Richmond, he wrote the report
of the committee on markets and
marketing entitled, “Marketing in
Virginia.”

The author received a John M.
Glenn grant-in-aid from Washing-
ton and Lee to assist him in com-
pletion of the book.

His textbook, which will sell for
$6.95, develops the philosophy that
marketing is a function of manage-
ment, and can only be approached
wisely as a coordinated activity,
not as separately managed units of
advertising, selling, merchandising,
or transportation. Each chapter in-
cludes cases and questions, charts
and tables. It contains 644 pages.

m DR. J. N. BEHRMAN, associate pro-
fessor of economics and_ political
science at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, is co-author of a textbook
on international economics pub-
lished March g0 by Rinehart and
Company.

Written in collaboration with Dr.
W. E. Schmidt, of the George
Washington University department
of economics, the volume deals with
the theory, practice and policy of
world economics. Its 550 pages
appeal mainly to the junior-senior
college level.

Included is an appraisal of the
various foreign aid programs con-
ducted by the United States since
World War II, and an attempt is
made to analyse the extent to which
America may rely on this tactic to
obtain foreign policy objectives.

RESEARCH AND STUDY grants for
fourteen Washington and Lee Uni-
versity professors amount to $6,175,
in an aid program designed to pro-

vide assistance to teachers in

scholarly pursuit.

The grants are the fourth such
annual awards under the John M.
Glenn program, established in 1953
through a $120,000 gift from the
late philanthropist. Glenn was an
ofhcial of the Russell Sage Founda-
tion and a member of the Class of
1879 at Washington and Lee.

Last year, 22 professors in eleven
teaching fields shared $6,400 in
awards. ‘This year’s 14 recipients
represent nine teaching fields, and
individual awards range from $215
to $900, depending upon the type
of research or study involved. Pro-

Help in the,annual March of Dimes cam-
paign in Lexington was given by IFC
members during “Hell Week.” These two
students roamed Main street, giving shoe
shines. Others buttonholed passersby or
stopped motorists for dimes for the polio
drive, and in all, collected more than $455

THE INTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL,
for many years a high-sounding but
little-doing campus organization,
has blossomed forth this year as
one of the most active, beneficial,
and powerful groups here.

Among its accomplishments have
been the contribution of more than
$1,000 to Lexington and Rock-
bridge County Charities and the
supervision of what university of-
ficials believe was the safest and
sanest fraternity initiation week in
the school’s history.

Dean of Students Frank J. Gil-
liam was enthusiastic about the
forward steps taken by the IFC un-
der the leadership of senior Donald
S. Luria of Philadelphia.

“I think the university family
and the community in general have
benefited from a number of con-
structive social projects carried out
under the auspices of the Inter-
fraternity Council,” says Dean Gil-
liam. “I have viewed this develop-
ment with enthusiasm, and I cer-
tainly hope that it will continue.”

Under Washington and _ Lee’s
student government set-up, the IFC

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

is charged with complete jurisdic-
tion over rushing, hazing, pledg-
ing, and disciplinary action in-
volving fraternities. It also super-
vises academic ratings of chapters,
insuring that certain university
scholastic requirements for mem-

bership are maintained.

Dean Gilliam pointed out that
the past year has been marked by
outstanding progress in eliminating
undesirable and hazardous elements
from fraternity hazing procedures.
He cited the IFC role in this, and
commended the group for its work
concerning general fraternity con-
duct.

Referring to the recent fraternity
“Hell Week,’ Dean Gilliam said,
“The general verdict is that, while
there were some regrettable lapses
and return to outmoded practices,
the overall picture of initiations
demonstrated a hopeful degree of
mature conduct, and a definite
move toward a greater exercise of
student government in their own
affairs.”

A part of the IFC-sponsored
phase of fraternity initiations saw
freshman pledges collect over $455
for the Rockbridge County March
of Dimes. And they engaged in
other improvements
projects during the five-day period.

community

Besides the polio fund assistance
the IFC also made other notable
contributions to community funds.
At Christmas, $340 went to the
community Christmas basket fund,
marking the third year of steady
growth of this activity. In 1954, the
gift was $120, and in 1955 the sum
was $310.

In the recently completed cam-
paign for funds for the Stonewall
Jackson Memorial Hospital wing,
the IFC chipped in with $370.

The money for the baskets and
the hospital was derived from an-
nual assessments made by the IFC

In other projects, the IFC is con-
tributing $180 yearly toward the

SPRING 1957

support of a 12-year-old Greek war
orphan on the island of Crete. And
two foreign exchange students and
another university student are re-
ceiving $550 in scholarship assist-
ance from the IFC this year. Funds
for these activities come from rush-
ing fees paid by freshmen, and from
fines levied on fraternities for dis-
ciplinary reasons.

Next year, President Luria says
the council hopes to finance the
attendance at Washington and Lee
of a Hungarian refugee student. He
says the search is now underway to
find a qualified Hungarian young
man for the IFC assistance.

@ HERBERT J. HUMMERS, Washing-

Two hundred and fifty exuberent youngsters from the elementary school in Lexington
were guests of the Interfraternity Council at an Easter Egg Hunt, April 24, on the front
campus. Arriving after all day in school, the children quickly covered the campus and
rooted out the dozens of colored eggs deposited in the grass. Then a large number of
snicking snippets gathered in front of Lee Chapel to roll their Easter eggs up to the
columns. Our photographer was on hand to catch this picture of the festivities.

m WASHINGTON AND LEE’S Military
Department underwent its annual

8

formal Second Army _ inspection
April 24. A five-man _ inspection
team, all members of ROTC staffs
at other colleges, spent the day
meeting with school officials, attend-
ing classes, inspecting facilities, and
examining supply and administra-
tion procedures. Climax of the in-
spection was a review of the cadet
regiment, commanded by Theodore
M. Kerr, of Midland, Texas.

The inspection team was com-
posed of Col. Kenneth A. Cunin,
Ohio State University; Lt. Col.
George W. Eason, Dickinson Col-
lege; Maj. Cecil M. Curles, and
Capt. Lawrence E. Butler, Univer-

m WASHINGTON AND LEE university,
a school not universally noted for
its military curriculum, neverthe-
less staged its first annual Military
Ball on March 15. The ROTC unit
and the local chapter of Scabbard
and Blade planned the event, which
featured the music of Woody Her-
man and his orchestra.

The evolution of Army dress
from the American Revolution to
the present time was the decorative
theme. Murals of soldiers in vari-
ous uniforms of American wars
hung from the walls in Doremus
gymnasium.

Members of the 450-man ROTC

m THE ROCKBRIDGE HISTORICAL So-
ciety has presented Washington and
Lee with a bronze plaque which
will designate a campus residence
as the former home of three of the
county’s foremost historical figures.

The 8 by 12-inch plaque is in-
scribed: “Here lived Margaret

Junkin Preston, 1848-1857, ‘Poetess
of the Confederacy’; Thomas J.
(Stonewall) Jackson, 1853-1857;
Robert E. Lee, 1865-1869. Placed by
the Rockbridge Historical Society,
1957.

Known locally as “Lee-Jackson
House,” the home is located on
Washington and Lee’s front cam-
pus. It is now occupied by Profes-
sor and Mrs. Charles R. McDowell,
and it is not open to the public.

m WASHINGTON AND LEE is going in-
to the pulpwood and timber busi-
ness.

It may be some 20 to 25 years
before a return on the investment
is realized, but to the 208-year-old
institution this isn’t so long, and
the start has been made.

University workers, with the as-
sistance of Virginia Division of
Forestry experts and the U. S. De-
partment of Agriculture soil con-
servation men, planted some 40,000
white pine seedlings on university
property near the ruins of Liberty
Hall Academy. Purchased at a price
of $6.50 per thousand from the state
nursery at Charlottesville, the two-
year-old seedlings cover approxi-
mately 33 acres of land, with rough-
ly 1,200 trees to the acre.

A tree-planting device which can
put up to 10,000 trees in the ground
daily with expert operation was
borrowed from the Division of For-
estry for the job.

Philip Nicely, a state forester
from the division’s district seven in
Staunton, says the university order
is the largest single order for seed-
lings from the state nursery this
year, and might well be an all-time
high. District seven embraces 11
counties in the Shenandoah Valley
area, and only 305,000 seedlings
have been planted over the entire
district this year, Mr. Nicely said.

Both Nicely and J. W. Hodge,
district management chief, were on
hand when planting operations be-
gan in March. ‘They instructed uni-
versity grounds workmen in the use

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

of the planter and care of the seed-
lings.

‘The project is being conducted
on university property known as
Liberty Hall farm, located just
northwest of the campus on high
ground overlooking both Washing-
ton and Lee and Virginia Military
Institute. The land was once
farmed extensively, but has become
severely eroded. Soil conservation
experts recommended reforestation.

In 20 to 25 years, according to
Mr. Hodge, the trees will be ready
for thinning, the income from
which should just about pay for the
initial outlay for seedlings and
planting. Later on, regular harvest-
ing for timber and pulpwood can
be made.

 

m THE WASHINGTON AND LEE faculty
passed the following resolution,
after the death of Col. Milton B.

Rogers, ‘17, in a bus accident on
January 4, 1957, Just north of Lex-
ington:

“The Faculty of Washington and
Lee University has learned with
deep sorrow of the tragic and un-
timely death of a former colleague,
Milton Barbee Rogers, on January
fourth, 1957.

“A veteran of both World Wars,
serving his country in all grades
from second heutenant to colonel,
Milton Rogers participated widely
in combat and was decorated by sev-
eral foreign governments. As a busi-
ness man he filled successfully many
positions of trust and responsibility.
As an alumnus of Washington and
Lee, of the Class of 1917, he ren-
dered conspicuous service to his
alma mater when he returned in
August, 1946, at great sacrifice to
himself and his own business affairs,
to serve as Executive Director of the
University’s Bicentennial Fund
campaign. His fine executive abil-
ity, tact, and wisdom were displayed

SPRING 1957

in the organization and energetic
direction of this effort and were
determining factors in its success.
At the same time, his magnetic per-
sonality, his consideration — for
others, his inherent kindness, and
his rare sense of humor endeared
him permanently to the faculty
members who served with him on
committees and to the many alumni
who collaborated.

“Colonel Rogers was a man of
strong loyalties—to his native state
of Kentucky, to his country, to his
business associates, to his alma
mater, and above all, to his friends.
His was an exceptional talent for
friendship and more than all else, it
is as a genial and generous friend
that we shall continue to cherish his
memory.”

A copy of the resolution was
sent to Mrs. Rogers with deepest
sympathy.

 

THREE VERY SUCCESSFUL and time-

ly lectures on the topic, “A Look
at Policy-Making Powers of the
United States Supreme Court” fea-
tured the ninth annual John Ran-
dolph ‘Tucker Lectures at Wash-
ington and Lee’s Law School April
19-20.

‘The speaker was Frederick D. G.
Ribble, dean for 18 years of the
Law school at the University of
Virginia, and a widely known au-
thority on constitutional law and
taxation.

Congressional action to remedy
segregation complaints, he said,
might have been slow in coming if
the United States Supreme Court
had ruled that Congress, rather
than local school authorities, should
handle the difficult problem. ‘The
high court displayed an important
exercise of policy-making powers
in deciding that states should work
out their segregation problems
subject to the federal courts, and

 

The oldest and the youngest lawyers pres-
ent at the Tucker Lectures got together
afterward for a chat. They are GEORGE
Haw, ‘04, of Richmond, Virginia, and
CHARLES GROVE, president of the 1957 law
class, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Mr.
Haw’s father was graduated with a law
degree from Washington and Lee in 1867,
and his son in 19048.

not federal statutes, he continued.

“Given the choice, the people
affected might well prefer this
method to congresisonal action and
supervision—on that we can but
guess,” Dean Ribble declared. “In
all frankness, it would be said that
congressional action would prob-
ably have not come so soon.”

Speaking before an audience of
several hundred law students, pro-
fessors, and attorneys, he reminded
that “the general provisions of the
constitution, such as due process of
law and equal protection of the
laws, express in the abstract ideals
which all men of good will accept.
Simply stated, they are fair play and
equality before the law. We have
seen that these concepts have had
varying interpretations in varying
situations, and they will continue
to have varying interpretations as
long as men’s minds differ.”

The court is the weakest of the
three branches of government in
actual allocation to powers in the
Constitution, he said. Its strength
is in the respect of the people of

the country. [Turn page]

Following the last ‘Tucker lecture,

spring as vice-president for the
Fourth Circuit of the American
Law Students’ Association, the law
school counterpart of the Amerti-

Maryland, West Virginia, and
North and South Carolina.

B WASHINGTON AND LEE’S winning-
est basketball team in history (20
victories, seven losses) came up with
its last full measure of devotion

and energy in the finals of the
Southern Conference ‘Tournament,
but it wasn’t enough to prevent

West Virginia’s powerful Moun-
taineers from taking their third
straight championship. With Coach
Billy McCann’s five starters playing
virtually the entire season without
benefit of substitutions, the Gen-
erals simply wore themselves out
before succumbing to All-Amert!-
can “Hot Rod” Hundley and Co.,
67-52. Washington and Lee led by
two points at the half, but the Gen-
erals just couldn’t keep up the pace.

The season brought no team
championships, but several Gener-
als reaped armfuls of individual
honors. Co-Captain and senior cen-
ter Lee Marshall and junior guard
Dom Flora were unanimous All-
Virginia Big Six choices; both were
named to the Associated Press and
Southern Conference Sportwriters’
all-conference first teams, and both
were first-team selections on the
conference All-Tournament squad.
Frank Hoss, the big forward who
will co-captain the Generals with
Flora next year, was a second-team
all-Tournament pick.

In spring sports, the big news has
been Gene Corrigan’s surprising
lacrosse team. The General stick-
men have won seven while drop-
ping three, one of the losses to the
team favored to win the national
championship (Johns Hopkins) and
another to the equally-powertul de-
fending champs (Maryland). Vic-
tories have come over Williams,
Dartmouth, Loyola, Washington,
Duke, Delaware, and Colgate. ‘The
third loss was to Hofstra, a game
the Generals shouldn’t have given
up, since they’ve beaten teams
which handled Hofstra with ease.

Goalie Jim Lewis and attack Dick
Moore are strong contenders for
All-American honors. ‘Two games,
with Baltimore and Virginia, re-
main as this 1s written.

In track, wins over Elon and Ran-
dolph-Macon have been offset by
losses to Lynchburg, Richmond,
Davidson, and Hampden-Sydney.
Captain Alex Platt has been a con-
sistent winner in the shot and dis-

cus, and there may be a future
record breaker in Skip Rohnke, a
freshman javelin man. No records
have gone by the boards, although
Platt broke his own school discus
mark at the Southern Conference
meet, but he finished no better than
third.

Dom Flora’s booming and late-
blooming bat has helped the base-
ball team win four out of its last
five games and pull up to a .619
mark with five games left. Flora had
only one single in 2g times at bat
while hitting right-handed in the
early games, but he switched to the
left side of the plate and in 17 tries
he banged out a single, three
doubles, two triples, and two home
runs. Joe Knakal has a very credit-
able 4-4 mound record, despite
little support from his mates at the
plate.

Cy ‘Twombly’s golfers have drop-
ped only one dual match, a 5-4 de-
cision to VPI, but they were able
to finish only third in the South-
ern Conference ‘Tournament. Soph-
omore Ned Baber and Senior Ted
Kerr have been the mainstays.

The tennis team, which boasted
a good 8-4 record last year, hasn’t
come up with suitable replacements
for two missing lettermen, and as a
result, ‘The Generals have won only
three matches, while dropping five.
George Stuart has been Coach Bill
Chipley’s number one man all sea-
son.

m THE FOOTBALL PICTURE, a some-
what murky scene of late, took on
some new hues this spring as head
coach W. A. Chipley, ’49, was re-
placed by Lee M. McLaughlin.
Wielding the brushes and the pal-
ette were the board of trustees, who
continued painting solidly on the
“no subsidization” theme.

The new mentor is now head
coach and athletic director at Epis-
copal High School, Alexandria, Vir-
ginia. Forty years old, he was for-
merly captain of the University

SPRING 1957

of Virginia football team, and. be-
fore entering the Navy in 1942,
played professional football for the
Green Bay Packers. His Episcopal
eleven has not lost a game in the
non-military prep school league of
Virginia since 1950, and has been
one of the most powerful teams in
the greater Washington area. His
success in fielding winning teams
has been due in large measure to
his use of a variation of the ‘Tl’ form-
ation which he calls the “Go-T.”
President Gaines, in announcing
McLaughlin’s contract in April,
said, ““‘We consider ourselves for-
tunate in securing the services of
Mr. McLaughlin. Though not an
alumnus, his family has had ties
with the institution for many years.
He is known and admired by many
members of the University family.”
The new coach is a native of
Rockbridge county, where his fath-
er was a Presbyterian minister.
His wife, the former Rosa Hodges
of Richmond, is the daughter of a
prominent Washington and Lee
alumnus, the late Col. LeRoy
Hodges, ’10. Her brother LeRoy,

Jv. was a member of the class of
1935. Lhe McLaughlins have three
daughters and one son, and plan to
come to Lexington early in the
summer.

Mr. McLaughlin has a boy’s sum-
mer camp, ‘““Maxwelton,” near
Brownsburg in Rockbridge County.
He has operated it for some years.

In a meeting with the ’57 squad
on April 21, coach McLaughlin
proposed a doctrine of positive
thinking for success under an ama-
teur football program. “We're go-
ing to think in terms of winning
them all next year,” he said. ‘““We’re
not going to think in terms of los-
ing a single ball game, and that
means winning the opener with
Centre College.”’ He expressed him-
self in agreement with the non-
subsidized football program at
Washington and Lee, and declared,
“I don’t think there’s anything
greater than playing football for
fun. That’s what we’ve been doing
at Episcopal High and I like it.”

Chipley’s release as head coach
on February 26 came as something
of a surprise. The board of trustees

General stalwart, straight for the goal. The player scoring is Dick Moore, attackman.

11

made the decision at its January
meeting in Washington, D.C., but
notification came a month later.
Chipley’s contract was extended
from February first until September
first, 1957, and he was asked to re-
main on the faculty as a member
of the department of physical edu-
cation. ‘This he declined to do, say-
ing he would leave at the end of the
semester. Chipley’s teams had one
victory in 15 games over a_ two-
year period of ‘simon-pure’ ball.

President Gaines declared his
‘very personal regret” that Bill did
not choose to continue at the Un1-
versity, and paid tribute to him as
“a man of excellent character, of
great fidelity to his duties, and a
fine influence over the college boys
on the campus.”

“Varied sources of information
which came to the board,” explain-
ed Dr. Gaines, “‘indicated that Mr.
Chipley had every requirement of
character and personality, but that
he was unable to teach the boys the
kind of football which he himself
played with = great distinction.
‘There was no other reason which
compelled the board in its deci-
sion.”

Chipley, in press reports, said the
news of his dismissal came as a sur-
prise to him from the board. “I
think,”” he added, “they’ve made
two hasty decisions—the one in ’54
(the beginning of the non-subsi-
dized program) and the one now.
I can not conceive how mature
people on the board of trustees can
expect winning results under a non-
subsidized program in two years.”

He said he thought his team had
been showing steady improvement.
“We were getting a better in-class
schedule and we were getting so
that our young boys could be talked
to in terms of football. Last year’s
team was 75 per cent better than the
year before. We weren't getting
pushed around. We thought we
could look forward to two or three
wins next season.”

President Gaines emphasized the

12

trustees’ desire to provide each of
Washington and Lee’s twelve inter-
collegiate sports with the best coach-
ing possible. He said the board re-
mains convinced that a program of
amateur athletics is best for the in-
stitution. In football, one of the
dozen sports at Washington and
Lee, the board looks for good foot-
ball, but not necessarily for vic-
tories, Dr. Gaines declared. It ex-
pects ‘‘a football program in which
the students give their best in truly
competetive spirit, and which the
students will enjoy.”

s A PERMANENT ANNUAL award in
memory of William Dudley Scott,
51, has been established by Fayette
County Memorial Auditorium, Fay-
etteville, West Virginia. Biull, an
outstanding member of Washington
and Lee football teams in 1949 and
1950, died in October, 1956, of
cancer.

The award, a large trophy, was
presented for the first time on
March 9g, 1957, following the Fay-
ette County Class “A” basketball
tournament, and was presented to
the individual judged outstanding
in character, leadership, and sports-
manship. Duplicates of the original
trophy will be awarded each year.

When presenting the award, E.
W. Dunkley, principal of Mount
Hope High School, which Bill at-
tended, made the following re-
marks, “It is now my pleasure to
present the William Dudley Scott
Memorial ‘Trophy for 1957. One
of the finest young men to repre-
sent Fayette County, Bill Scott star-
red in athletics and was outstand-
ing in student activities at Mount
Hope High School and at Wash-
ington and Lee University. He died
in October, 1956, a victim of cancer.

“Bill Scott was a shining example
of the highest qualities of charac-
ter, leadership and sportsmanship.
It is our sincere wish that the Wil-
liam Dudley Scott Memorial Tro-
phy will be the most eagerly sought
award at this tournament each

year. It is awarded on the basis
of those same fine qualities which
Scott so typified during his life-
time. It gives me great pleasure in-
deed to present this first such
award...”

Dining Hall and Dorms
Due in Fifteen Months

‘THE PROPOSED new student din-
ing hall and upperclassmen’s dorm1-

should be a reality by fall of next
year, if ail goes well. A tentative tar-
get date of September, 1958, has
been set for completion of the new
facilities, President Gaines says.

Final approval of the architects’
plans will probably be granted at
the June meeting of the universi-

of some phases by the planners. ‘The
board has been ironing out details
this spring with the architects, and
the working drawings are now be-

‘There will be three new build-
ings, all fronting on Washington
street near the President’s home.

‘The dining hall will be the first
full scale facility of its kind at
Washington and Lee. Plans call for
a main dining room which will
seat a minimum of 423 students.
and a maximum of 550. The build-
ing will also contain two auxiliary
dining rooms which may be con-
verted into lounges, or banquet
rooms; the University store; and
the book store. It will be connected
to the present Student Union
building which will be remodeled.

‘The two upperclassmen’s dormi-
tories will be erected nearby, with
a capacity of 40 boys in each build-
ing. Ihe rooms will be in singles,

ferings of show songs, spirituals,
barber shop favorites, and novelty
numbers were so well-received that
they inspired the patrons to join
in. And were the students pleased
when some guests gave them the
celebrity treatment, with requests
for autographs and snapshots!
The boys didn’t spend all their
time working for room and board
by the singing method, though.
They enjoyed long lazy days under
the sun, away from books and
quizzes, and contributing a good
deal to the enjoyment was the fact
that a number of young lady college

  
 

students were also vacationing at
the hotel. The associations were so
pleasant, according to one member
of the Sazeracs, that at least five of
the group are continuing their
friendships with the girls via Uncle
Sam’s mail service.

Ledyard D. Gardner, general
manager of the hotel, wrote Dean
Frank J. Gilliam after the Sazer-
ac’s engagement that he had an
“exceptionally high opinion of
them both as individuals and as a
group. Their conduct was exem-
plary, their cooperation complete,
and their thoughtfulness note-
worthy. The entire visit reflected
most favorably on themselves and
on Washington and Lee Universi-

FTER EIGHT YEARS of improvised

facilities, Washington and Lee’s
communications students have at
last found a home for their labora-
tory work in radio and film com-
munication.

For the first time since “Home
Edition,’ the nightly 15-minute
news broadcast of the Department
of Journalism and Communica-
tions, went on the air in 1948, bud-
ding radio and film producers were
able this year to carry out their ac-
tivities in centralized facilities that
afford them attractive, protession-
al working conditions.

The new home of the Communi-
cations Laboratory, which sponsors
“Home Edition,” a bi-weekly 30-
minute feature radio series called

“Kaleidoscope,” and a variety of
film productions, is old Payne Hall
1. The large, ground-floor  class-
room, traditionally used by the De-
partment of Englsh, was turned
over to the Department of Journal-
ism and Communications last sum-
mer, in exchange for Payne Hall 26,
which became the Moffatt Seminar.
During the late summer, construc-
tion crews converted the room into
a wing of the department’s previous
quarters on the ground floor of
Payne Hall. Completed as the col-
lege term opened in September, the
new wing houses a radio studio,
control room and laboratory, as
well as two new offices and a foyer.

‘The studio, soundproofed and
separated from the control room by

A New
Studio for
Communications

Students

a professional studio window, is
decorated with a series of four mu-
rals representing the mass media—
newspapers, radio, television and
motion pictures—which were a gift
to the department from _ Sol
Taishoff, editor and publisher of
Broadcasting-Telecasting Magazine,
Washington, D.C. The room is
furnished with chairs, couches, floor
lamps and music stands donated by
Station WDBJ, Roanoke, Virginia.

‘The control room, directly be-
hind the studio, is the center of
technical broadcasting operations.
Equipment installed there as the
facilities opened in September in-
clude a sound input console, studio

able tape recorder, transcription

turntable, monitor loudspeaker,
motion picture camera, film edit-
ing machine, film titler, projectors,
and cabinets for records, tapes, and
films.

The console, a gift from R. J.
Rockwell, vice-president and di-
rector of engineering for the Cros-
ley Broadcasting Corporation, Cin-
cinnati, Ohio, permits mixing of
sounds from various sources, in-
cluding recorders, playback ma-
chines, and up to four microphones.
It allows simultaneous output of
the radio signal to broadcast facili-
ties, recording machines, and moni-
tors.

The studio tape recorder was an
earlier gift from an alumnus, Gil-
more N. Nunn, ’31, of Lexington,
Kentucky.

Completion of the improved fa-
cilities for communications labora-
tory work was the signal for in-
creased vigor in radio and film pro-
duction during the year. In addi-
tion to “Home Edition” and ‘“‘Ka-
leidoscope,” the radio staff gave as-
sistance to the Glee Club in prepa-
ration of a biweekly music series,
which was broadcast by Station
WREL via the Washington and Lee
remote facilities. Melvin L. Link-
ous, program director of Station
WSLS, Roanoke, joined the staff as
a part-time laboratory instructor.
Students in television and motion
pictures completed several films—
among them a documentary on the
annual convention of the Southern
Interscholastic Press Association,
held in April—and plans were be-
ing made at year’s end for further
program expansion in the fall.

ty, and we hope they will return

At Washington and Lee and in
the surrounding communities, the
Sazeracs have established  them-
selves as one of the most popular
singing organizations ever. ‘They
have appeared at Hollins, Ran-
dolph-Macon, and Sweet Briar Col-
leges, the Virginia Industrial Man-
agement conferences, Central Vir-
ginia Industries’ meeting, Lees’ Rug
Sales Clinics, civic meetings, and a
host of alumni and parents’ func-
tions at the college.

Last year the group made a
special 10-inch long-play recording
which was enthusiastically received,
and another record is scheduled to
be cut soon.

The Sazeracs, who take their
name from a famous New Orleans
drink, were organized in 1955, un-
der the direction of Jim Lewis of
Irvington-on-Hudson, New York,
who also prepared their special
close-harmony arrangements. ‘Chere
were ten in the original group, two

18

of whom are still members. Lewis,

now in graduate school, still does:

some of the arrangements and mails
the music back. The first Sazeracs
were hand-picked by Lewis from
among the best of several fraternity
singing groups, but replacements
today are chosen by try-out. Cur-
rently, all the members are either
sophomores or juniors, to insure the
continuity of the group.

Members, besides Miller, are:
Ralph Baucom, Shreveport, Louis-
1ana; Tom Branch, Atlanta, Geor-
gia; ‘Tom Gowenlock, Chicago;
Bul Martin, Englewood, New Jer-
sey; Bob Moeller, Providence,
Rhode Island; Chris Rehlan, Plan-
dome, New York; Ken Sadler, New
Orleans, Louisiana; Watty Watring,
Beverly, West Virginia; ‘Tony
Weeks, Sea Cliff, New York; and
George Allen, Swarthmore, Penn-
sylvania. Branch and Sadler were
charter members. Jack Lackmann
of Lexington, Virginia, was a mem-
ber of the group this year until
he entered the Army in March. Al-
len is the pianist, and Watring fills
in with his guitar as a folksong
specialist. Gowenlock, Baucom, and
Watring are soloists.

1867 Student’s
Letter Found

A letter from a Washington and
Lee student of go years ago turned
up at the university recently. Writ-
ten by John F. Swayne of Lexing-
ton, Tennessee, on December 29,
1867, it described the college to his
aunt in ‘Texas.

“IT suppose you are aware who is
our President—if not, he’s the great-
est man living of our age, Gen. R.
FE. Lee... Expenses are very high
here indeed. A person can’t get
along here ten months with less
than four hundred dollars at all.
The people take advantage of the
students here and charge nearly
double the price for things they
know they are obliged to have. But
I can say one thing in their behalf,
that is they are a church-going
people. ‘They nearly everyone be-
long to some church. We have four
different churches here—the Episco-
pal, Baptist, Presbyterian, and
Methodist. Genl. Lee is a member
of the Episcopal. This place is
noted for big men—we have four
or five Generals and one Governor.

“I am in hopes you have had
quite a nice Christmas. For myself
I believe I never spent as dull a one
in my life. We were only allowed
one day and that was as many as I
wanted, as I knew but few people
here...I have been in this place
for nearly four months now, have
had quite a pleasant time ever since
my arrival.”

He was 17 years old at the time,
and a freshman at Washington Col-
lege. He later settled in Fort Worth,
‘Texas, and practiced law there un-
til his death.

One of his most prized posses-
sions was an excuse from classes,
signed by the famous general: “Mr.
John F. Swayne is excused from
recitations until the 22nd inst. in-
clusive on account of ill health.
Signed, R. E. Lee.”

Dean of Virginia school superin-
tendents is Dr. J. J. Kelly,’12, who
has served with distinction for 40

years as head of Wise county
schools.

He has instituted many new
school programs. Under his leader-
ship, Wise county in 1919 was the
first county to organize a summer
high school. Wise county was the
first to employ high school prin-
cipals on a 12-months’ basis in the
1920's. Wise county was the first to
organize the 12th grade, in 1936.

Other firsts were the placing of
commercial courses in the regular

curriculum, and the ownership and
operation of a countywide voca-
tional school. And with it all, Dr.
Kelly has operated the schools so
economically that the cost of ad-
ministration of Wise county schools
is less than that of any other coun-
ty in the state.

In 1917, when he became super-
intendent, the total value of all
schools was $41,400. Now property
value is $6,500,000, with several
million-dollar schools constructed
only recently. One of these new
plants is named the J. J. Kelly
High School in tribute to this be-
loved man.

Always active in civic work, he
was one of the group of citizens who
took the initiative in establishing
Clinch Valley College, a branch of
the University of Virginia. He has
been president of the Virginia Edu-
cation Association, president of
the Department of Superintendents,
president of the Superintendent’s
Conference of Virginia, and is a
life member of the National Educa-
tion Association. He is a member of
Christ Episcopal church in Big
Stone Gap.

He is married to the former
Trula Watkins, and they have two
daughters and two sons.

HE BIG BROTHER movement in

Lexington, Kentucky, is headed
by John W. Merritt, ’38, who says
that the plan has been one of the
most significant human efforts in
the prevention and correction of
juvenile delinquency there.

About three years ago, John be-
came one of a group of men inter-
ested in combating the delinquency
problem in the Lexington area, but
found there was no facility to help
a mildly delinquent or pre-delin-
quent boy. The only thing the
Juvenile Court could do was to
admonish the parents and send the
boy back to them, which in most
cases, was placing the youngster in
the same environment which caused

 

JOHN is shown at far left in this picture
of comedian Danny Kaye and other
Big Brother dignitaries.

 

his delinquency, John says. ‘Then
the Big Brother movement was sug-
gested as a possible means of han-
dling the problem.

“We received wonderful co-oper-
ation from the papers, radio and
TV stations, and had speakers in
all the civic clubs during Big Brith-
er Week, and also solicited the help
of all the churches,” he declares.
“We raised a year’s budget to hire a
permanent fulltime secretary and
set him up in an office. Part of the
budget came from some of the local
W. and L. men. Last fall we were
all pleased to be accepted into the
Community Chest.”

‘The Lexington Big Brothers, un-
der John’s direction, are now work-
ing with 44 boys in a one-man-one-
boy relationship, which brings a
mature, intelligent and well-
rounded man into personal, indi-
vidual counsel with a growing boy
who might otherwise lose his way
in life. Through the encouragement
and counsel given freely by the
man, a stabilizing and helpful in-
fluence is brought to bear on the
boy in his formative years. Al Big
Brothers are volunteers. They are
men who understand and appreci-
ate the art of friendship.

Founded in 1904 as an interracial
movement, the Big Brothers of
America have as their slogan, “No
man ever stands so straight as when
he stoops to help a boy.”

Certainly!

It was there, in the ground, in the air and water. It
always had been. There are no more “raw materials”
today than there were when Rome ruled the world.

The only thing new is knowledge... knowledge of how
to get at and rearrange raw materials. Every invention
of modern times was “available” to Rameses, Caesar,
Charlemagne.

In this sense, then, we have available today in existing
raw materials the inventions that can make our lives
longer, happier, and inconceivably easier. We need only
knowledge to bring them into reality.

Could there possibly be a better argument for the
strengthening of our sources of knowledge—our colleges
and universities? Can we possibly deny that the welfare,
progress—indeed the very fate—of our nation depends
on the quality of knowledge generated and transmitted
by these institutions of higher learning?

It is almost unbelievable that a society such as ours,
which has profited so vastly from an accelerated accumu-
lation of knowledge, should allow anything to threaten
the wellsprings of our learning.

 

Atomic power in Caesar’s day?

 

Yet this is the case

The crisis that confronts our colleges today threatens
to weaken seriously their ability to produce the kind of
graduates who can assimilate and carry forward our
rich heritage of learning.

The crisis is composed of several elements: a salary
scale that is driving away from teaching the kind of
mind most qualified to teach; overcrowded classrooms;
and a mounting pressure for enrollment that will double
by 1967.

In a very real sense our personal and national progress
depends on our colleges. They must have our aid.

Help the colleges or universities of your choice. Help
them plan for stronger faculties and expansion. The
returns will be greater than you think.

crisis means to you, write for a free book-
