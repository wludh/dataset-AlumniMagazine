The 204th Commencement

Washington and Lee University
celebrated its 204th graduation
exercises on Friday, June 5, at
11:00 a.m., on the shaded campus.

President Francis Pendleton
Gaines announced the names of
recipients of scholarships, awards
and commissions. Seven members
of the graduating class received
commissions from the United States
Army, making the first time the
university's ROTC department has
awarded second lieutenant’s bars to
members of the ‘Transportation
Corps unit, established here in
1951.

Dr. Gaines delivered the tra-
ditional commencement address to
194 graduates, and Benz Buell
Howard, Jr., of Plainfield, New
Jersey, was Valedictorian of the
class. In his remarks to the gradu-
ating class, Dr. Gaines disclaimed
any “essay on the philosophy of
education” or “a capsule solution to
the problems of the universe,” and
said he sought simply “the word of
the day” for the graduates. The
most vital “word of the day,” he
said, is faith. He reminded the
graduates of General Lee’s great-
est spiritual bequest, the faith

 

 

The Academic procession with Prof. Charles Light, Marshal of the University,
leading

which made him choose as his fav-
orite hymn, “How firm a founda-

Trustees of the Association held in
the Alumni Offices on Thursday,
June 4. Mr. Webster is President
of the Webster Motor Sales Co.,
Inc. He succeeds Paul C. Buford,

Other Alumni officers elected

“were: Wyatt C. Hedrick, °10, of

Fort Worth, Texas, vice-president,
and Emmett W. Poindexter, ’20,
of New York City, treasurer.

 

Minutes of the Alumni

Association Meeting

The General Meeting of the
Washington and Lee Alumni As-
sociation was held June 4, 1953,
at 2 p.m. in Washington Chapel.

I. The meeting was called to
order by President Paul C. Buford,
13, who greeted those present on
behalf of the Alumni Board of
Trustees.

Il. Dr. Gaines spoke briefly to
the group. Elaborating on the story
of a campus visitor who had once
asked him the question, “Who is
Washington and Lee?”, Dr. Gaines
emphasized that in answering he
said that it is a fellowship of those
who toil and of those who benefit

from some measure of that toil.
“But more than a fellowship, more
than a fraternity, more than a
friendship—it is a kind of ideal to
which we all subscribe, which runs
from one generation to another.
Perhaps the ideal is that ideal of
trying to discover the fine and
gifted among the young and trying
to give them some fulfillment of
that promise. It is a kind of conse-
cration. It is a kind of altar upon
which we pour all that is fine with-
in us.” Dr. Gaines went on to say,
“I cannot imagine this University
without the interest and the sup-
port of its alumni. In fact, you
alumni are the heart of Washing-
ton and Lee. It could not exist with-
out you. I thank you for all the
help that you have given and I beg
you to remember us in such ways
and at such times that will make
us a better institution.”

Iii. H. K. Young, 717, Alumni
Secretary, made a report on the ac-
tivities of the association for the
year 1952-1953.

IV. Arch A. Sproul, ’37, ‘Treas-
urer of the Association, made a re-
port for the year ending June
30, 1952. This report showed
that our Association had trans-

 

Right—Dr. Gaines congratulates Jimmy Caskie, ’06, the Rector of the Univer-

ferred to the University Treasurer

V. President Buford introduced
Dean Lewis W. Adams of the
Commerce School and Dean Clay-
ton E. Williams, 712, of the Law
School. At the 1952 General
Alumni Meeting reports from the
Dean’s Office and the Director of
Admissions’ Office were well re-
ceived and the Alumni Board sug-
vested that other department heads
be called upon at future meetings.

Dean Adams paid tribute to the
superior work that was done by
Dean Robert H. Tucker and Dr.
Glover Hancock, now retired, and
also praised the high caliber of the
present faculty. He spoke of the
growth of the Commerce School
and reported a present enrollment
of 182 sophomores, juniors and
seniors. An outstanding record has
been made by these business stu-
dents; in the past four years two of
the valedictorians and two of the
student body presidents have come
from the School of Commerce. ‘This
School has been a member of the
American Association of Colle-
giate Schools of Business since
1927—the Association has a mem-
bership of 63 outstanding business
schools in the country.

JAMES R. CASKIE, A.B., ’06, LL.B.
09, of Lynchburg, Virginia, law firm of
Caskie, Frost, Davidson and Watts, was
elected Rector of the University Board
of Trustees, at its meeting on Thursday,
June 4, 1953.

Mr. Caskie replaces Herbert Fitz-
patrick, B.A. 92, LL.B. 793, LL.D. ’28,
of Huntington, West Virginia, who will
remain as a member of the board.

Mr. Caskie has been a member of the
board since 1924. Dr. Gaines com-
mented after the meeting that he con-
siders Mr. Caskie “one of the most
useful trustees this university has ever
had.”

 

Dean Clayton Williams reported
on the progress of the School of
Law. He said the Law School has
weathered many storms, worst of
which was during World War II
when enrollment dropped to two
students. However, the GI’s came
back rapidly, an accelerated pro-
gram was established whereby a
student, taking three semesters in
one year, could complete three
years of law in two years; and a
peak enrollment of 254 students
was reached in 1949. In 1951 the
Law School was awarded a Chapter
of the Order of the Coif. The Law
faculty now consists of six full-
time professors, one law librarian,
and two visiting lecturers. Recent
developments of note are: (1) a
Student Bar Association, sponsored

by the American Bar Association,
and work on a Moot Court Room
on the third floor of Tucker Hall;
and (2) the formation of a Law
School alumni group.

VI. Coach Carl Wise gave a
brief report on the football situa-
tion and the prospects for the com-
ing fall. He outlined many prob-
lems facing our team and especially
the difficult schedule to be met. The
schedule is as follows:

Sept. 19—Shepherd College—Lexington
Sept. 26—Maryland—College Park
Oct. <3-—North: Carolina—Chapel Hall
Oct. 10—West Virginia—Morgantown
Oct. 17—Richmond—Lexington
Oct. 24—V.P.I.—Blacksburg
Oct. 31—Geo. Washington—Lexington
Nov. 7—Davidson—Winston-Salem
Nov. 14——Virginia—Lexington (Home-
coming)
Nov. 21—William and Mary—Wil-
liamsburg

VII. The Director of Athletics,
“Cap’n Dick” Smith, was called to
give some information on the re-
cent secession of seven members
of the Southern Conference and
how it affected Washington and
Lee. It was his opinion the split was
strictly a question of the secession-
ists wanting to play big-time foot-
ball. “Cap’n Dick,” who will re-

6

tire next January after 32 years
connection with the University,
took this opportunity to voice his
thanks to the alumni for their co-
operation and support. (NOTE:
Since the meeting, Mr. Smith has
been persuaded to serve in his
present capacity at Washington
and Lee for another year, retiring
July 1, 1954.)

VIII. President Buford read the
report of the Nominating Commit-
tee for Board replacements for
Messrs. Buford and Sproul whose
terms expire on this date. Mem-
bers of the Nominating Committee,
none of whom were able to attend
this meeting, were J. L. Crist, 13,
Chairman, Howard D. Leake, ’24,
and George S. Wilson, ’25. Their
recommendations were as follows:

John F. Hendon, °24—Aca-
demic, Birmingham, Alabama;

Harry Lysle Shuey, ’24—Law,
Morganton, North Carolina.

A unanimous vote was cast for
these two alumni.

Recommendations for Alumni
membership on the University Ath-
letic Committee were Randolph
Rouse, 739, Washington, D. C. and
Warren E. Tilson, ’26, Lexington,

Virginia. A unanimous vote was
cast also for these two alumni.

IX. On motion, the meeting ad-
journed at approximately 3:20.

 

Report of the

Alumni Secretary

On June 25, 1840, a group of
former students met to organize
the Alumni Association of Wash-
ington College. It is stated in the
by-laws of that early charter that
the purposes of the Association
were: “To keep fresh the pleas-
ant memories of college life, to
preserve and strengthen the ties of
friendship then formed, and to ex-
ercise a filial care over the inter-
est and welfare of Alma Mater to
whom we acknowledge a debt of
gratitude never to be forgotten.”

Now, 113 years after the organi-
zation of your Alumni Association,
it is with pride and pleasure I make
a report which indicates Wash-
ington and Lee alumni are still ex-
ercising filial care over the interest
and welfare of Alma Mater.

* * *
Certainly much was done dur-

ing the past year to preserve and
to strengthen Washington and Lee

friendships all over the nation.
Chapter meetings have been held,
since my report of last June, by
22 local Alumni associations in
14 different States: Johnson City,
Tennessee; Baltimore, Maryland;
Birmingham, Alabama; Charles-
ton, West Virginia; Chicago, II-
linois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Charlotte,
North Carolina; Cleveland Ohio;
Danville, Virginia; Louisville, Ken-
tucky; Lynchburg, Virginia; Mem-
phis, Tennessee; New York City;
New Orleans, Louisiana; Shreve-
port, Louisiana, Newport News,
Virginia; Pittsburgh, Pennsyl-
vania; Richmond, Virginia; Roa-
noke, Virginia; St. Louis, Missouri;
Cumberland, Maryland; and Wash-
ington, D.C.

I personally attended twelve of
these Chapter meetings, and one
or more representatives of the Uni-
versity were present at the others.
Dr. Gaines was able to attend sey-
eral of these meetings, and he is
now planning an itinerary for the
coming fall that will include many
of our Southern and Southwestern
cities. No new chapters were
formed during the year but I can
report that most of our alumni
groups are more active than ever
before and certainly they are a
tremendous help and inspiration to

 

the Alumni Association and to the
University.
+ + +

Your Alumni Association has
had another good year in. all
phases of its activity. Our Student-
Alumni Relations program is _ be-
coming more firmly established.
We begin “talking Alumni Asso-
ciation” at Freshman Camp even
before the prospective alumnus has
registered as a student; the pro-
gram includes a dinner party for
the seniors shortly before gradu-
ation (at which the Association is
host); and, to put it plainly, we
never let a student forget that we
plan to lean heavily upon him when
he enters the alumni category.

We have many opportunities to
assist in student endeavor on the
campus. A recent example made
possible the recording of our own
Washington and Lee songs. Our
superior ROTC band, together with
our excellent Glee Club, needed a
sponsor to finance this project. We
were happy to come to their rescue
when they needed us, and realize
full well that our alumni organiza-
tion will need the support of all
these men. Incidentally, the record
is on sale here today. I recommend
it highly.

 

Capt. Greenlee D. Letcher, ’88, repre-
sented the oldest class here for Finals
and Hunter Lane, ’53, the youngest.

And while I am speaking of stu-
dents, it will be of interest to re-
cord that 89 sons of alumni were
in the 1952-53 student body. To-
morrow morning 16 of them will
receive their diplomas as a part of
our 204th graduating class.

As is our custom, The Alumni
Magazine was published quarterly.
The June, August and December
issues went out to subscribers only
(that 1s, to Alumni Fund contribu-
tors), plus faculty members, fra-
ternities, and exchanges. The
March number, containing the
Fund report, was mailed to the en-
tire alumni list of 10,826. Also, I
might add here that every student
is put on the Magazine list, gratis,
for one year when he graduates.
The Alumni Magazine is compiled
and edited right here in the Alumni
Office and it is printed in the Uni-
versity Journalism Press Labora-
tory. A few articles are written by
student journalists but the bulk
of the material is assembled and
written by the office staff, and
most of the class notes are digests
of letters written to the class agents.

the Alumni Office, there is just one
item I shall call to your attention
now. Certainly no Alumni Office
can function effectively without
correct addresses for all of its
alumni. I am sorry to have to re-
port to you that at the present time
there are approximately 800 for-
mer students now unlocated on our
files. We plan to concentrate on
this important phase of the work
during the summer months. Many
of you will receive tracer-cards
asking for help in locating a for-
mer classmate or friend and we
will appreciate anything you can
do to help us.

In a report of this type, I shall
aim to omit many of the numer-
ous details in which any alumni
office is necessarily engaged—such
as lists for meetings, lists for wed-
ding invitations, requests for foot-
ball tickets on the 50-yard line,
room reservations, and so forth.
We are delighted to be of service
whenever we can. In reply to the
numerous questions with regard to

8

   

Alumni Reunions at Finals, I will
take this opportunity to report that
we plan to begin shortly on the pro-
eram of our 1954 Reunion for all
classes on the order of the Bicen-
tennial-Alumni Reunion of 1949.
Beginning in the early fall pre-
liminary plans will start reaching
you. This will be the Bicentennial
plus 5 years—and we hope to make
it the grandest reunion ever.

* * *

Now I have come to that portion
of my report which pleases me
most. I refer to the Alumni Fund.
Our annual Alumni Fund is one
of the most significant elements in
Washington and Lee’s financial
operations. Each year the proceeds
of this Annual Giving program are
turned over to the Trustees of the
University as unrestricted funds to
be used wherever they will do the
most good for the University. The
year 1952 was the most successful
for our Fund since it was started
in 1933. Even in these days the
total we received, $44,520.19, is
a sizeable sum of money; and the
2,105 contributors who gave so
generously total just exactly 119
more contributors than we have
ever had before. But with 10,826
located alumni on our list, 20 per
cent response is not enough. So
much for the 1952 Fund.

We must raise our sights if we
are to continue to be of financial
assistance to the University. Our
goal this year was set at $50,000.
As of this 4th day of June, I report
$30,013.39 of this amount has
already been raised. And may I
add this is the largest amount of
money I have ever been able to re-
port at an Alumni Day General
Meeting. I further report that the
number of 1,344 contributors is
the largest ever for this date.

Our 87 class agents are turning
in another great performance. I
want to take this opportunity to ex-
press to them my real gratitude
for their cheerful and wholehearted
cooperation.

The Alumni Fund is filling a

crucial need in the University fi-
nancial picture. It must continue to
do so if we want to preserve for
our sons, and their sons, all that
is good in Washington and Lee.

* * +

In closing I want to take this
opportunity to thank our Alumni
Board of Trustees for a job well
done. They have directed the poll-
cies of our Association with
thoughtfulness and understanding.
President Paul C. Buford has been
in constant touch with the Alumni
Office and with the entire adminis-
trative staff of the University. He
has furthered our cause immeasur-
ably.

Respectfully submitted,
Harry K. YounG

Dick McLaughlin Exudes Good Humor

The following story on RICHARD
JAMES (Dick) McLAuGHLIN,
B.S. ’35, written by a co-worker,
appeared in a recent issue of the
Cleveland Press, Cleveland, Ohio.

The most amazing thing about
Richard James McLaughlin—as
viewed from an adjoining desk—is
the balding little fellow’s appar-
ently inexhaustible stock of good
humor.

Dick may be sitting at his desk,
furiously pounding out an impor-
tant news story, with only a few
minutes to go to an edition dead-
line, when a stray citizen wanders
over and taps him on the shoulder.
“Where,” he asks, “should I go to
get a copy of the Milt Widder
diet?”

Most mortals would have a curt,
clear, friendlosing response. But
Dick pauses graciously, smiles
pleasantly and courteously directs
the stranger to the Public Service
Department. Then his fidgety
fingers resume their ballet on the
typewriter, rushing to make up for
the precious lost moment.

During 17 years on The Press—
with time out to be an advance
rifle scout with infantry at Anzio
and get shot at by the Germans as
he marched through France, Ger-
many and Austria—Dick hasn’t
missed any deadlines, despite his
polite reaction to interruptions.

In the newspaper trade, Dick
McLaughlin is regarded as a
master craftsman. He does some
legwork, and his byline appears on
many sparkling reports, but his
major output is the anonymous
daily grist of heartache, tragedy
and good fortune that is the back-
bone of the daily newspaper.

The tools with which he works
are telephone, typewriter and vo-
cabulary. Press reporters phone in
the facts to Dick, and he deftly
fashions them into vivid, under-
standable accounts.

The piecing together has to be

10

Dick McLaughlin, *35

done at high speed, with maximum
accuracy. Reporters like to turn in
stories to Dick McLaughlin be-
cause he has the knack of polishing
their descriptions into moving
language, and has a sixth sense for
the “human interest angle”—part
of the event that will be most inter-
esting to the average reader.

“I like to write,” he explains
simply. “I never had any desire to
be an executive. This is about the
only kind of work I’ve ever wanted
to do.”

Dick was born at Elyria 39
years ago. His journalistic start
was as a sports writer on the Lake-
wood High Times. He later at-
tended Washington and Lee Uni-
versity and the Medill School of
Journalism at Northwestern Uni-
versity.

The Press is the only newspaper
Dick has ever worked for. He likes
it here, and the feeling is mutual.

“Anything the city desk tells me
to do, Pll do,” is his philosophy.
Some of his assignments were:

Squatting in a tent at the Sta-
dium gate for three days to get the
first bleacher seat to the 1948

 

World Series. He didn’t budge
when the Health department cited
him for camping without a permit.

Running down the Palace Thea-
ter isle in a nightshirt as a stooge
for Olsen and Johnson.

Living on grass and drinking
parsnip coffee to test the edibility of
same.

Carrying a spear in an opera.
Dick’s past includes terms as

book and church editor of The
Press. His week includes writing
“Mac’s Tips for the Week End,”
popular Saturday feature.

Dick’s spare time is chiefly di-
vided between reading books to
himself and funnies to his children,
Richard Jr., 6, and Jamie, 3, in
their home at 20512 Beaconsfield
Road, Rocky River.

Oh yes—he won a Bronze Star
while he was in the 15th Regiment
of the Third Infantry Division,
one of the Army’s most-decorated
units. His explanation of the
award: “Oh, medals were worth
points toward getting you home
faster—so we all got one or two.”

 

Dr. Moger Named Film

Educational Consultant

Dr. Allen W. Moger, professor
of history at Washington and Lee,
has been asked by Coronet Instruc-
tional Films of Chicago to serve as
educational collaborator in the
making of three films on the period
of the American Revolution.

Dr. Moger served as educa-
tional advisor for the company in
the making of the recently com-
pleted film on Robert E. Lee.

The subjects of the three new
films will be the causes of the
Revolution, the colonies in arms,
and the new nation.

These films are being made for
instructional purposes in Amerl-
can history and the social sciences
in schools and colleges.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

(Condensed from an article in
the Richmond Times-Dispatch by
SALLY LEVERTY.)

 

An unsigned portrait of a young
woman in eighteenth century dress
hangs in the museum of the Lee
Memorial Chapel. Against a dark
background the lady lifts her head
proudly. Dark brown hair is
dressed high over the ears, with
two soft curls on the forehead. Her
silver-white brocade gown is made
with pointed basque, and a frill of
fine lace edges the low neckline
which is outlined in gold braid. A
dark blue velvet cloak with lilac-
colored lining is thrown back from
her shoulders. About her neck is
looped a thin gold chain to which
is fastened the miniature pinned
below her breast. The miniature is
the head of George Washington.
Around its narrow gold frame is
inscribed: “George Washington to
His Dear Ann.” Careful scrutiny
reveals that several links of the
chain are missing.

The portrait is thought to be of
Ann Carter Lee, mother of Robert
E. Lee. It has proved impossible
to authenticate it completely, so
the museum authorities have hung
it there without identification. ‘The
portrait was found many years
ago in Italy, and left to the Uni-
versity by Francis Augustus Mc-
Nutt, who bought it in Rome
around 1900.

Dr. Douglas Freeman’s _ bio-
graphy of “R. E. Lee” gives some
background information. Beneath
the reproduction of R. E. Lee’s
father, General “Light Horse
Harry” Lee, is the notation: “No
well authenticated portrait of the
mother of Robert Edward Lee is
known to be in existence, although
what is believed by some to be a
painting of her was found in Rome
several years ago.” The biography,
of course, includes information
about Lee’s mother and her part

in shaping Lee’s life and character.
Robert FE. Lee, born at Stratford in
1807, was the fourth child of Anne
Carter Lee, and “Light Horse
Harry” Lee, brilliant and glamor-
ous hero of the Revolution, special
favorite of George Washington,
member of the Continental Con-
gress, and in 1793, at the time of
their marriage, Governor of Vir-
oinia.

 

Lea Booth Changes Jobs

Lea Boorn, *40, recently staff
head of the Committee on House
Administration, Washington, and
formerly head of public relations

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

 

at Washington and Lee, has ac-
cepted the post of executive secre-
tary of the Virginia Federation of
Independent Colleges, with head-
quarters in Lynchburg, Virginia.
He assumed office on August 1,
1953.

Dr. Gaines is president of the
foundation which is made up of
twelve independent colleges in the
state and was established in 1952
to solicit financial and other sup-
port for the schools. Booth, who
will direct a cooperative public
relations program for the founda-
tion, was described by Dr. Gaines
as having “every quality necessary
for doing a magnificent job.”

Portrait of Robert E. Lee’s Mother? ©

W. and L. Student
Is Author of Novel

A Washington and Lee Univer-
sity junior will be among the new
novelists presented to the American
reading public in 1954. Glenn
Scott, a 20-year-old, crew-cut Vir-
ginian recently signed a contract
with E. P. Dutton and Co., Inc., of
New York for publication of his
first novel, “A Sound of Voices
Dying.”

Scott has aspired to be a writer
since he was 15. His early writing
consisted of mystery stories, and
while attending Smithfield High
School he worked on his father’s
weekly paper, the Smithfield

Times.

He wrote a radio adaptation of
Edgar Allen Poe’s short, “The Cask
of Amontillado” which was broad-
cast over WRVA in Richmond by
the Sound Stage radio group di-
rected by Warner Twyford. The
same group turned down another
script by Scott which was a
science-fiction story involving the
assassination of the President of
the United States. His story was
written before the attempt on Har-
ry Truman’s life.

At Washington and Lee Scott, a
journalism major, has contributed
short stories to the literary mag-
azine, Shenandoah, and to the stu-
dent humor magazine, The South-
ern Collegian, of which he is now
editor.

Scott wrote his 90,000 word
novel during the summer of 1951
between his freshman and sopho-
more years. He worked on it only
for two or three hours each night
since his work on his father’s news-
paper kept him busy during the
day. He averaged more than 1,000
words a night.

In creative writing class under
Dr. George Foster, who is now a
script writer for the Walt Disney
Studio in Hollywood, he revised
his 366 page manuscript. Last year
a Vice-President of E. P. Dutton
and Co. came through Lexington

12

scouting for manuscripts. Scott
submitted his, and three weeks
later received a letter saying that
the company wanted to talk to him
about his book. Subsequent talks
led to the recently signed contract
and a tentative publication date of
February, 1954.

The novel grew out of Scott’s
experiences and observations at
Washington and Lee. It tells the
story of an “ordinary” boy’s growth
and experience at “Philips-White-
head University, a gentleman’s
school in southwestern Virginia.”
Scott says his book is not autobio-
graphical although parts of it may
resemble campus life at Wash-
ington and Lee. The story affirms
the author’s belief that today’s col-
lege youth has a better outlook on
life than the “jazz-age” generation
portrayed by F. Scott Fitzgerald
in the twenties.

The title of Scott’s novel, “A
Sound of Voices Dying,” represents
the theme of the book, that in
growing up, memories of childhood
and adolescence fade away.

Last summer Scott took a tour
of Europe. After he finishes the
necessary revisions on his con-
tracted book, he expects to start
his second novel telling about
American youth in Europe. If his
first novel should click, Virginia
may well have another celebrity to
claim, but don’t tell anyone that
the author in question flunked
English in the sixth grade.

Karly Newspapers
Presented to W&L

Two old Colonial newspapers,
printed on a Boston hand press in
1769, have been presented to the
Lee Memorial Journalism Foun-
dation at Washington and Lee as a
reminder that this free nation has
been built upon a free press.

The two papers, still legible, al-
though almost two centuries old,
are a gift of Dudley A. White,
II, a 1951 journalism graduate,
and now co-publisher along with
his father of the Norwalk, Ohio,
Reflector-Herald. The Whites also
publish the Register-Star-News at
Sandusky, Ohio.

One of the papers is the Boston
weekly News-Letter, printed by
Richard Draper at his printing of-
fice in Newbury Street on Thurs-
day, May 4, 1769. The other is
the Massachusetts Gazette, “pub-
lished by authority” by Draper on
the same day. Both reflect life in
the American colonies at a time
when difficulties with the mother
country were reaching a danger-
ous state and independence was
uppermost in many men’s minds.

O. W. Riegel, director of the
Lee Memorial Journalism Foun-
dation, had both of the old news-
papers permanently preserved.
First, the papers were permeated
with a plastic preservative, then

Director of University Development Appointed

President Gaines has announced
the appointment of Donald E.
Smith, of Worcester, Massachu-
setts, as Director of University De-
velopment at Washington and Lee.

Smith, secretary-treasurer of the
Worcester Polytechnic Institute
Alumni Association, will assume
his duties at Washington and Lee
on September 1.

In announcing Smith’s appoint-
ment to the newly-created post at
Washington and Lee, Dr. Gaines
said Smith will work closely with
the Alumni Association and the
administration in a broad develop-
ment program designed to fit the
university’s growth in its third
century.

Pointing out Smith’s highly suc-
cessful work at W.P.I., Dr. Gaines
said his appointment ended a
thorough search among qualified
college executives for the Wash-
ington and Lee position.

“Mr. Smith’s work at W.P.I. has
been among the most successful in
the United States and I am highly
gratified to have him at Washing-
ton and Lee,” Dr. Gaines said.

As one of the country’s fore-
most alumni executives, Smith
served as chairman of District I
of the American Alumni Council
from 1949 to 1951, and was chair-
man of the General Conference of
the American Alumni Council in
1952 and will serve again in this
capacity in 1954. He served as a
member of the board of directors
of the alumni group in 1949-52.

Smith graduated from W.P.I.
with distinction in 1941, receiving
a bachelor of science degree in
civil engineering. He received his
Master of Arts in education at
Clark University this past June,
his thesis concentrating on develop-
ment offices.

After working in New York City
and Newport News, Virginia, with
engineering concerns Smith re-

14

turned to W.P.I. as an instructor
in civil engineering in 1942.

He taught at New Mexico Col-
lege of A.&M. for one semester,
prior to joining the Navy in 1944.
In the service, Smith served as com-
munications officer aboard the
U.S.S. Maumee, a Navy tanker.

He returned to W.P.I. in 1946
as secretary-treasurer of the
Alumni Association and as editor
of the institute’s alumni magazine.

Smith, 34, 1s married to the
former Miss Nathalie Jewitt, of
Worcester. They have two chil-
dren, David, 5, and Deborah Balch,
32.

 

Local Chapter Meetings

HOUSTON, TEXAS

The first rezular meeting of the
Houston, Texas, chapter of the
W. and L. Alumni Association was
held at River Oaks Country Club
on July 8, 1953, with forty-eight
alumni and wives present. The
Washington and Lee color movie
was shown and very much enjoyed.
Guests of the chapter were: Mr.
and Mrs. Morgan Davis, Mr. and
Mrs. Eugene Peeples and the Rey-
erend Herbert Miller.

Ben Ditto, ’43, president of the
chapter, was re-elected to serve
for another year. Dr. Gaines will

meet with the Houston chupter
in the fall.

CLEVELAND, OHIO

The Cleveland Chapter of
Washington and Lee Alumni held
their spring meeting with a buffet
supper at the home of Dr. John D.
Battle, ’34, 14311 South Wood-
land Road, Shaker Heights, Ohio,
on the evening of June 12, 1953.
About twenty alumni attended,
with several out of town mem-
bers present.

At the business meeting follow-
ing, Paul Holden, ’38, was elected
president, Clinton Van Vliet, 41,
vice-president, Dan Woolridge,
51, treasurer, and Roy Prentiss,
"44. was re-elected secretary. The
outgoing officers, Dr. John Battle,
34, Bill Murray, °41, and Buz
Fraier, ’48, all of whom served at
least two terms, were given a
strong vote of appreciation.

It was decided that the annual
football meeting again be com-
bined with a Cleveland Brown foot-
ball game in November. It was
asked that graduates who return
to Northern Ohio and those who
may move there, contact Roy
Prentiss at Apex Electrical Mfg.
Company, Ulster 1-4200, so they
can be advised of the meeting.

After the meeting the group at-
tended the Indian-Yankee game—
the start of a “lost week-end,” base-
ball wise.
