CONVOCATION ADDRESS

Dr. Nathan M. Pusey, president
of Harvard University and a friend
of Dr. Cole, made the convocation
address which preceded the inaugu-
ration. He congratulated Wash-
ington and Lee for choosing a man
of Dr. Cole’s caliber for its pres-
ident. “At my first meeting with
him—now more than a decade ago,”
he said, “...1 was struck by his
discriminating mind, his manifest
concern for quality, his affection for
people. Since that time I have fol-
lowed with interest his career as
scholar, teacher, author, editor, and
administrative officer and have ob-
served time and again how widely
he is respected for his industry, dis-
cernment, fairness and warm hu-
manity... The moment is full of
promise for this college, for your
state, and for our nation. In choos-
ing Fred Cole, this community evi-
dences a continued awareness of
what makes a good college. You can
rejoice in the leader you have
found; and he in the high oppor-
tunity you offer him for respon-
sible service to quality education.”

Recognizing that “Washington

and Lee has achieved much of its
distinction as an institution dedi-
cated to the liberal arts and _ sci-
ences,’ Dr. Cole, in his inaugural
address, defined the liberal arts and
sciences as “studies that free the
mind, lead to understanding, create
humility and tolerance, and afford
a basis for continuing study and
learning.” ‘These studies historically
differ from “subjects with obvious
utilitarian applications.”

INTEGRITY Is KEY

“Greatness in an institution Is
difficult indeed to achieve or to
maintain,’ Dr. Cole declared. “‘It
requires toil and treasure, with no
practicable or arbitrary limitations
upon either. Yet the one indispen-
sable element of greatness—integri-
ty—is available merely by resolu-
tion to have it and to keep it. It
will not by itself assure greatness;

but an institution or an individual
with it will be much farther along
the road to greatness than one with
far larger physical resources but
without this essential quality.”

Discussing the role of liberal edu-
cation at the college and university
level, Dr. Cole called integrity ‘the
most important consideration in
regard to the objectives of an edu-
cational institution.” It “is subject
to attack and erosion from various
and many sources and causes.” “A
principal danger,’ he warned,
“comes from the demand to fill im-
mediate and specific needs rather
than to supply students with the
basic information and broad _ in-
tellectual, and. scientific, training
necessary for viewing and solving
current problems in proper perspec-
tive and with sound understanding
of causes and consequences.”

‘THREATS TO INTEGRITY

‘Two specific threats to the loss
of integrity today, he said, are ath-
letics and research. He described
how, in many colleges, intercolle-
giate sports have become a form
of popular public entertainment.
Maintaining a nationally promi-
nent athletic position tempts com-
promises with ‘“‘admission — stand-
ards, the curriculum, and the needs
of some academic departments.
When athletics become apart
from—rather than a part of—a col-
lege’s educational program, then
the threat of loss of integrity is
very real indeed.”

“A less recognized aspect of dis-
tortion in education is related to
research,” Dr. Cole declared. “Now
every university of consequence is
expected to have immense research
projects or programs....It must
always be borne in mind that a col-
lege is basically a community of
scholars and _ potential scholars.
Such an institution should not un-
dertake the type of research that
can be pursued most by industrial,
commercial, or governmental lab-

4

’

oratories,’ or any type which will
impose a burden on the college.

HicH STANDARDS

Maintaining the integrity of a
college requires the support of a
certain framework for learning, and
this framework includes adequate
administrative personnel; scholar-
teachers; capable students; and a
comprehensive curriculum.

The new president pointed out
that “a great liberal arts institu-
tion must have well-understood and
well-defined objectives. It must
meet the high standards in all areas
and aspects of its being and _ its
operation. ...in a university dedi-
cated to liberal studies, the curricu-
lum must be broad enough to offer
acquaintance with all major areas
of knowledge and the great ideas
that have shaped the destiny of
man.... The faculty must be ade-
quate to the great task before it. It
is the faculty, more than any other
element, that gives a college or uni-
versity its character and its quality.
The teacher is, after all, the only

unique thing which a college has
to offer. The student body
should be of the quality, size, and
composition which will permit the
instructional objectives to be at-
tained most effectively... . Every
student should have the intellec-
tual and personal capacities, as
well as the academic preparation,
to utilize a college education for
more than ordinary benefit to him-
self and society....We must edu-
cate our young people not merely
for happy living and personal suc-
cess, but for wise and dynamic lead-
ership.”

‘The administrative officers of a
university or college must be dedi-
cated to fostering each of these ele-
ments of greatness,”” he concluded,
“...but nothing in education is
ever really adequate. We can never
know enough; we can never teach
enough; our students can never
learn enough. But we must unceas-
ingly strive to learn more, to teach
more, to get our students to know
more, both by improving instruc-
tional methods and by selection of
capable students who are willing
to work unceasingly.”

Dr. William Pusey, II

Is Newly Appointed
Dean of the College

HEN WASHINGTON and Lee re-
W opens in September, there will
be some familiar faces
places.

Sitting in the dean’s chair will
be Dr. William Webb Pusey, III,
a member of the faculty since 1939,
and now a professor of German. He
will fill the administrative vacancy
created by the resignation last
spring of Dr. Leon F. Sensabaugh
as Dean of the University.

Dr. David W. Sprunt, professor
of religion, will assume the job of
Associate Dean of Students, and
University Chaplain on September
1. He will also continue as an active
teacher.

Dr.-. Pusey, --49 -years--old,: -will
serve as Dean of the College. He
will be the University’s principal
academic officer, but he will not
exercise direct authority over the
deans of Law and the School of
Commerce.

This reflects a change in the ad-
ministrative organization. Previous-
ly, the Dean of the University di-
rected the College of Arts and Sci-
ences, and also was responsible to
the president for affairs of all Wash-
ington and Lee’s academic divi-
sions.

“Because of Washington and
Lee’s traditional and continuing
emphasis on the liberal arts, I think
it is appropriate that the university
have a dean devoted exclusively to
this area of learning, and that this
officer be a man whose training and

in new

experience stem from the liberal
arts,’ President Fred C. Cole de-
clared.

“Dr. Pusey,” he said, “is a scholar
of the first rank, a respected teach-
er and a man of excellent exper-
ience in administrative matters
through his valuable service on
many and varied faculty commit-
tees. By appointing him Dean, we
will not be losing one of our best
teachers, for he will continue to
teach, but I feel that Washington
and Lee will benefit all the more
from his leadership in other func-
tions.”’

Under the new administrative
alignment, Dr. Pusey, commerce
school Dean Lewis W. Adams, and
law school Dean Charles P. Light
will hold equal administrative
status, a situation ‘‘best suited to

the particular needs of Washing-
ton and Lee,” President Cole said.
Dr. Pusey, however, will normally
act in the president’s behalf during
his absence.

Dr. Pusey holds a bachelor’s de-
gree from Haverford College, a
master’s from Harvard, and his doc-
torate from Columbia University.
His major field of study has been
German impressionism, and he has
also specialized in American-Ger-
man literary relations. He is the
author of two books, and numerous
reviews and articles in scholarly
journals. During World War II, he
served in the United States Naval
Reserve, being cited for his work
as an interpreter in interrogation
of the German Naval Command at
the end of the war. Father of two

SUMMER 1960 9

OLLEGE ADMINISTRATORS have
learned to recognize the com-
ing of spring by the multiplication
of undergraduate fads and unsched-
uled extra-curricula. Once every
four years Washington and Lee
students channel this seasonal
energy into a campus-wide produc-
tion which their administrators
feel has real educational value—a
mock political convention held for
the party out of power.

Every four years since 1908, with
only two wartime lapses, they have
staged colorful shows with all the
finesse of polished politicians. And
seven out of eleven times, they have
picked the correct presidential nom-
inees.

Central figure of the 1960 Mock
Democratic convention on May 2
and 3 was former President Harry
S. Truman, who keynoted the
opening session and added authen-
ticity to the partisan enthusiasm.
He was introduced by an _ old
friend, alumnus H. Graham Mor-
ison, class of 1932, chairman of the
1932 Democratic Mock Convention.
In his twenty-two minute speech
Mr. Truman reminded delegates
that, in choosing the man whom we
will select as our next President, we

 

must elect ‘an honorable man, a
man of courage...a man who will
make decisions.” He told the stu-
dents that he would like to return
someday to Washington and Lee to
tell them about the job of being
president, and what it entails.
Joining him on the celebrities’
bench at the convention were two
other well-known _ figures—“‘Miss
America of 1960,” Lynda Lee Mead

ALUMNI

MAGAZINE

of Natchez, Mississippi, and U. S.
Senator Henry M. Jackson of Wash-
ington. Miss Mead, who rode on the
New Jersey float in the pre-con-
vention parade, told the delegates
she felt right at home in a Demo-
cratic gathering, coming from a
state “where there’s no such thing
as a Republican.” Senator Jackson
feared that America is losing the in-
itiative in world affairs because the
present leaders have no clear ideas
of what our purposes are and how
we go about achieving them. He
urged an all-out effort for building
a world community here which
makes room for all peoples and
“for fulfillment of their legitimate
aspirations—for economic progress,
equality of status, freedom and se-
curity.”

During the balloting, presiden-
tial candidates John F. Kennedy,
Lyndon B. Johnson, Stuart Syming-
ton, and Adlai E. Stevenson re-
ceived the largest number of votes,
with Senator Kennedy forging
ahead on the sixth ballot to win.
Senator Jackson was named by the

Kennedy, on the third ballot.

over the convention, then settled
down on the laps of some stu-
dents’ wives to be petted; an un-
wieldly batch of large gas-filled bal-
loons marked LB] for Senator
Johnson, which escaped a delega-
tion and went sailing to the ceiling
of Doremus gymnasium; a_ toy
motorized car filled with students,
which cruised up and down the
aisles when things got dull.

The pre-convention parade was
led by Mr. Truman and Dr. Fred C.
Cole, president of Washington and
Lee, riding in a huge open 1940
Dusenberg. An estimated 20,000
spectators cheered the 75 floats and
twelve bands which wound their
way through Lexington’s streets.

One of the highlights of the
parade happened in front of the
President's Home, where the dig-
nitaries were seated, when two
ornery mules pulling the Oklahoma
float, a covered wagon, stopped sud-
denly and refused to go on. Spec-
tators shouted advice while riders
in the prairie schooner implored

the mules to move. Finally two col-
legians mounted the animal’s backs
and succeeded in starting them
again, ‘midst cheers and laughter.

Mr. ‘Truman’s last official act at
the convention was to participate
in the dedication of a memorial
plaque to the memory of former
Vice-President Alben W. Barkley,
who died of a heart attack in 1956
while delivering the keynote ad-
dress at the Mock Convention in
Lexington. The plaque was pre-
sented by the Washington and Lee
student body.

Organization and planning of the
convention was ably carried out by
a steering committee of five law
school students and two under-
graduates, who had worked all year
in planning the project. They were:
Charles L. McCormick, III, chair-
man; F. William Ling, Thomas B.
Bryant, II, Thomas B. Branch, III,
Warren H. Goodwyn, Peyton B.
Winfree, III, and Jon B. McLin.

New Financial Aid Program Is Established

BROAD NEW student financial
A aid program will go into effect
at Washington and Lee in Septem-
ber.

Named to direct the new _ pro-
gram is James D. Farrar, '49, assis-
tant dean of students for eight
years, who now becomes Director
of Student Financial Aid and Schol-
arships.

The plan will offer expanded
scholarship aid and loan assistance
to a substantially increased number
of students, President Fred C. Cole
said.

Key feature of the program is a
student loan system through which
a student can borrow up to five-
eighths of the cost of his college
education from Washington and
Lee, with the remaining three-
eighths covered by outright schol-
arship assistance. The ratio of
scholarship and loan aid will vary
in accordance with funds available
and experience with the program.

Dr. Cole said he hoped the pro-
gram eventually will place a Wash-
ington and Lee education within
the grasp of a greater number of
superior high school graduates, re-
gardless of their financial resources.

As director, Mr. Farrar will work
with the existing faculty scholar-
ship committee in all matters in-
volving scholarships, student loan
funds, and campus and off-campus
job opportunities for students.

President Cole emphasized that
the loan plan will supplement, not
replace, Washington and Lee’s cur-
rent strong program of endowed
scholarships. Endowed scholarship
assistance will provide 41 freshmen
entering in September with aid

12

 

JAmes D. Farrar, °49, program director

totaling $33,080 for the 1960-61
school year. ‘This year, 200 Wash-
ington and Lee undergraduates—
20 per cent of the enrollment—re-
ceived $155,115 in university ad-
ministered aid, an average of $775
per student.

Seventeen 1960-61 applicants for
scholarship help have been offered
combination scholarship-loans un-
der the new aid program.

President Cole explained the
scholarship-loan system this way:

An applicant will have 75 per
cent of his needs covered by schol-
arship funds and 25 per cent by a
loan during his freshman year. As
a sophomore, the division will be
50-50, and as a junior he will re-
ceive only 25 per cent scholarship
aid, but 75 per cent loan assistance.
His senior year all help will be on
a loan basis.

Loans will be made on a basis of

three per cent, with no interest
charged while the student is in
school. ‘The graduate has ten years
in which to pay off his indebted-
ness, President Cole said.

He said the system is similar to
loan programs now in use at other
colleges, and is also similar to the
federal aid to education loan. sys-
tem.

The president, who helped set up
a similar program when he was aca-
demic vice-president of ‘Tulane
University, said the venture will be
bound by “no rigid rules.”

“We shall be establishing princi-
ples now,’ he pointed out. “We
shall need to learn from experience.
I see no reason why such a scholar-
ship-loan system, continued on a
proper basis, cannot become as
good as any in this country.”

He said during the early stages
of its application, the program will
benefit largely high-qualified schol-
arship applicants for whom there
are not enough endowed scholar-
ships to go around. As resources be-
come available, Washington and
Lee hopes to be able to extend
scholarship loans to more and more
applicants who need assistance to
attend.

“As always, we shall expect the
student to pay as much of his own
expense as possible,” President Cole
declared. “But if we can move
ahead in this program, we shall be
able to say to any student in the
United States that if he wants to
come to Washington and Lee and
if he can meet our normal entrance
requirements, he can come despite
any economic limitations he may
have.”

Capital Fund Drive Passes
‘Two Million Mark

VER TWO AND ONE-HALF years
() ago, Washington and Lee
University began its first concerted
campaign for capital funds. Exten-
sive preliminary surveys to deter-
mine the University’s long range
expenditures gave priority to the
construction and equipping of a
new building for physics, biology,
geology, an addition to Howe Hall
for modern efficiency in teaching
chemistry, and the renovation or
remodeling of Reid Hall for jour-
nalism and pre-engineering.

Since the drive for capital funds
began in July, 1958, gifts have been
received from over 4,000 alumni,
parents, and friends of the Univer-
sity from all over the country. The
co-operative progress which these
gifts represent was realized when
it was announced on May 81 that
the campaign for capital funds had
passed the $2,000,000 mark. Of
this amount $1,500,000 has been
designated for new physics, geol-
ogy, biology, pre-engineering and
journalism facilities toward the
goal of $2,000,000 for these build-
ings. Approximately $500,000 has
been donated to the University’s
endowment, the income to be used
chiefly for scholarships and faculty
salaries.

Campaigns involving intensive
solicitation were planned for 44
different geographical areas which
had a concentration of 100 or more
alumni, friends, and parents. Of
these 44 areas, 37 have been com-

g THE LEE HOUSE, home of Wash-
ington and Lee’s presidents since
1869, has undergone extensive re-
pair and remodeling work during
the past months. ‘The job of pre-
serving the home as an_ historical
landmark began last fall and was
completed in time for President
Fred CG. Cole and his family to
move into during early May.
Original cost of the house was
$15,000, and money for its construc-
tion was raised through public sub-
scription throughout the country.

14

It is thought that General Robert
E. Lee planned much of the house,
with the assistance of his son, Gen-
eral George Washington Custis Lee.
The two-story brick Greek Revival
home looks today much the same
on the exterior as it did g1 years
ago.

The house had advanced ideas
for its time, about heating and cool-
ing. The walls were built in three
layers of brick, with air space be-
tween the second and third layers—
a natural insulation. ‘There was
also a system of vents which could
be opened and closed by small
latches.

In shoring up the home, work-
men repaired and replaced timbers,
added supports in the basement,
and made extensive repairs to the
interior walls and floors. ‘The ex-
terior brick work and mortar were
in good condition and were not
touched.

The house has been air-condt-
tioned on the first and second
floors, and modern conveniences ad-
ded to make the dwelling more
livable. However, as much as_ pos-
sible was done to retain the tradi-
tional atmosphere of the historic
structure.

s THE BINOCULARS used by General
Robert E. Lee throughout the Civ-
il war have been presented to Lee
Museum here, the gift of Mrs.
George Bolling Lee of San Francis-
co, California, widow of General
Lee’s grandson.

The field glasses are still in ex-
cellent condition. Apparently the
binoculars did not fit the leather
case as well as General Lee wished,
for a wadding of paper in the bot-
tom of the case was found. ‘The pa-
per was a blank Confederate Army
printed form, entitled ‘Enlisted
Men on Extra or Day Duty.”

 

m AN HISTORICAL study of education-
al techniques through the ages has
been written by Dr. Edward D.
Myers, chairman of the department
of philosophy. His book, “Eudca-
tion in Perspective of History,” was
written against the background of
Arnold J. ‘Toynbee’s monumental
“A Study of History,” and the not-
ed British philosopher-historian has
provided the concluding chapter to
the book.

Dr. Myers and Professor ‘Toynbee
are personal friends, having col-
laborated on an eleventh, gazetteer,
volume to ‘Toynbee’s “Study of
History.” Since 1958, Dr. Myers has
been on leave as cultural attache

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

for the U.S. Information Agency at

The book, published by Harper

tion’s methuds of handing down the
accumulated experience, knowl-
edge, and wisdom of humanity
from generation to generation, trac-
ing cultural heritages through nine-
teen societies over the past 5,000
years.

Dr. Myers will return from Bonn
in September, to resume his teach-
ing duties here.

m DR. WILLIAM M. HINTON, 29, head
of the department of education and
psychology, has been chosen presi-
dent-elect of the Southern Society
for Philosophy and Psychology. He
will succeed Dr. Rubin Gotesby of
the University of Georgia, when
the group meets next year at At-
lanta, Georgia.

Dr. Hinton served the organiza-
tion as treasurer in 1952-54, and
since 1957 has been a member of
the executive council.

a “PRELUDE FOR STRINGS,” a compo-
sition by a Washington and Lee
professor, was heard recently at a
composers’ conference and sympos-
ium at the University of Alabama.

The prelude is the work of Rob-
ert Stewart, assistant professor of
fine arts, and is scored for a full
symphonic string orchestra. The
specially augmented University of
Alabama Symphony played the
work, directed by Julius Hegyi,
conductor of the Chattanooga
Symphony. Stewart was, before com-
ing to Washington and Lee, on the
stall of the American Conservatory
of Music in Chicago for fourteen
years.

a month-long study tour of West
Germany and West Berlin, as guest
of the West German government,
along with a group of other Ameri-
can professors.

Dr. Edgar W. Spencer, geology
department head, is spending the
summer in research in Europe, on
a John M. Glenn grant. He will at-

# A HIGH HONOR from the Garden
Club of Virginia was bestowed in
May upon Frank J. Gilliam, ’17,
dean of students, and Mrs. Gilliam
for their “outstanding contribu-
tion” toward making the state “a
more beautiful place.” They were
jointly awarded the Massie Award
for 1960, an award for outstanding
achievement in horticulture.

Mrs. Gilliam is a former presi-
dent of the Garden Club of Vir-
ginia and has served many years on
its restoration committee.

The citation said, in part,
“Theirs has been a lifetime devoted
to man’s most rewarding recreation
of growing and living beauty, horti-
culture, and they have started un-
told hundreds of people down this
happy road....”

Only once before has the 31-year-
old award been given to a husband
and wife team. Usually it goes to
a member club of the group.

 

 

m BEGINNING NEXT year, undergrad-
uate tuition wil be raised by $50
per year over a projected five year
period, with the increased income
being applied to faculty salaries,
scholarship and loan asssitance for
deserving students, and to other
areas of the instructional program.

Under a schedule approved by
the Board of Trustees, the tuition
rate will continue $750 in 1960-61,
but will be raised to $800 in 10961-
62; $850 the following year, and so
on til $1,000 is reached in 1965-66.
This schedule is subject to revision
by the board, if conditions change
significantly, President Fred C. Cole
said.

With the new schedule in effect,
all existing laboratory fees are due
for abolishment. These range any-
where from five to thirty-six dol-
lars per year.

When Washington and Lee’s tui-
tion level reaches $1,000 per year,
it will be in line or below average
undergraduate tuition costs already
in effect in comparable colleges and
universities in the South, East, and
Midwest, Dr. Cole pointed out.

mw COMPANIES SEEKING new personnel
from among the 1960 graduates ex-
ercised more selectivity this year, re-
ports placement director James D.
Farrar, ‘40.

He noted a tendency among
many firms to make fewer job of-
fers, but the offers generally were
more attractive and seemed de-
signed to interest and hold the very
best men of the class. Grades were
not a major consideration—firms
were looking for evidences of ma-
turity and an eagerness to locate
permanently in a promising field.
About 75 of the 180 academic
seniors signed up with the place-
ment office for interviews this year,
Mr. Farrar said.

Starting salaries were up slightly
from last year’s offers, with the av-
erage around $425 monthly.

m THE SAP WAS beginning to rise in
the shade trees around Washington
and Lee’s campus on April 27,
which might have passed like any
April 27, except that a group of
students discovered it was the 138th
birthday of Ulysses S. Grant.

So, “just to even things up a bit,”
as one participant explained, the
gay undergraduates celebrated the
birthday in high style at the school
once headed by Grant’s Civil War
foe.

A cake with 138 candles was
served from in front of Lee Chapel,
and banners reading “Happy Birth-
day, Ulysses” were strung in front
of the chapel and from the fresh-
man dormitory. ‘This was a “nice”
thing to do, one student said, since
Washington and Lee always ob-
serves Lee’s birthday with a _ holli-
day.

m JAMES NEAL HARDIN, ’60,_ of
Greeneville, Tennessee, was named
a Fulbright Scholar for 1960-61, to
study German literature at the Free
University of Berlin. His grant was
one of some goo awards for gradu-
ate study abroad made under the
State Department’s International

Educational Exchange Program. He
was a Phi Beta Kappa member and
a German major at Washington

mw THE 1960 CALYX was dedicated to
Dr. Clayton Epes Williams, ‘12,
who retired in June as dean of the
Law School, after a 40-year career
as a teacher here.

The dedication read, “In every
university there are professors who
will be remembered long after the
knowledge which they have impart-
ed becomes merely a link in the

long chain of life education. Clay-
ton Epes Williams, ... realizes this
ideal. In his many years of out-
standing service to Washington and
Lee, Dean Williams, has earned
both the respect and admiration of
his students and colleagues as an
educator, an administrator, and an
individual.

“His tireless efforts and unceas-
ing guidance have been responsible
for a new phase in the history of
our Law School. Since becoming
Dean in 1944, he has brought about
vast improvements in the curricu-
lum, the facilities, and in the qual-
ity of teaching. The fine showing of
Washington and Lee’s moot court
teams, which during the past few
years have consistently ranked very
high nationally; the completion last
year of the Davis Law Dormitory,
which has long been one of his
coveted goals; and the introduc-
tion of the John Randolph ‘Tucker
Lectures, which have attracted to
our campus some of the nation’s
foremost judges, attorneys, and edu-
cators, are but a few of the mani-
fold achievements exemplary of the

fraternity. He was one of fifteen
honor graduates nominated from
the fraternity’s provinces in the
United States and Canada. Among
finalists were students from Yale,
‘Tulane, Ohio State, San Francisco,
Emory and other colleges.

Frank is from Warrington, Flor-

South at Sewanee, and won a
Woodrow Wilson Fellowship. He
earned a master’s degree in foreign
affairs at the University of Vir-

Norfolk, Virginia. He planned to
stay in for several years, gather
some savings, and then go to col-
lege. But World War II came along,
then the Korean War, and he de-
cided to “go for twenty years.” A
chief boatswain’s mate, he stayed in
two years beyond his goal.

He gathered college credits when-
ever possible. When he was in port,
he would swap duty watches with
shipmates, to be free for night
school. He took courses at William

m CY’ TWOMBLY was just about the
most pepped up man in Lexington
on the morning of July 5. He greet-
ed nearly everyone he met with his
big, wide grin and a_ loud-voice,
‘How about those Washington and
Lee boys!”

He was talking of Ned Baber, ’59,
of Richmond, and Frank Summers,
Jv., 52, of Staunton. Baber, 23, had
just won the Virginia State Ama-
teur Golf Championship with a
tremendous, 1-up victory in a
Fourth of July finals that went 39
holes over the famous Cascades
Course at Hot Springs. Summers,
29, was the tourney’s medalist in
the qualifying rounds with a two-
under par 69, only the second sub-
70 qualifying score posted in re-
cent years.

Both young men had played on
Washington and Lee’s varsity golf
team under ‘Twombly, and Baber
was the captain of the team that
posted a g-2 mark in dual matches
and went on to win the state col-
legiate championship in 1959. Sum-
mers, who was a three-year letter-
man in baseball before turning to
golf while in law school, played
only one season for ‘Twombly. Cy
remembers him as the only boy he
ever coached to win eleven matches
without a defeat.

Baber, now a banking trainee in
Richmond but a native of Lynch-
burg, had an easy time of it through
his first four matches in the 64-play-
er championship flight. But in the
semi-finals, he never led until the
20th hole, when he blasted out of
a trap to within a balls’ turn of

17

the cup and edged Ronnie Gerring-
er, the state high school champion.

Up against another teenager,
Wright Garrett of Danville, in the
finals, Baber grabbed a four-up lead
after the first 18, but saw his ad-
vantage fade when Garrett won the
three final holes to pull all even
after 36 holes. Garrett’s hole-win-
ning putt on the 36th went past
the cup, stopped, and then rolled
back several inches to drop. But
Baber wasn’t shaken, and_ three
extra holes later, he rolled in a
14-inch putt for his big victory.

Summers whose medalist honors
at Hot Springs and a recent third-
place finish in the State Open make
him one of Virginia’s hottest ama-
teurs, went out in the fourth
round against Garrett.

The summer golf triumphs of
Twombly’s former stars were some
measure of consolation for the
Washington and Lee coach whose
1960 varsity team stumbled to a so-
SO, 4-2-2 season, and a fifth-place
state tournament finish. Highlight
of the season was the crackerjack
play of sophomore Jack Vardaman.
He was medalist in the Greenbrier
college tournament and a_ co-
medalist in the state affair.

The big news in college sports
this spring was the continued out-
standing performance of Karl
“Skip” Rohnke, whose — record-
breaking javelin marks led the
Generals to an _ undefeated, 7-0,
dual meet season in track.

Rohnke, a_ broad - shouldered
Southern Californian, established
a new school javelin record with a
throw of 211 feet, 3 inches. Com-
peting against some of the best men
in the country in several invitation-
al relays, he failed to win any first
places, but he was always among
the top three or four.

For his efforts, which during his
four Years at Washington and Lee
earned him four letters each in
soccer, swimming, and __ track,
Rohnke was accorded the top ath-
letic honors the school bestows.

NED BABER, 759, reflects on a championship putt

He was named “most valuable
athlete of the year,” and he won
the Forest Fletcher Memorial
Track award for the third time. But
perhaps the biggest tribute of all
was his winning the Francis ‘T.
“Wink” Glasgow II Memorial ‘Tro-
phy, awarded the senior “who has
best displayed Washington and Lee
spirit and sportsmanship over his
four-year college career.”

In other sports, Coach Bill Wash-
burn’s tennis team won 8, lost only
3, and got superlative play from

juniors Billy McWilliams and
Clark Valentiner.
Other spring sports suffered

long seasons. Coach Bob McHenry’s
lacrosse men boasted two jim- dan-
dies in midfielder Jay Stull and at-
tack man Skip Horst, but the rest
of the squad generally lack exper-
ience. The final record of 2 wins, 6
losses and a tie doesn’t reflect the
heights the team did arise to on
occasion.

Washington and Lee’s baseball
fortunes began a long, hard road
back to respectability under new
coach Joe Lyles. ‘The team lacked
consistent hitting in the early sea-

son, but junior right-hander Roy
Carpenter again was a better pitch-
er than his winless record reflected.
Carpenter lost four one-run decis-
ions, and his earned-run average
was one of the lowest in the state.

Junior Phil Sharp, another right-
hander, won all three of the Gen-
erals’ victories, including a heroic
13-Inning 1-0 victory over West
Virginia in the season finale. Coach
Lyles, a former professional pit-
cher, is taking consolation in the
fact that most of his 1960 boys will
return next year and that this sea-
son’s 3-17 record was better than the
1-15 mark posted in 1959.

Looking ahead to fall and foot-
ball, there’s an atmosphere of ex-
pectant optimism at Washington
and Lee. ‘The Generals face a nine-
game schedule—the same opponents
as 1959 with the addition of Johns
Hopkins—and the season should be
a winning one if things go as plan-
ned. Thirty-three of the 1959 squad
of 38 varsity players are scheduled
to return, and there are some val-
uable reinforcements on hand from
last year’s frosh squad, as well as a
good crop of 1960 freshmen.

The Alumni Association President Says:

Continued Progress Depends Upon Support

By Pryton B. WINFREE, ‘35

HIS MEETING marks the end of
my third year as a member of
the Alumni Board of Trustees and
my one year in which I have served
as your President. During this peri-
od I have considered myself most
fortunate to have had the pleasant
association, to have met the inter-
esting and challenging projects and
to have had the intimate contact
with the affairs of the University.
The Alumni Board has been very
busy about the affairs of your As-
sociation. In addition to the regu-
lar fall and spring meetings, your
Board of ‘Trustees has had two spe-
cial meetings with a committee
from the University Board of ‘Trus-
tees to review chiefly the relation-
ship of the Alumni Association to
the University and its Board of
Trustees and to foster a continued
and enlivened liason between the
two organizations. I should like to
say that the members of the Alumni
Board have tried to represent the
varied views of alumni but with
due regard for the responsibility of
the constituted authorities. It has
seemed to us that the proper func-
tion of an alumni association is to
act as a counsellor, not fostering
discord but remembering always
that this is our University through
thick and thin. I am pleased to re-
port that these meetings with the
University Committee have met
with much progress and to point
out that our University President,
Dr. Cole, has been at these meet-
ings and contributed greatly to
their success.
In conjunction with this review

SUMMER 1960

of relationship, we are engaged in
a project to revise and adjust the
By-Laws of the Association. At this
stage of deliberation, however,
there is nothing definite to report.

The Executive Secretary and the
Alumni office staff, in addition to
the absolute maze of regular duties,
have been in the midst of strenuous
activities with cooperating efforts
in the University Development Pro-
gram and in the recent outstanding
inauguration ceremonies. At this
last mentioned event, I might add,
there were some one hundred alum-
ni delegates representing each
chapter, each class, each geograph-
ic area and among whom were four
or more university presidents.

As reported by the Secretary, I
am glad to say that the Alumni
Fund, sparked by the Fund Coun-

 

PEYTON WINFREE, President, 1959-60

cil, has been successful in view of
its curtailed and limited operations.
The mere fact that this Fund Cam-
paign was conducted under limited
conditions and to only certain cate-
gories of alumni, imposed some dif-
ficult tasks on the office staff and
Secretary. The reactivation of our
Alumni Fund is of utmost import-
ance. For the continued progress of
this proudly independent university
depends increasingly upon _ the
steady, annual, and generous sup-
port of her alumni. I hope that
each of us, as we complete our
pledge or obligation to the Build-
ing Campaign, will renew with in-
creased interest and vigor our reg-
ular schedule of giving to the
Alumni Fund.

Finally, I might report that while
the much discussed Alumni House
is not yet a reality, we have man-
aged to keep the idea alive in the
thinking of the University and in
view of its development plans. In
light of these plans and the general
welfare of the University we are
hopeful this thinking will be fruit-
ful.

In closing, I might project this
thought: If the success of a college
were measured, as is success in a
business, by the number of satisfied
customers, then Washington and
Lee would be considered a “blue
chip stock,” for I surely believe it
would be difficult to find anyone
who graduated or attended this in-
stitution for any length of time who
does not feel grateful, proud, and
honored to be an alumnus of this
University.

The Alumni Secretary Reports:

Another Successful Year for the Association

By WILLiAM C. WASHBURN, '40

HIS IS THE second time I have
‘T been privileged to bring the
alumni a brief report and happily
it is again a report of continued
progress. ‘his year’s report is
marked, I think, by several signif-
icant events, the most important of
which was the change in Univer-
sity administration culminating in
the inauguration of President Cole
on May ¥.

First of all, organizational wise,
our association has prospered. This
time last year I reported a newly in-
stalled chapter in Hagerstown,
Maryland. ‘This chapter is now well
established and, I might add, Presi-
dent Cole is scheduled to meet with
that chapter on June 10. We now
have 37 chapters, all of whom have
had at least one meeting and most
of whom have had many meetings
of great interest and with fine spirit.
At this moment there is movement
under foot to install two new chap-
ters— one in the Wilmington, Dela-
ware area, the other in Tulsa, Okla-
homa. ‘Though the summer, due to
vacations, is a hard time to organize
such things—much ground work has
been done and we hope to have
these two chapters in operation
next school year.

MANY VISITATIONS

By virtue of the University De-
velopment Program and its cam-
paign in various areas, I have been,

20

along with Dr. Gaines or President
Cole and James Whitehead, quite
busy in visitations to these chap-
ters. It has been my _ pleasure
now to have visited all but one of
our chapters and this one is on the
schedule for this summer or early
September. While on the subject of
University Development, I would
like this opportunity to express
publicly my deep appreciation for
the splendid cooperation of Jim
Whitehead and his Development
staff. They have worked hand in
glove with the Alumni Office and
have been a maximum value to the
alumni chapters and their activities.

 

New President PAUL M. SHUFORD, "43

I have nothing but highest praise
and deepest thanks for all their
help. The mere momentum of this
program is bringing about renewed
interest and vigor in the alumni
chapters.

Of particular worthy note, is the
practice of the chapters to help in
admissions and recruitment of
promising boys for Washington
Lee. Practically all now have a pro-
gram for active work on this; also,
to assist the University in seeking
and awarding young men_ with
scholarship aid. Often the chapters
invite to their meetings the boys
who have been accepted for admis-
sion, as well as their parents. In
some cases this year, such as in
Memphis and Baltimore, chapters
have helped sponsor community
programs of utmost importance and
have assisted such University or-
ganizations as the Glee Club to put
on programs in their town or area.
All of these activities, I assure you,
are of infinite value to your alma
mater.

FUND REACTIVATION

During this past year it became
evident that it was expedient to re-
activate the Alumni Fund even
though the Development Campaign
had not been completed. The
Alumni Fund Council, under Dick
Smith, met in November on short
notice and under their guidance

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

and direction a plan was estab-
lished, designed not to interfere
with the Development Campaign.
All alumni were separated by cate-
gories: (1) those who were under
pledge to the Development Cam-
paign, (2) those who had made a
gift and completed it, (3) and those
who had the opportunity to make a
gift but who had not. This was no
easy task, I assure you, when each
day new receipts would change the
situation. Some mistakes and over-
lapping occurred; we hope not
many and we are indeed sorry
where they did. Through all of this,
the Development Office cooperated
to the fullest extent.

My hat is off to our wonderful
group of Class Agents who so quick-
ly came to our aid and who so
splendidly wrote not only to those
members of their class who were
considered eligible for the fund but
also a letter of greetings to each of
their classmates. This action result-
ed in the strengthening of class ties
and the maintenance of our Class
Agent Plan. Also, four of these
agents were most instrumental in
promoting the Class Reunions
which I'll mention later.

As of May 31, (the Fund year
does not close until June 30) the
Alumni Fund has a record of 707
contributors and $19,564.44. While
this is a long way from our record
of the last full scale campaign of
some 3300 contributors and nearly
$100,000.00, in view of the circum-
stances I think there is room for
satisfaction and encouragement.
Keep in mind that in the past two
years the alumni of this college
have supported the Development
Program with a record of 3,859 con-
tributors for $1,027,417.00. Inciden-
tally, I might add that the total
figure for the Development Fund
as of this date is $2,035,000.00.
These figures have not been audit-
ed, as that will be done later, but
as far as our records indicate, this
is the picture so far and one of
which IJ think we can all be proud.

Dr. JOHN D. BATTLE, ’34, was elected to
Alumni Board of Trustees.

STUDENT RELATIONS

There are many other activities
on which I could comment at some
length but for sake of brevity I
would just like to mention our
Student-Relation area in which we
participate at freshman camp and
make an award to the boy who up-
holds the tradition of knowing the
most names; Homecoming, where
the Association makes four awards
to the winners of the fraternity
house decoration contest; our ban-
quet in May in honor of the
seniors. These phases grow increas-
ingly important each year.

Our annual Anniversary Class
Reunions are now an established
program. Following the desires of
the majority of our members who
felt that 25 years was a long time
to wait for a special class reunion,
we began this year with our first
Tenth year convocation and reun-
ion. It was a great success! In fact,
the whole reunion, which saw four
classes back on campus, was won-
derfully supported and was a high-
light of the year.

One final comment about our
Alumni Magazine. This is the wid-
est channel of communication be-
tween alumni themselves and the

 

WILLIAM B. WIspom, ’21, was elected to
Alumni Board of Trustees.

University. Our mailing today is
roughly 10,600 per issue. ‘This year
we put out a fifth issue which was
devoted almost entirely to scholar-
ships, what part alumni could play,
and what help they could give. We
have tried to keep you abreast of
the news and affairs of the Univer-
sity and of your fellow classmates
and alumni. My deep appreciation
goes to Mrs. Jeffrey, our managing
editor, and Mr. Harold Lauck of
our printing laboratory for their
interest and cooperation.

In closing please let me try very
simply to extend my thanks to
all who have helped. It’s dangerous
to list, and I hope I shall not over-
look any: but first, let me congratu-
late you on your officers who have
given unselfishly of their time and
talents. My thanks to the Admin-
istration and faculty and especially
President Cole; to the Development
Office, the Faculty-Alumni Commit-
tee; to the Class Agents, the Chap-
ter Officers—and in fact to each
alumnus, I extend my deep appre-
ciation.

And to my office staff, a special
thanks.

I have enjoyed this year of pro-
gress and look forward with pleas-
ure to the coming year.

New Officers Announced

General Alumni Association

Meeting Is Held on June 2, 1960

HE GENERAL ALUMNI Association

meeting was held on June g,
1960, in duPont auditorium, with
a good representation of alumni
present. Peyton S. Winfree, ’35,
president of the association, pre-
sided.

Reports of the president, execu-
tive secretary, and treasurer were
read (as printed on other pages in
this magazine). In the absence of E.
Angus Powell, ’36, chairman of the
Nominating Committee, Bernard
Levin, ’42, read the names of the
two nominees for the Alumni
Board of Trustees for a three-year
term: William B. Wisdom, ’21, of
New Orleans; and Dr. John D. Bat-
tle, 34, of Cleveland; for represen-
tative on the University Committee
on Intercollegiate Athletics, to serve
two years: A. Lea Booth, ’40, of
Lynchburg, Virginia. These men
were elected by acclamation.

At the call for new business, Dr.
Amos L. Herold, ’og, of Austin,
Texas, spoke briefly and presented
eleven resolutions in behalf of his
contention that the Association
should be independent from the
University, as follows:

“Whereas the Alumni Associa-
tion, Inc., of Washington and Lee
University in its regular annual ses-
selon of 1960 in Lexington, Vir-
ginia, has learned the full signif-
icance of a Resolution Adopted
by the Alumni Board of Trustees

22

on October 25, 1952, which violates
the 1910 Charter of the Association
and commits it to continuous beg-

_ gary and and near bankruptcy un-

worthy of its membership; now
therefore, be it resolved by the As-
sociation.

“1. That the Alumni Board of
‘Trustees is hereby instructed to re-
scind the aforesaid Resolution; and
that, beginning July 1, 1960, all
funds collected by the authority
and in the name of this Associa-
tion by its officers and agents and
all other undesignated income shall
be deposited to the credit of the
Alumni Association, Inc., in a re-
liable bank of Lexington, Virginia,
for the payment of the Association’s
necessary operating expenses.

“2. ‘That, at the end of this pres-
ent fiscal year on June 30, 1960,
and annually thereafter, any bal-
ance remaining to the credit of this
Association shall be held as a sur-
plus, year by year, until the total
savings amount to $100,000 or
more, which may then be used for
acquiring an Alumni Headquarters
Building and its endowment.

“9. That near the end of each
fiscal year, a committee consisting
of the President, Secretary, and
‘Treasurer of this Association shall
prepare a detailed budget of the As-
sociation’s business for the follow-

ing year for the approval of the
Alumni Board of Trustees at its
first annual session; and that an-
nual audits be made.

“4. That hereafter the Alumni
Editor shall promptly publish in
the Alumni Magazine all Resolu-
tions and By-Laws affecting vital
alumni business and interests for
the information of alumni mem-
bers, and shall seek to improve the
Alumni Magazine as suggested in
‘Constructive Proposals.’

“5. That, to avoid disfranchising
many alumni who live at a distance
from the University, voting by
proxy shall be re-established in the
Charter and By-Laws.

“6. That the Board of Trustees
is hereby instructed to revise By-
Law Article VII (b), which defines
the powers of the Treasurer of this
Corporation, by striking out the
destructive provision, ‘except as
otherwise provided by action of the
Board of Trustees.’

“7. That the prohibition in the
By-Laws limiting Trustees to one
term shall be removed for the bene-
fit of this Association, and that it
pay the traveling expenses of Trus-
tees to Board Meetings.

“8. That both the Alumni Secre-
tary and the active Treasurer shall
be fully bonded and shall jointly

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

sign all pay checks of this Corpora-
tion.

“g. That, beginning January 1,
1961, the Alumni Magazine shall be
sent only to alumni members who
contribute a minimum of two dol-
lars to the funds of the Association
for the following year.

“10. That, at an early date, both
the Association’s Charter and _ its
By-Laws shall be revised to conform
to authorized changes in them and
accurately republished for the use
and information of all alumni.

“1. That the Alumni Staff be
enlarged and strengthened by the
addition of one well-qualified, full-
time alumnus editor, who could al-
so function as assistant treasurer.”
He then moved adoption of his pro-
posals.

Charles H. Davidson, ’32, made a
motion that any and all of the reso-
lutions that had not already been
voted upon by the Alumni Board
of Trustees be referred to that
board for further consideration and
report, but that none be adopted
at this time. He moved further that
Dr. Herold be thanked for his in-
terest. The motion was unanimous-
ly approved.

New officers of the association
were announced for the year 1960-
61 as follows: president, Paul M.
Shuford, ’43; vice-president, Ber-
nard Levin, ’42; treasurer, James B.
Martin, ’31.

Mr. Shuford spoke briefly, ex-
plaining that the Alumni Board
has under consideration a plan to
enlarge the membership of the
Board and extend their terms of of-
fice. A formal proposal for a change
in the charter may be ready by the
next meeting, he said. He also stat-
ed that greater emphasis is being
directed toward a more active pro-
gram within the chapters and _ be-
tween the chapters and the Unz1-
versity. He said, in answer to Dr.
Herold, that annual budgets for the
Association are made up and the
books are audited each year.

Head of Ballyache Syndicate Was

A Good Runner as a Student

EWS WAS MADE recently when
N a syndicate, headed by Joseph
Lee Arnold, °37L, bought the fa-
mous race horse, Ballyache for
$1,250,000.

Mr. Arnold is now a Kentucky
lawyer and a real estate developer,
but old friends at Washington and
Lee recall that he was a pretty fair
runner himself, when he was a colt
at the University.

Chauncy Durden’s column in the
Richmond Times Dispatch reprint-
ed in part below, explains that
Jor ARNOLD, head of the syndicate
that recently bought Ballyache for
$2,250,000 was a pretty fair runner
himself when he was a colt at Wash-
ington and Lee. Mr. Arnold is now
a Kentucky lawyer and real estate
developer.

Arnold, a native of Danville,
Ky., was “recruited” for Washing-
ton and Lee the summer of 1932 by
Charles McDowell, professor of law
at Washington and Lee. Professor
McDowell had taught (and coached
basketball) at Centre College in
Danville before becoming a mem-
ber of Washington and Lee’s Law
faculty. Each summer Professor Mc-
Dowell returned to Danville with
his family. During these summer va-
cations in Kentucky the professor
“influenced” several good Kentucky
athletes to enroll at Washington
and Lee.

Columnist McDowell, recalling
those boyhood days, said “Every
time we returned from Danville (to
Lexington, Va.) Dad had one or
two Kentucky boys in the car with

24

 

the four of us.”’ (Professor and Mrs.
McDowell, Charles, Jr., and John.)
Warren E. “Tex” Tilson, who

coached the Washington and Lee
football teams during the ’30’s, said
of Professor McDowell’s “recruit-

99

ing.

Joe ARNOLD, ’37L

 

“Mr. McDowell helped me more
when I was coaching than any other
person I can think of.”

Just how good a football player
was Arnold?

Well, it will be remembered that
the strangest of all football jersey
numerals was once reserved for
Washington and Lee’s backs of out-
standing promise. That jersey was
oo. The first wearer of the double-O
jersey was Joe Arnold, who was the
star of the 1933-34-35 W&L teams,
one of which (1935) won the South-
ern Conference championship.

How did the oo jersey come
about?

“We were in the gym one night,”
Tilson recalled, “ordering uniforms
for the season. Arnold had played
superbly the season before and we
were confident he was going to have
an extra good year. Someone had
the idea that there should be some-
thing distinctive about Joe’s uni-
form, something similar, Say, to
Red Grange’s famous 77 jersey
number. But the double jersey
numbers— 22, 33, and the like—had
become commonplace for outstand-
ing backs. We were stumped until a
fellow—I forget who—came up with
the oo number. An oo numeral
would be distinctive, all right, and
we had it sewn on Arnold’s jersey.

As far as could be ascertained,
only two other Washington and
Lee players wore the oo jersey—
Dick Pinck, perhaps the finest all-
round athletic prospect Washing-
ton and Lee had seen since Cy

The double-o jersey was discard-
ed when Washington and Lee be-

World War II.

Tilson said Arnold’s best game
may have been the one he played
against Princeton in 1934. Prince-
ton in those days was coached by
Fritz Crisler, and ruled the East.
From 1933 through 1935, the ‘Tigers

beaten 1933 Princeton team its
closest game of the season (6-0) and
led the 1934 Tigers until the final
minutes of the game.

With Arnold starring all the
way, the Generals led Princeton
12-7, with time running out. Prince-
ton was forced to punt and Arnold
was playing safety for the Gener-
als. Arnold fumbled the punt as
he was hit by All-American guard
Weller and end Lea. Princeton re-
covered the ball on Washington
and Lee’s 36 and scored in the final
minute to win, 14-12.

Talking about the game and his
fumble, Arnold _ said _ recently,
“Everything I had tried came off
that day, so I never gave a thought
to a fair catch or playing it safe.
The way I was going it might have
been a touchdown.”

SUMMER 1960

should not have affected the out-
come of the game. “We scored an-
other touchdown which was called
back when it should not have been.
We'd put in a play where the full-
back took the snap, charged up to
the line, suddenly stopped, wheel-
ed and pitched back to the half-
back coming around from the wing.
Arnold was the halfback who took
the pitch from the fullback and he
went all the way. But the play
fooled the officials as well as Prince-
ton and we got a penalty instead of
a touchdown.

Double-o Arnold, when a colt,
must have been a right fair run-
ner himself.
