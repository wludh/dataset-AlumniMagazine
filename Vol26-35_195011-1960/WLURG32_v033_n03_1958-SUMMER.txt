the general meeting of the Alumni Association.

OR MANY AN alumnus in the far
EF reaches, the primary contact
with Washington and Lee alter
graduation has been a_ cordial
gentleman named Harry Killinger
Young. For twenty-nine years, he
has been alumni secretary, and as
such, has endeared himself to lit-
erally hundreds of former students
at the Lexington school.

His retirement on June 30, 1958,
ended thirty-three years of illus-
trious service to his alma mater. For
Cy, there never was any job that
could have measured up to the one
he held, because of his everlasting
affection for Washington and Lee.

Ea

A younger Cy in his famous and frenzied “Beat the Wahoos” batile-cry.

He might have made a larger salary
elsewhere, he might have held an
executive position in industry, but
he chose to spend his years at the
University. And—who knows?—he
may have touched more lives as
alumni secretary than he ever could
have as a tycoon of business. Cer-
tainly his influence has been felt
afar, and Washington and Lee has
benefitted exceedingly by his pres-
Clee.

One alumnus wrote President
Francis P. Gaines in 1954, “From
behind the scenes, I have watched
with interest the careers of many
Washington and Lee men, but the

most true-to-life Gentleman from
the University, both in sports and
graduate life, is that man we all
love and admire—the man that im-
pressed me most as a freshman, and
who has done more than most
Washington and Lee men have ever
realized to preserve those traditions
of freedom that we all hold dear—
Cy Young.”

That letter is probably typical
of the feclings of a good many more
alumni, for honors galore have
been heaped upon Cy during the
past year. He has been feted at a
dozen alumni chapter meetings,
and has been presented handsome

Mr. Young has given his Alma Mater the finest quality of service, and
in the largest possible dimension. His devotion and his energy, together
with his warm sympathy, have enabled him to become greatly influential
in building a better Washington and Lee.

‘The love and the prayers of their innumerable friends will always follow

Mr. and Mrs. Young.

gifts. He was elected to Lifetime
Membership by the American
Alumni Council, at its national
meeting at Lake Placid in June. He
was elected to the All-American
basketball team for 1917 by the
Helms Athletic Foundation. And
word comes that Cy is to be named
on the National Footbail Hall of
Fame on a coast-to-coast television
program September 23. On July g,
he was medalist in the Virginia
State Golf Association Seniors
tournament with a three over par
74 at the Homestead course in Hot
Springs.

Cy’s athletic records will stand
for a long time at Washington and
Lee. As a student from 1913 until
1917, he won four letters each in
football, basketball, track, and base-
ball, and he was team captain in
each sport. As a football star, he was
an all-Southern Conference selec-
tion three years and the team’s
leading scorer each season except
his junior year, when a broken col-
larbone sidelined him midway in
the season. He twice won all-South-
ern recognition in basketball, led
the team in scoring, and played
on the only unbeaten Washington
and Lee basketball team, in 1917.
In baseball, Cy was the team’s lead-
ing hitter, scorer and base stealer
for three years. His school track
record of g.8 seconds for the 100-
yard dash has been equalled, but
not broken. And to top it off, he
was popular with students and
faculty alike. He was president of
his senior class and president of
Finals.

SUMMER 1958

While head basketball coach
from 1933 ‘til 1939, his teams won
the Southern Conference cham-
pionship in 1934 and 1937, and
were runnersup in 1935 and 1936.

Cy, a native of Charleston, West

Virginia, was married to Ruth

Neely in 1918. He is the father of
a son, Neely, ’43, and the grand-
father of two left-handed boys who
may yet learn to play golf right-
handed like Cy.

Looking back over his long asso-

clation with the University, Cy
enumerated these events as high-
lights of his career as coach and
alumni secretary:

His first Southern Conference
championship ball team in 1934.

The Generals’ smashing victory
over the University of Virginia in
1951 by a 42-12 margin, the only
loss suffered by the “Wahoos”’ that
season.

And in 1956, the success of the
Alumni Fund when it exceeded the
$100,000 mark for the first time, a
$40,000 increase over contributions
during the previous year.

Cy and Ruth plan to live in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, so Cy can play
golf often—during the intervals he’s
not zipping back up to Lexington
for some event. And with the
Youngs go the best wishes and love
from myriads of friends who will
never forget what Cy has meant to
Washington and Lee.

 

At any Washington and Lee party, Cy was the life of the party. Here he does a fancy

dance step at the reunion jamboree this year, while other guests cheer him on.

Alumni Give Scholarship

Fund in Cy’s Honor

ASHINGTON AND LEE alumni

honored Cy with the establish-
ment of a $15,000 scholarship in
his name, made up of contribu-
tions from hundreds of alumni, and
announced to him at the annual
meeting of the Alumni Association
on June 5.

Stuard A. Wurzburger, °28, of
New York, described the fund, and
served up in traditional “banquet
fare” other gifts for each course of
the meal. The entree was the
scholarship fund. Under its provi-
sions, Cy will receive for the rest
of his life the income from the
endowment fund, and upon his
death, the fund will support a
scholarship for a student whose
qualifications will include ‘“partic-
ular emphasis on athletic ability.”

Among his remarks, Mr. Wurz-
burger said, “If any retirement of
a beloved figure can be called a
happy occasion, I would say that
to date, Cy’s retirement has been
the happiest on record, and what
follows should make it even hap-
pier.... Like the banquet menus
Cy knows so well, we shall serve
these to him course by course, with
this exception. Cy does not have to
eat his banquet, he can take it home
and digest it at his leisure in the
years to come.”

The appetizer was a calling card
for a retired man, reading, “H. K.
Young, Retired, No Business, No
Phone, No Address, No Money.”

The soup course was an album
of messages from alumni of 61 dif-
ferent classes, as far back as 1890.
The bread and butter was a resolu-

4

tion by the Alumni Board of ‘Trus-
tees that Cy be retained as a con-
sultant in alumni affairs for the
university “for as long as his serv-
ices may be available.”

As the chicken, gravy, and trim-
mings, Mr. Wurzburger said, “In
presenting the album to Cy, I
mentioned that messages had come
from friends all over the world.
These friends, and also many

others, wishing to perpetuate Cys
memory in the annals of Washing-
ton and Lee University, also sent
in money, and it gives me both
pleastiie and pride to announce ap-
proxiniately $15,000 has been turn-
ed ocr to the University for the
creation of what will be known as
the H. K. Young scholarship fund.”

James R. Caskie, rector of the
University of the University board
of trustees, gave the ice cream and
cake portion—the details of how
the scholarship will function. He
said he could think of no better
tribute to Cy’s athletic feats than
the scholarship.

In words that came difficult, and
with streaming eyes, Cy declared
his thanks, and said, “I only hope
my grandson can qualify for this
scholarship. ”

 

That warm, wonderful YouNG smile and hearty handshake will not soon be forgotten.

NOTHER SCHOOL YEAR came to a
A close on June 6, as Washing-
ton and Lee graduated 193 men in
exercises held on the lawn in front
of the president’s home. President
Francis P. Gaines awarded degrees,
and made the commencement ad-
dress. He cited the urgent need to
“establish the world spiritually.”

“If we can sacrifice our own
pocketbooks so that other people
may not starve, then we’re on our
way, he declared. “If we sit back
in our selfcenteredness, we are sign-
ing our death warrants.”

Honorary degrees were awarded
to three well-known alumni, and to
a Virginia college president. Doctor
of laws degrees were conferred upon
John... Hellums “Pucker, ‘10, of
Shreveport, Louisiana, founder and
longtime president of the Louisiana
Bar Institute, and an authority on

SUMMER 1958

 

the Napoleonic code; and to Ross
L. Malone, ’32, of Roswell, New
Mexico, president-elect --of the
American Bar Association. “The
doctor of science degree was award-
ed to Dr. Robert Glenn Craig, ’17,
of San Francisco, California, presi-
dent of the American College of
Obstetrics and Gynecology. Dr.
Joseph C. Robert of Hampden-
Sydney College received a doctor
of letters degree, in recognition of
his “vigorous leadership as a young
president of an old college.”

Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, pas-
tor of New York’s Marble Col-
legiate church, and a well-known
author, delivered the Baccalaureate
sermon on ‘Thursday morning,
June 5, in Lee Chapel... Dr. Peale’s
son, John, a philosophy major, was
among the Washington and Lee
graduates this year.

 

The Baccalaureate Processional starts down through the rows of black-gowned seniors to Lee Chapel, as parents and friends watch.

Finals began on Tuesday night,
June 3, with the first of the gradua-
tion dances. On Wednesday, the
trustees met for the end-of-the-year
business, and that night, the Count
Basie orchestra played for the sec-
ond dance, followed by a concert
on the footbridge to Wilson field
‘til the wee small hours. On Thurs-
day, alumni held their general
meeting, at which the retiring
alumni secretary, H. K. Young, was
honored. Other events of the day
included the annual alumni lunch-
eon on the lawn, a meeting of the
alumni board of trustees, and the
annual President’s reception for
seniors and parents that night.

Representatives of the Army,
Navy, and Marine Corps presented
reserve officer commissions to 71
R.O.T.C. seniors Friday morning.
Commencement exercises followed.

The Glasgow visiting professor-
ship will bring to the campus for
one term every other school year a
man or woman “of acknowledged
distinction” in poetry, fiction, dra-
ma, or expository writing. The
donor was a brother of Ellen Glas-
gow, Virginia novelist, and son of
Francis ‘I. Glasgow, an alumnus of
Washington College in 1849.

Miss Porter will teach a course in
creative writing and give occasional
lectures during the spring semester
next year. She has ben writer-in-
residence and lecturer at Stanford
University, the University of Chi-
cago, and other colleges. Among
her chief works are ‘Flowering
Judas,” Hacienda,” “Noon Wine,”
“The Leaning Tower,” “The Days
Before,” and “Pale Horse, Pale
Rider.”

m THE REVEREND Richard L. Gel-
wick, director of religious activities
and chaplain of the university, has
resigned to become director of re-
ligious activities and YMCA sec-
retary at Oberlin College, Oberlin,
Ohio. He joined the Washington
and Lee staff in 1956.

 

‘m DR. ARNOLD J. TOYNBEE, Washing-

ton and Lee’s scholar-in-residence
during last semester, completed his
fifteenth lecture on May 23, and
shortly after, left on the return
trip to his native England.

In a final press conference on
June 2g, Dr. Toynbee declared he
had enjoyed his stay in the United
States and “loved Lexington and
Washington and Lee.’ He _ said
Washington and Lee today is like
Oxford of 1907-11, when he was a
student there. Since then, a social
revolution has taken place in Eng-
land, and today it is not class, but
ability, that gains one entrance to
the better universities, he declared.

The distinguished historian said
he was not able to make a compara-
tive judgment on the scholarship of
American and British students. He
said his only real contact with
American students has been in
“bull sessions,” which he called
“an excellent way to learn,” and
opined that students seem much
interested in world affairs. On the
whole, however, he said, he did not
feel there is enough emphasis

His fifteen lectures were filmed
and taped by Encyclopaedia Britan-
nica Films, Incorporated, along
with some scenes and data on the
college itself, and will be available
to all future Washington and Lee
students.

In a statement of appreciation to
Dr. Toynbee, President Francis P.
Gaines said, “He has enlarged our
vision, deepened our understand-
ing, and stimulated enormously our
thinking.”

 

SALARY 1n-

ms ANOTHER GENERAL
crease for members of the Univer-
sity faculty and staff was approved
by the board of trustees at its June
meeting.

The raise becomes effective Sep-
tember first, and will be five per
cent more than the individual
1957-58 salaries. Special adyjust-
ments in pay for some employees
will be allowed.

 

m A LARGE NUMBER of graduating
students won fellowships and schol-
arships for advanced study, in na-
tionwide competition with other
college students. At least thirteen
outstanding awards were garnered
by Washington and Lee seniors,
among which were: one Fulbright
scholarship for graduate study
abroad; five Woodrow Wilson Na-
tional Fellowships, valued at more
than $1400 each; five Southern Fel-
lowships, valued at $1000 the first
year of graduate study, $15000 the
second year, and $2000 the third
year, in addition to tuition; an
A.E.C. physics fellowship worth
more than $3,500; and a national
award from Delta Upsilon fraterni-
ty for graduate study.

this summer, trying to find out how
the Rocky mountains got there. Dr.
Edgar W. Spencer, ’53, assistant
profesor of geology, plans to spend
the next two summers as. well,
seeking the answer in the Madison
Range of southwest Montana, just
north of Yellowstone National
Park, Wyoming. He has received a
$16,000 grant from the National
Science Foundation to conduct the
research project.

Helping him this summer are
three 1958 graduates, who plan to
continue geologic study in graduate
school next year: Andrew W. Mc-
Thenia, Jr., Alderson West Vir-
ginia; Walter E. Henes, Menomi-
nee, Michigan; and Maynard Blair
Ogden, Jr., Buena Vista, Virginia.

Dr. Spencer has worked five sum-
mers in Montana on similar pro-
jects in the nearby Beartooth
Range. He also worked with the
Lamont Geological Observatory in
oceanographic research and ocean-
floor mapping.

# TWO BRITISH EXCHANGE students,
who spent the past year on the
Washington and Lee campus, think
American students have it too easy,
and that American colleges are not
nearly as demanding upon their stu-
dents as British schools.

Alfred Harrison, 20, of Notting-
ham, England, and Leslie Holyoak,
20, of Hertfordshire, defend their
stand on the fact that they will not
become freshmen in British colleges
until next year. Right out of Eng-
lish secondary schools, they took on
sophomore and junior work at
Washington and Lee, and passed it
with better than Dean’s List aver-
ages.

“American students do not have
to really strive,’ Holyoak pointed
out. “The standard required of a
person to stay in school is not high
enough.”

JAMES W. WHITEHEAD, new Director of
University Relations, will help direct the
two million dollar capital fund cam-
paign for the University. He came to the
University May 1, after serving as execu-
tive director of the Empire State Founda-
tion of Independent Liberal Arts Colleges.

Harrison recommended that at-
tendance at classes be compulsory,
and that students be required to
audit at least two classes, in addi-
tion to the ones they are taking for
credit. He added, “Students here
seem to go to college for a degree,
while British young men go for an
education.”

The two students, who came to
Lexington on special scholarships
offered in conjunction with the
Jamestown 350th Anniversary cele-
bration, praised Washington and
Lee as having an excellent faculty,
“and the facilities, though often
criticized by the students, are quite
adequate.” Holyoak declared,
“American students tend to grum-
ble just for the sake of grumbling,”
pointing out that British students
are too grateful to get in a college
to do much complaining after
they're there. ‘They have been im-
pressed by the generosity of the
American people and the country’s
high standard of living. They both
say the highlight of their year were
the fifteen lectures by British histor-

ian Arnold J. Toynbee, a man
they probably wouldn’t have been
able to hear even in London.

m SOCIAL EXCESSES by _ fraternities
and students brought forth special
action by the faculty in May, and
President Gaines named a commit-
tee to make recommendations on
problems. ‘The faculty reaffirmed
unanimously its regulatory powers
of off-campus activities, after a two-
year experiment with student con-
trols brought complaints of pro-
longed social gatherings, excessive
noise, and conduct in bad taste,
especially on Sundays. Dr. Gaines
said he planned to write to all par-
ents of students about the problem.

Sixty-two cadets in Washington
and Lee’s R.O.T.C. groups received
the gold bars of second lieutenants

back to the campus for Finals a
large number of alumni, many of
whom had come especially to say
good-bye to retiring alumni secre-
tary H. K. Young, °17.

At the general meeting of the
Alumni Association, most of the
time was spent in eulogizing “Cy,”
and in presenting him with several
gifts, including the lifetime income
from a $15,000 fund contributed
by alumni for a scholarship in his
honor.

However, the association did take
time out for several elections. For
three-year terms on the Alumni
Board of Trustees, the group chose
Clark B. Winter, ’37, New York
City; Bernard Levin, ’42, Norfolk,
Virginia; and Paul M. Shuford, ’43,
Richmond, Virginia. For two-year
terms on the University Commit-
tee on Intercollegiate Athletics, the
group elected Preston Brown, °42,
of Lexington, Virginia; and John
L. Crist, Jr. °45, of Charlotte,
North Carolina.

The Alumni Board of ‘Trustees
chose David D. Johnson, ‘21, of
Bridgeport, West Virginia, as pres-
ident for the coming year; Frank C.
Brooks, ’46, Baltimore, Maryland,
vice-president; and Ben Ditto, ’42,
of Houston, ‘Texas, as treasurer.

Mr. Johnson was vice-president the

m ATHLETIC NEWS BROKE fast at the
end of the school year and during
the early summer. Washington and
Lee came up with a series of honors
in lacrosse; the school lost its
basketball coach, appointed an-
other, then lost him, too. But the
event of greatest importance was
the announcement by the univer-
sity on June 13 that it was with-
drawing from the Southern Con-
ference, effective July 1.

Washington and Lee helped
organize the conference back in
1922, and the decision to leave the
fold seemed to many persons un-
fortunate if only for sentimental
reasons. But the University Com-
mittee on Intercollegiate Athletics
in its letter of recommendation to
the Board of ‘Trustees listed a num-
ber of compelling reasons why
Washington and Lee should drop
out. Among them were these:

The rule adopted by the confer-
ence this year which makes fresh-
men eligible for varsity competi-
tion “more than offsets the advant-
ages of conference membership”
for Washington and Lee. The uni-
versity needs freshmen for its var-
sity teams, and the committee reas-
oned that no student should be
denied the opportunity to compete
in intercollegiate sports, no matter
what his class might be.

As an independent, Washington
and Lee “should be in a better po-
sition to promote a new and more
homogeneous alignment if and
when such an opportunity presents
itself.” This means Washington and
Lee may find it advantageous to
join another conference in the fu-
ture, one composed of schools of
similar athletic purpose. But, it was
pointed out in the announcement
to the press, no such alignment is
under consideration at the present
or seems likely in the near future.

trustees, but a valid reason none-
theless, was one expressed by Dr.
William Hinton, chairman of the
athletic committee. He pointed out
that all other schools in the South-
ern Conference except Washing-
ton and Lee engage in athletic sub-
sidization, making the university
something of an outsider although
a member. “We were operating at
two different levels,’ he said.

In President Gaines’ letter to
conference officials, notifying them
ofhcially of the withdrawal, he said:
“The entire university family re-
grets the necessity for this step. We
have enjoyed through long years
our association with sister colleges
in this conference, and for each
one of them we have high respect.
It has seemed to our authorities,
however, that under our athletic
policy the conference membership
does not help us achieve the pur-
pose.”

SUMMER 1958

In the matter of coaches, Louis F.
“Weenie” Miller resigned as basket-
ball coach to move next door to
Virginia Military Institute in the
same job. In his one year with the
Generals, his basketball team had
a g-16 record and his baseball team
finished 5-9. At VMI, he steps into
a basketball revitalization program
under which a number of athletic
grants-in-aid will be at his disposal.

Named to succeed him in basket-
ball at Washington and Lee was
Gene Corrigan, the popular lacrosse
and soccer coach of the past three
years. But Corrigan’s tenure lasted
little more than a month, for in
July he resigned to accept the job
of head lacrosse coach and assistant
basketball coach at the University
of Virginia.

The Alumni Secretary Tells of

A Quarter Century

in Review

By Harry K. YOUNG, ‘17

N THIS, MY FINAL REPORT aS S€C-
I tary of the Alumni Association,
I should like to review briefly a few
of our major accomplishments of
the last quarter-century. The origi-
~nal purpose of our Alumni Society
was stated as “the promotion of
mutual good feeling among the
alumni, the election of alumni trus-
tees, and the advancement of the
interest of Washington and Lee
University.” I believe we have
gone along with that directive. Cer-
tainly alumni interest in Univer-
sity affairs has notably increased
over the year. This interest shows
itself in the contributions to the
Alumni Fund, attendance at Re-
unions, visits to the campus, letters
to administrative officers and facul-
ty (often with constructive sugges-
tions), and meetings of alumni
groups.

Alumni Chapters

The past year has been a most ac-
tive one, and especially does this
apply to meetings of our local alum-
ni chapters. These groups showed
me many courtesies on this my “last
round-up”; I personally visited
twelve during the year. In my first
year as your secretary there were
seven active alumni chapters
throughout the today
there are thirty-seven.

From the June, 1840, minutes
of an Alumni Association meeting
we learn that alumni clubs are to
be organized as follows: “Where-

country;

12

ever there are five or more alumni
residing in the same city or neigh-
borhood, these shall meet and or-
ganize an Alumni Club of Wash-
ington College. ‘These Clubs shall
hold semi-annual meetings, one in
the spring and one in the autumn,
where around the festive board they
may throw off for a time the cares
and toils of active business, and re-
call the bright days and joyous in-
cidents of college life.” So it appears
that times actually change very lht-
tle and yet the alumni chapters of
today seem charged with a far great-
er seriousness of purpose. They have
assumed a vital role in the develop-
ment of our University; they are
particularly helpful in their ap-
praisal of boys who make applica-
tion to Washington and Lee.

The Fund

I am sorry I cannot tell you that
our Alumni Fund is having its
best year. Perhaps we can credit to
the recession the fact that, dollar-
wise, we are dragging a little at this
point. As of today, the record stands
at $90,101.31 received from 2,924
contributors. On the same day last
year we had received $94,209 from
2,978 contributors. I am hopeful
the 25 days yet remaining until we
close our books will remedy this
situation. The first year of our
Fund, 1933, we received a total of
$3,700 from 506 alumni. By 1946
we had brought this up to $23,000
and, a quarter of a century since

the beginning, we have arrived at a
goal of $100,000.

In all, 7,072 alumni have con-
tributed at one time or another to
the Fund.

Reunions

As for other phases of your Asso-
clation’s activities during the 1957-
58 year, I comment on just two.
This group will remember how we
have tried through the years to
establish some sort of definite and
compelling Class Reunion program.
It is finally gaining form. In May
we had our fourth Annual Reunion
of the 25, 40, and 50-year Classes.
The number of alumni in attend-
ance broke all previous records.
Plans are already in the making
for a Reunion of all classes in
June, 1959. This will follow the
pattern of our successful Bicen-
tennial Reunion in 1949, repeated
in 1954, which was voted to become
a five-year occasion.

The Magazine

Following the trend in alumni
publications across the country, we
are trying faithfully to bring our
Alumni more information, through
The Alumni Magazine, about our
present-day University and higher
education in general. By now we
are all aware of the crisis in educa-
tion. Our Winter magazine fea-
tured a lead article on science edu-
cation at Washington and Lee; our
Spring issue, as you doubtless re-
call, is devoted largely to an ar-
ticle entitled, “American Higher
Education in 1958.”

We feel that we are publishing
an improved magazine, and we like
to credit much of this “new look”
to our able managing editor, Mrs.
Robert Jeffrey.

Of course I cannot close a report
for the year without commenting
on the improved administrative fa-
cilities in the Alumni Office. Our

so-called ‘““machine room,” contain-

ency and comfort of us all.

* * *

And now to grow personal for
a moment. The years go fast at
Washington and Lee. It hardly
seems possible that it is now more
than forty-four years, almost half
a century, since I first came to Lex-
ington as a freshman, wearing a
derby hat and a Norfolk jacket. (By
the way, I soon learned that those
two accessories of my very modest
wardrobe were not conventional
dress!) Forty-four years is a long
period in the life of any individual
and, with the exception of short
tours in World Wars I and II and
a brief career in the business world,
I have spent most of that time on
the campus of Washington and Lee.

But there comes a time in every
man’s life when he must consult
the calendar, and that time has ar-
rived for me. As you know, I am
convinced it is time for me to step
down.

I am full of gratitude for all the
help I have received during my

SUMMER 1958

long term of office. I want to thank
the University’s administrative of-
ficers for their wonderful coopera-
tion: Dr. Gaines, Dean Gilliam,
Dean Sensabaugh, Mr. Mattingly,
Dean Williams, Dean Adams, and
Dr. Leyburn. I am under eternal
obligation to the members of the
Faculty-Aumni Committee, the
Aumni Board of ‘Trustees, the
Alumni Fund Council, the Class
Agents, the Regional Agents, and
the local chapter officers. (I am
reminded that since 1933, our first
Fund year, over 800 alumni have
served as Class and _ Regional
Agents). In short, I thank each
and every alumnus for tireless ef-
fort, for generous cooperation, and
for devoted loyalty.

* * *

It has been my privilege to serve
you during a period of the Univer-
sity's greatest development. I be-
lieve I can say our Alumni Asso-
ciation is healthier and stronger in
every way than at any time in its
history. To William Washburn,
who now assumes this office of
Alumni Secretary, I express my con-
gratulations and best wishes. I am
sure he will find in this position
the same satisfaction that comes to
everyone who gives his best ef-

forts to Washington and Lee, for I,
myself, can think of nothing finer
than a life-time association with our
school. We may change our resi-
dence, our church, and our clubs.
But nothing will ever change our
status as alumni of Washington and
Lee.

As for my office staff, and there
have been many members on it over
the long years, I can say only that
I feel they are actually a part of
my family. I appreciate their en-
thusiasm and their loyalty and
their help more than I can ever
let them know.. In particular, I
shall always be grateful for the de-
voted service of Miss Mary Barclay,
Mrs. Harold Lauck and Dr. Gaines’
secretary, Miss Albertina Raven-
horst, a former member of our staff.

* * *

In closing, may I add, I am con-
scious that I have made mistakes
along the way but I hope not many
major ones. I have spared no effort,
considered no personal gain or
comfort in the performance of my
duties as I saw them. It is a period
of my life, extended both in time
and labor, that in retrospect will
always be warming and _ thrilling
and mostly because you have helped
make it so.

The Alumni Association President Gives

A Tribute to the ‘‘Best Alumnus’”’

By Ernest Woopwakrb, II, "40

Y NEXT OFFICIAL duty, as your
President, is to recognize the
retiring Secretary. This is Cy’s last
alumni meeting as your secretary,
and despite the fact that Cy knows
how we feel about him, somebody
has to say it officially.

When I realized that this was in-
cluded in my job, my first thought
was that it wasn’t really fair to Cy.
I thought of the great athletes that
he had coached, of his teammates.
When we think of Cy we immedi-
ately call to mind his 16 varsity let-
ters, his captaincy of all four major
sports, the All-American recogni-
tion that has finally come to him.
We then think of his long years of
turning out outstanding teams and
outstanding athletes.

And yet, as I thought of it, it
seemed perhaps even more appro-
priate for some one like myself to
salute Cy. For we are not now
paying tribute to Cy Young, the
athlete. We appreciate his contri-
bution to W&L as a player, and
later as a coach, of course. But that
we appreciate (although perhaps in
a greater degree) as we do other
players and other coaches. ‘They
come, they play, we cheer, and their
records are neatly put away in the
record books.

So it’s singularly appropriate for
somebody like myself to pay tribute
to Cy: representing as I do the great
bulk of alumni who never made a
letter, who were never outstanding
scholars, who never made any sig-
nificant contributions to Washing-
ton and Lee.

14

But I have one qualification for
this job: I love Washington and
Lee very much. And that’s all Cy
has ever asked. Any person who
loves W&L, who will serve her even
a little, and (if you will) help sup-
port her, can have all of Cy’s time,
energy, and a real friendship. ‘The
lesson I at least have learned from
Cy is that W&L is more than ban-
ners and goal posts, more than
books and laboratories, more even
than students and faculty and alum-
ni: it is Washington and Lee. It’s
a unity: not a lot of little parts.

Last fall, on a cold rainy day, |
went into the Alumni Office to see
Cy. He wasn’t in.

I have received letters by the
dozens and talked with hundreds
of alumni about the University’s
athletic policy. If any man had a
legitimate right to complain, and
experience upon which to base a
complaint, it’s the greatest athlete
the school ever produced, as well as
its finest coach. But where was Cy
on that cold, dreary November
day? He was watching football
practice.

The team wasn’t very good, as
measured by Cy’s All-American
standards, and they didn’t have a
very good record: but they were
the Washington and Lee Generals,
and that was enough for Cy.

But I’m getting off into athletics
again. Cy is enthusiastic about any-
thing that is connected with W&L,
whether it’s debating, art, journal-
ism, or just someone that loves the
University.

Many people do not imagine the
tremendous work load this has put
on Cy nor how many fields it em-
braces. For example, it was Cy who
saw the need for a Director of De-
velopment. It was primarily he who
was able to procure Don Smith for
that job. You may not realize that
Don was then brought in—a non-
alumnus, at considerably more
compensation than Cy was getting.
You would imagine a conflict de-
veloping between the two. But
when Don had to leave to take a
much finer situation, it was his
keen friendship with Cy Young that
made him reluctant to leave. ‘here
could never have been any conflict
between Cy and anyone who would
help W&L—in any respect.

In my three years as a [rustee,
working closely with Cy, I have
been greatly impressed with his
ability and efficiency. Few people
really understand the tremendous
job of running that “business.” For
example, the Alumni Fund collects
over $100,000 a year. The Office
maintains over 13,000  files—and
maintains them, too. In addition
to traveling the banquet circuit,
and other day-by-day routines, there
are such things as Homecomings,
the class reunions, the Board of
Trustees meeting, the alumni
luncheons, smokers, and this an-
nual meeting. In all of these years,
Cy has been “open for business,” 24
hours a day. And, as Cy and all of
us know, he’s been able to do it
only because Ruth also has been a
true and devoted friend of W&L,
putting its welfare above her own.
We'll all miss her, too.

We salute Cy Young, then, not
because of his 16 letters, or his fine
teams he has coached, or even his
wonderful shining years as Alum-
ni Secretary. We do pay tribute and
respect to just about the best
alumnus that Washington and Lee
could ever hope to have:

Cy Young Commended
By Sports Columnist

“In the Katzenjammerish world
of sports, wherein we work, one
counts his blessings rather than the
passing years,” wrote Chauncey
Durden, sports editor of the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch recently. “So,
it always comes as something of a
shock when old. friends, whom
you'd never thought of as being
subject to ‘Time’s relentless pres-
sure and wear, reach the age of re-
tirement.

alumni heaped their praise and
largess on W&L’s retiring alumni
secretary, Harry K. “Cy” Young.
A Cy Young Scholarship was es-
tablished.... During his lifetime,
Young will receive the income from
the endowment fund. Upon his
death—and The Dark Angel won’t
even be checking Cy as a possibility
for many years to come—the fund
will support a scholarship for a
student whose qualifications will in-
clude ‘particular emphasis on ath-
letic ability.’

“... We've heard that
will become a Floridian, and play
golf 12 months a year, but Cy could
no more stay away from Lexington
and W&L for any length of time
than he could pass up a good cut-
ting up of memories with old
friends. Why—who  knows?—the
time may come again when Cy will
deliver his famed ‘Beat the Wa-
hoos’ oration to a frenzied W&L
student body the night before a
Virginia-W&L game.

“... Young, the greatest athlete
in W&L’s history, still retains much
of the athlete’s appearance. Full of
nervous energy, he can still beat

a conservative undergraduate, and
‘does things’ for a tweed sports
jacket and a pair of grey flannel
slacks....We once heard Cap’n

Dick Smith, W&L’s retired athletic
director, say that Young was the
finest college athlete he’d seen, and
by far the ‘most debonair’ athlete
he recalled. Cy remains the debon-
air man.

“... Young professed a_ great
hatred for the University, or ‘Wa-
hooland,’ as he called it. ‘I always
pull the shades down on the train
when I go through Charlottesville,’
Cy bragged, ‘and until they built
that Route 259 bypass round Char-
lottesville, I drove from Lexington

 

Trustee PAUL M. SHUFORD, ’43

to Richmond on Route 60 to avoid
Wahooland.’

“Yet on the night of May 24,
1955, Young was the speaker at Vir-
ginia’s annual sports award ban-
quet.... Dick ‘Turner says Cy
brought a couple of old_ pistols
with him and, upon being intro-
duced as speaker of the evening,
carefully placed the pistols on the
table in front of him. He closed his
speech with excerpts from his ‘Beat
the Wahoos’ exhortation. Turner
says the Wahoos loved it.”

The twenty-five year men wait at their registration table to nab other members of the
class of 1933. Left to right, they are Dick EDWARDS, GEORGE JOSEPH, JACK CROWL, BERNARD
“Dusty” Davis, JOHN Ericson, and BILL STONE. They found there were 122 present.

T WAS ALL ouT for a good time

on the weekend of May 9-10,
when 175 alumni and wives de-
scended upon Lexington for the
reunions of law and_ academic
classes of 1908, 1918, and 1933.

Of the three classes, the men of
1g08 made the most impressive at-
tendance record. Out of 58 living
members, twenty-one attended the
reunion, some from as far away as
California and New Mexico. Six-
teen wives attended. ‘There were
sixteen alumni and wives of the
class of 1918, with youngsters of
1933 making up the rest of the
group.

Headquarters for the fiftieth,
fortieth, and twenty-fifth reunion
celebrants were both the Robert E.
Lee and Mayflower Hotels.

In addition to renewing old acquaintances, checking
hairlines, waistlines, and number of children and grand-
children, the returnees got a comprehensive apprasial
of the “state of the university” from administration,
faculty, and student spokesmen. University Dean L. F.
Sensabaugh, law school Dean Clayton E. Williams, com-
merce school Dean Lewis W. Adams, Dean of Students
Frank J. Gilliam, and student body president J. Arnold
Groobey were among the speakers. These sessions
prompted much inquiry and discussion, and demon-
strated the avid interest of the alumni present.

Individual class banquets were held, and among the
scheduled entertainment was music by the college vocal
eroup, the Sazeracs. They sang college songs, and as a
special feature, included popular tunes of the years 1908,
ig18, and 1933. A jamboree for the combined classes
followed the banquet. Wives went on a tour of Lex-
ington gardens, as alumni visited with former professors.

One of the highlights of the reunion weekend was a
lecture by Dr. Arnold J. Toynbee, visiting scholar in
residence at Washington and Lee, who spoke in Lee
Chapel on “The Rise of Technology and the Flight
from the Land Into the Cities.”

Following Dr. Toynbee’s address, reunion classes
were entertained at a university reception . Dr. Gaines
addressed the final luncheon meeting on Saturday.

Washington and Lee and
Student Life in the 18g0’s

By “TRUMAN S. VANCE, ‘99

I ENTERED Washington and Lee
in September, 1895. My coming
was partly because of what we may
call an ancestral accident, for my
ereat-grandfather had come _ to
Liberty Hall Academy 103 years
earlier. My oldest brother went to
the University of Virginia for Aca-
dem and Law, but the others of us
were sent to Washington and Lee.
Father almost worshipped General
Lee and Stonewall Jackson. He felt
that boys breathing the atmosphere
of such a shrine would be the bet-
ter for such hallowed surroundings
during their formative college days.
I think he was right.

I boarded with my younger
brother and a ‘Texas boy at Prof.
Humphreys’, then head of the en-
gineering department. Our board
and room was $20 per month. I
came on a Charleston, West Vir-
ginia, Alumni Scholarship, and my
total of other expenses for the year
were $285. Others lived even cheap-
er. At Old Blue, a tavern with
nearly a hundred years even then to
its credit, board and room was $13,
and even cheaper, if four were in
a room.

We had athletics, too, sixty-odd
years ago. We always knew when
the ball season was almost upon us
by some good sports that came
around with papers begging, im-
ploring, even coercing us to sub-
scribe $1.50, if financially able, to
buy baseball or football uniforms,
a bat or two, and some balls. They
had no helmets, a shock of hair and
a tough skull being the only brain
protection against the shock of
head-on collision. A nose protector

18

of rubber, the upper end held by a
strap around the head and the low-
er held firm in the teeth, helped the
player to save his good looks. As
well as I remember, I was able to
give only 50 cents one season, but
IT made it up on the ballfield and
eridiron.

We had a gymnasium, too. It
was down in an unsavory part of
the campus. It was in Egypt, the
name derived from the fact that the
Nile was just at the bottom of the
bluff whereon were perched the
toilets of Washington College days.
‘The gym was a little frame build-
ing big enough for some 15 or 20
of us to trot around in a circle with
Harry Pratt as ringmaster, yelling

‘TRUMAN VANCE, ’99

 

corrections of our carriage and
pace.

Our physical equipment was not
so good by present-day standards,
but in faculty and the excellent
courses they taught, I'll set them
against the world of instructors for
getting math and languages and
literature through some pretty thick
adolescent skulls. We had only
about 225 students in Academ and
Law, classes were small, and_ pro-
fessors took a deep interest in us
all.

Every year since the college has
had boat crews, it has been the am-
bition of each to make the statue
of George Washington wear its
colors, red for the Harry Lees and
blue for the Albert Sidney crew—
and still another coat of white by
the colege authorities to restore
the Father of His Country to his
pristine appearance. I never took
part in but one of these paintings,
but somehow the Albert Sidneys
got wind of the Harry Lees’ inten-
tions and had barricaded them-
selves in the third story of the
building, and with lumps of an-
thracite coal then burned in the
classrooms, gave us quite a fight
before we ousted them, Then two
young daredevils scrambled to the
roof and cupola to give Father
George the works. College legend
says that when the noble image was
at last scraped, 83 successive layers
of red, white, and blue were re-
moved.

To me, Lexington of that day
was socially delightful. And gal-
lant, too. Whenever a lady, be she
16 or 60, entered the room, each
man was expected to rise and stand
beside his seat, as though hoping
the fair female would honor him
by accepting his chair. And smok-
ing in the presence of a lady, even
on the street, was an act so rude
that it was not even entered in the
unwritten rules of that day. Cig-
arettes, smoked by only a few, were
considered too effeminate for a real
grownup man. A pipe was the

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

proper thing, and the stronger it
was, the more manly its use.

Although there were only 225
students in all, there were still not
enough girls to go around, and
popular girls especially had a
grand rush. At homes where Sun-
day calls were permitted, the com-
petition was really intense. ‘To pre-
vent crowding, there was a rule
that when new callers came, those
present left. “This was known as
“chasing,” and added much to the
zest of all. Often we would see some
callers enter a house only a few
minutes before ten o’clock, the cur-
few hour, and just a minute before
the town clock struck the hour, we
would march in to chase the luck-
less callers away. This entitled us
to stay, uninterrupted, until halt
past ten, or even at some homes,
‘ul eleven.

At one home with three girls,
there were no Sunday calls allowed,
but we could take the girls to
church. Miss Janet, especially, was
dated ahead for months for her
Sunday night church-going. Mine,
made in October, came due one
lovely moonlight night in April.
Her home was only three blocks
from the church, but by hurrying,
we made it in fifteen minutes.
Coming home, her pace was so very
slow that I could not weigh the
time of each step. I asked, “Don't
you think we could walk around
the block, and go a little faster?”
“Oh, no,” she rephed, “Mother
says that we must come straight
home.”

Strangely enough, it would seem
to you younger men, I do not sad-
den at the thought that, of all the
boys and girls of that happy period,
not a dozen are alive today. I
think happily of the good times
we had together, and look forward
to reminiscing with them again,
with plenty of time to recall many
pleasant hours of our college days
together. May none of them be
missing among the myriads of the
saved, is my final wish and prayer!

ington University and American
University, was named to coach
baseball and soccer, but the la-
crosse and basketball jobs remained
unfilled as this issue went to press.

Although the lacrosse team’s
1958 record was a seemingly un-
impressive 5-6, the season was a
successful one. Captain Jim Lewis,
the General’s veteran goalie, cli-
maxed four years of varsity play by
being named to the first team All-
American squad selected by the
United States Lacrosse Coaches’ As-
sociation. Four other Generals—
midfielders Henry LeBrun and Bill
Caspari and attackmen Dave Nich-
ols and Ned Pendleton—were hon-
orable mention All-American selec-
tions.

Lewis also was honored by the
nine college lacrosse coaches in
Maryland who unanimously voted
him the outstanding goalie to play
on Maryland soil during the 1958
season. He received the Kelly Me-
morial ‘Trophy, symbolic of the
honor, at halftime ceremonies of
the Johns-Hopkins-Mt. Washing-
ton game in Baltimore.

He and LeBrun were named to
the allstar team of the Laurie Cox
“B” Division in college lacrosse.
Lewis became Washington and
Lee’s second first team AH-Ameri-
can. Another goalie, Bill Clements,
won the honor—and the Kelley
trophy in 1950.

The Generals played the tough-

est schedule of any team in the
country. They dropped 9-4 and 14-
11 decisions to Maryland and Johns
Hopkins, and were edged by Mt.
Washington, 8-7, all three teams
among the top four in the nation.
The Generals climaxed the season
by defeating Virginia, 12-5, to end
a 10-year victory drought with the
Cavaliers.

In baseball, the Generals had
rough going most of the way, but
with freshman righthander Roy
Carpenter winning four games,
they managed to finish strong with
victories over Richmond and Vir-
ginia for a season mark of 5-9.

The track team won four, lost
three, and Skip Rohnke, ace jave-
lin man, won the Big Six title. The
tennis squad had a fine year, win-
ning six, losing three and _finish-
ing third in the conference tourna-
ment. The golfers also had a fine
dual match record of 7-3, but they
fared poorly in tournament com-
petition.

More honors continued to come
to Dom Flora, the most prolific
basketball scorer ever to play at
Washington and Lee. He_ was
named to the Helms Athletic
Foundation first team All-American
squad, and he was selected both
basketball player of the year and
athlete of the year by the Southern
Conference Sportswriters Associa-
tion.

Many folks felt if Washington
and Lee had to leave the confer-
ence, it was nice to bow out with
one of the Generals’ finest players
ranked as best in the league.

Fred Vinson, Jr., ’48, spoke of Cy’s
outstanding service in twenty-nine
years of alumni work at Washing-
ton and Lee. He also described Cy’s
wonderful athletic record, climaxed
by his unequalled feat of captain-

Mr. Young told the group that
“it has been my privilege to serve
you in a time that I think to be
a period of the University’s great-
est transition. It has been heart-
warming to have been associated
with the tireless efforts of hundreds
of alumni who have worked dili-
gently and unselfishly so that Wash-
ington and Lee will be prepared
physically and academically to meet
her fair share of the national prob-
lem of higher education. This is
a goal that I am sure we will want
to achieve, not just because of our

pride in the University, but be-
cause we want to provide these fa-
cilities for future generations.”

Introduced were William C.
