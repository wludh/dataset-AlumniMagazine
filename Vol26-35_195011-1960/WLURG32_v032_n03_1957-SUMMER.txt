Honorary degrees ere awarded here in June to two prominent Washington and Lee alum-

ni. They are, left, MELVIN IRVINE DUNN, JR. ’23, vice-president in charge of operations of

the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, of Cleveland, Ohio, who was awarded the honorary

degree of doctor of science. DR. ARCHIBALD BOLLING SHEPPERSON, ’1 8, right, chairman of the

English department, University of Virginia, and editor of The Virginia Review, was
awarded the degree of doctor of letters.

OMMENCEMENT UNDER the trees

was again the order of the day
for 189 Washington and Lee sen-
lors, as the g08th academic year
came to a close on June 7 in cere-
monies on the front campus lawn.
President Francis P. Gaines award-
ed degrees and delivered the grad-
uation address, urging the seniors

2

to have faith in their country in
“this pessimistic age.” “There will
be questions in your lives to which
there are no answers,” he warned,
but he asked them to build upon a
faith which is undiluted.

‘T’'wo honorary degrees were con-
ferred, upon M. I. Dunn, ’23, and
Dr. Archibald B. Shepperson, ’18. A

third degree was announced, but
not conferred. ‘The doctor of divin-
ity degree will be awarded to Dr.
Theodore F. Adams, pastor of the
First Baptist Church of Richmond,
when his health permits his at-
tendance.

Candidates for the Bachelor of
Science degree were presented by
Dean Leon F. Sensabaugh. Dean
Lewis W. Adams of the School of
Commerce and Administration
presented the candidates for the
Bachelor of Science in Commerce,
and Dean Clayton E. Williams of
the School of Law presented candi-
dates for the Bachelor of Laws.

The valedictory address was de-
livered by Charles M. Drum of
Richmond.

The baccalaureate service was
held the day before commencement,
the speaker being Dr. Clarence W.
Cranford, pastor of Calvary Baptist
Church of Washington, D.C. For
him, it was a repeat performance at
Washington and Lee, as he was bac-
calaureate speaker in 1942.

Other events during the three-
day finals were: the trustees’ meet-
ing on June 5; two dances, with
music by the Richard Maltby or-
chestra; the Alumni Association
meeting and luncheon; Alumni As-
sociation Trustees meeting; a re-
ception for seniors, parents, and
guests at the home of Dr. and Mrs.
Gaines; a commissioning ceremony
for ROTC graduates; and a fare-
well concert on the footbridge to
Wilson Field at 1:15 a.m. for hardy
students and dates who had already
danced from g until 1.

One of the most exciting, al-
though unplanned events during
graduation occurred on June 5,
when a twin-engined DC-3 trans-
port, seeking to land at Lexington
International Airport to pick up
Christopher T. Chenery, ’og, skidd-
ed on the long, wet grass of the field,
went through a fence, and ended
across the highway, with its nose
in a mudbank. Mr. Chenery, who
had been attending the University

Board of ‘Trustees’ meeting, left
Lexington via other transportation,
and the plane underwent thou-
sands of dollars worth of repairs the
following week, including the re-
placement of both engines. Visitors,
here to see the sights of Lexington
during finals, duly included a visit
to view the damaged plane, and a
town policeman was sent out to
maintain order.

 

m AT ITS JUNE MEETING, the Board of
Trustees gave tentative approval for
a capital fund campaign which
would provide resources to meet
major needs of the University’s
physical plant including new sci-
ence, journalism, and gymnasium
facilities.

The proposed campaign is ex-
pected to get underway some time
in 1958, Dr. Francis P. Gaines said.

 

Initial studies and surveys will be
made in the fall, including an ap-
praisal of the University’s fund-
raising capacity by a_ professional
consulting organization.

Other action by the board in-
cluded a five percent general salary
increase for all full-time faculty
members and employees, effective
September 1.

Also approved was a report by a
special faculty study committee
which recommended that the ulti-
mate size of Washington and Lee’s
student body be 1,150 undergradu-
ates, plus 100 to 150 law students.
This figure, representing an = in-
crease of 22 percent over the current
enrollment level, will be attained
in 1970-71, by increasing the fresh-
man class by five or six students
each year. Board approval of the
recommendation was made condi-
tional to frequent reappraisal of
the matter by its members.

The trustees also established the
Douglas Southall Freeman _profes-

sorship in American History. ‘The
new chair will honor the late Pulit-
zer prize-winning author and editor
for his “excellence as biographer of
General Lee,” and also in recogni-
tion of the fact that the University
received for its library Dr. Free-
man’s personal collection of books
and pamphlets relating to Lee and
the Civil War.

The board also approved final
plans for the dining hall-dormitory
building. (See page 11).

 

m@ FACULTY APPOINTMENTS eflective
on September 1 include Lewis S.
Minter, assistant professor in the
law school; John M. Gunn, Jr., as-
sistant professor of economics; Ed-
gar Winston Spencer, assistant pro-
fessor of geology; and Marion J].
Blanchard, instructor in mathema-
tics.

Good food, good conversation, and reunions with old friends characterized the luncheon given by the Alumni Association on June 6. Al-
though the event was scheduled for outdoors, threatening skies forced the diners into Doremus gymnasium, where informality pre:
vailed. Above are some of the alumni, wives, children, faculty, and staff who participated in this annual event.

made in July 1956, and included
an accomplishment grant of $105,-
ooo. This makes a total of $621,500
from the Foundation.

Sixteen other Virginia colleges
received checks from the Founda-
tion, and five got accomphshment
grants, in addition to the specified
funds. ‘These grants were made to
institutions which emphasized lib-
eral arts and sciences, and had dem-
onstrated leadership in improving
faculty status and compensation.
The other four schools winning
these boosts were: Hollins College,
University of Richmond, Ran-
dolph - Macon Woman's College,
and Sweet Briar.

The Board of Trustees at Wash-
ington and Lee voted to use the
entire sum from the grants for in-
creasing faculty salaries, and an-
other approximate five per cent

boost in pay scales goes into effect
September 1.

m FORTY PER CENT OF THE parents of
Washington and Lee students in
the last session were contributors to
the 1956-57 Parents’ Fund. ‘There
were 487 contributors for a total
of $46,857.30, a record to be proud
of. ‘The campaign closed June 30,
1957-

M. M. Caskie, Jr., of Arlington,
Virginia, will head the Parents’ Ad-
visory Council next year. He suc-
ceeds John E. Larson of Washing-
ton, D.C., who served as co-chair-
man in 1955-56 and chairman in

May are: vice-chairman, W. K.
Allen Ferguson of Louisville, Ken-
tucky; and chairman of the Parents’
Fund committee, W. T. Dixon
Gibbs of Baltimore, Maryland.

‘The Parents’ Council, now in its
third year, is designed to promote
good relationships between the uni-

5

versity and the students’ parents.
It was organized by the University
Development Office.

Last year, 329 parents gave $27,-
168 in unrestricted funds for use
in improving the school.

m AN UNUSUAL GIFT of $1,200 was re-
ceived by Washington and Lee re-
cently. It came from the First Na-
tional City Bank of New York, as
its portion in a program of financial
aid to highter education.

The grant was made on_ the
basis of the number of graduates of
the college who have been employ-
ed by the bank for five years or
more, or who have become oflicers of
the bank. Washington and Lee was
one of 109 colleges and universities
sharing in the bank’s program.

‘The three Washington and Lee
men with the bank are: W. Joe Pat-
ton, ‘22; F. I. Mitchell, 25; and
Riley P. Stevenson, ’29.

The bank intends to repeat this
grant to Washington and Lee each
year that the employees remain in
the active service of the bank.

A FUND FOR ASSISTANCE to deserv-
ing students in journalism and com-
munications has been established
here through a gift of $1,500 from
an anonymous alumnus.

President Francis P. Gaines said
the gift would be known as the “Di-
rector’s Fund,” and will be admin-
istered at the discretion of Profes-

sor O. W. Riegel, director of the

university's Lee Memorial Journal-

ism Foundation. ‘The donor indi-
cated that he would make addt1-
tional contributions yearly of ap-
proximately the same amount.
Either interest or principal will be
used for student help, according to
the donor’s specifications.

 

THE INTERFRATERNITY
will provide scholarship assistance
to a Hungarian refugee student who
will study at the university during
the 1957-58 term.

The student is Thomas Mandey,
who studied English last semester
at St. Michael’s in Vermont. He
formerly attended university-level
classes in science, German, and Rus-
sian in Budapest.

Arrangements for bringing Man-
dey to Washington and Lee were
handled through the World Uni-
versity Service in New York City.
Mandey has been in the United
States since January 11. ‘The Hun-
garian student plans to study radio

Arranged through the auspices
of the English-Speaking Union's
Education Committee, the scholar-
ships have been accepted by Alfred
Harrison, of Nottingham, and
Leslie T. F. Holyoak, of Herford-
shire.

Both are outstanding young

Nottingham Bluecoat School and
earned a_ state scholarship to
Christ’s College, Cambridge. Holy-
oak, also 19, attended Ayr Acad-
emy and Berkhamsted School and
later studied in Germany.

Harrison plans to study econom-
ics and related subjects while at
Washington and Lee. Holyoak
hopes to take courses in French and
German literature and in music.

Prof. Rupert N. Latture, faculty
advisor to foreign students, said the
scholarship grants will include
full-time tuition and fees, and the
Interfraternity Council will pro-
vide arrangements for meals and
lodging.

The British students will cover
their own transportation costs to
and from England and will provide
for other incidental expenses.

m FOUR WASHINGTON AND LEE Uni-
versity men have been awarded
coveted fellowships for graduate
study this year.

Wilson fellowships go to young
scholars who wish to explore grad-
uate interests in order to determine
whether they wish to enter teach-
ing and scholarship careers. Hum-
mers, 21, will study English at the
University of Indiana.

Two other students have been
awarded Fulbright Scholarships for
graduate study next year in France
and Germany. Frank W. Ling, of
Roanoke, Virginia, a freshman law

at Ludwig Maximilians University
in Muenchen, Germany. Joseph W.
Frazier, of Tampa, Florida, a Euro-
pean history major, will study
French history at the University,
Faculte des Lettres, Aix, France.

THE 1957 CALYX was dedicated
not to a person, but to the commem-
oration of the 150th anniversary of
the birth of General Robert E. Lee.

In a prologue, the Calyx editors
stated, “Not only do we respect
General Lee as a man who believed
in a cause and gave all to defend
this cause, but also a man whose
guidance and faith formed the
foundation on which Washington
and Lee has grown to its present
stature. ‘Thus, in the realization
of this fact, the staff of the 1957
Calyx has dedicated the yearbook
to Robert Edward Lee, the man and
the ideal.”’

Introduction and departmental
division pages were printed in red,
blue, and black ink on light gray
antique paper. William H. Abeloff,
Richmond, Virginia, was editor of
the book. ‘The yearbook’s annual
beauty queen was Miss Wilma
Core, of Hammond, Louisiana, who
was selected by TV star Steve Allen.

 

# A LAW PROFESSOR who couldn’t
teach classes because of a slipped

SUMMER 1957

 

Law Professor WiLFrReD Ritz may look like he’s taking it easy, but he isn’t. Confined to
his bed with a back injury, he nevertheless continued teaching his law classes in April
and May with a special microphone hook-up devised by two of his students—one a
telephone company man, the other a physics instructor. It all worked out successfully.

disc in his back last spring chal-
lenged the ingenuity of his students.

Professor Wilfred J. Ritz teaches
two courses required for gradua-
tion, Agency and Conflicts. When
doctors told him he would not be
able to get out of bed, it looked
as though he was through teaching
for the year and his students were
going to miss some important lec-
tures in both courses.

But Samuel L. Davidson, a senior
law student, and Charles W. Gunn,
Jr., an intermediate student, came
up with the answer—a_ two-way
telephone hook-up which would
permit Ritz to teach from his bed-
room, ask questions of the class, and
hear answers and questions in re-
turn.

It was a cinch, since Gunn works
as general commercial manager for
the Lexington ‘Telephone Com-
pany. He borrowed the necessary
equipment and plugged in on both
the student lounge telephone at the
law school and the Ritz home
phone. Davidson, a parttime physics
instructor at Washington and Lee,
designed and built a microphone

boom which would enable Professor
Ritz to talk from his immobile po-
sition but still have his hands free
to hold notes or textbooks.

‘The class heard Ritz’s voice trom
a speaker in the base of a “hands-
free’”” phone set on one of the class-
room desks. A small but powerful
microphone picked up_ student’s
questions. ‘The teacher heard the
class comments over a small speak-
er which Davidson attached to
Ritz’s regular telephone. He said he
missed seeing class reaction to his
lectures, but he agreed the arrange-
ment was the best possible solution
under the circumstances. And 60
students completed necessary work
in the course.

m SENIOR LAW STUDENT Robert R.
Huntley of Winston-Salem, North
Carolina, was awarded the annual
Washington Literary Society award
in May for “‘the most distinguished
service to Washington and Lee”
of any graduating student.

A former vice-president of the
student body, Huntley was recog-
nized as a student whose impression

7

upon the university will be lasting,
according to the citation.

During his seven years at Wash-
ington and Lee in undergraduate
and law schools, Huntley was a
member of Phi Beta Kappa, Om1-
cron Delta Kappa, and the Order
of the Coif. He was an editor of
the Law Review the past year.

 

a BILL MCCANN, popular basketball
and baseball coach at Washington
and Lee for the past five years, re-
signed this summer to accept the
job of head basketball coach at the
University of Virginia, his alma
mater.

Succeeding him is Louis (“Wee-
nie’) Miller, chosen from “‘liter-
ally dozens of applicants,” who for
the past two years has enjoyed sig-
nal success coaching the two sports
at Hampden-Sydney College.

Miller has never produced a loser
at Hampden-Sydney in either
basketball or baseball and his teams
have been powers in the Mason-
Dixon Conference. His basketball
teams posted a 15-11 and 14-12
record, during the two years he was
coach, while the baseball team won
the conference title both years. At
Washington and Lee, he will be
coaching without the benefit of ath-
letic scholarships, although one top-
flight basketball man, Dom Flora,
will be playing his last year in
57-58 as a scholarship holder. Dom
was granted a scholarship just be-
fore the amateur policy was adopt-
ed.

McCann succeeds Evan J. (“Bus”)
Male at Wahooland, and Male will
become business manager of ath-
letics. McCann, regarded as one of
the area’s finest young coaches,
guided the Generals to their first
20-victory basketball season in his-
tory last winter. ‘The team was sec-
ond only to powerful West Virginia
in the conference tournament in
March.

This grinning foursome, gathered under the trees after commencement exercises on June 7,

have all graduated now to bigger things. The fellow without the mortarboard, basketball

coach Bit, McCann, will be coaching the Wahoo cagers come December. The other three,

all stars on MCCANN’s Mink team the past year, are left to right, LEE MARSHALL, BARRY

Strorick, and Barciay SmiruH, three big reasons why Washington and Lee had its first
20-victory basketball season in 1957.

Commented McCann, “I have
always wanted to return to Vir-
ginia as long as I can remember.
The basketball job there has been
my goal since I started coaching
ten years ago.” He praised Wash-
ington and Lee as “a wonderful
school.” His resignation was ac-
cepted, “with the deepest regret”
by President Francis P. Gaines.

Miller, father of three children,
also succeeds McCann at their
Lexington residence. ‘The Millers
moved in the McCann’s_ former
home on campus in August.

= JOHN Jj. FOx of Bluefield, West
Virginia, was named Washington
and Lee’s outstanding athlete for
1956-57. Fox, a four-year letterman
on the swimming team, holds the
school record in the breast stroke
and butterfly events at all distances,
and this year was the Big Six and
Southern Conference _ butterfly
champion.

During the past year, Washing-
ton and Lee athletic teams won 74
contests, while losing 66, although
only five teams posted winning sea-
sons—basketball (20-7); soccer (8-4);

 

swimming (8-1); golf (5-1); and la-

Dr. F. E>pwArp LUND, ’33

Taking office on October 1 as
president of Kenyon College will be
Dr. F. Edward Lund, ’33, who has
headed Alabama College in Monte-
vallo, Alabama, since 1952. He was
unanimously elected by Kenyon
trustees in late June to be president
of the 133-year-old men’s college,
oldest liberal arts school for men
west of the Alleghenies. ‘The college,
located at Gambier in central
Ohio, was established by the first
Episcopal bishop in the Northwest

Territory in 1824 and consists of an
undergraduate department and a
seminary, Bexley Hall. In the re-
cent Chicago Tribune survey, Ken-
yon was ranked third best men’s
college in the country.

Dr. Lund was born in Anhui,
China, the son of Episcopal mis-
sionaries. He received his Bachelor
of Arts degree cum laude in 1938
from Washington and Lee, and his
Master’s degree in 1934. From 1935-
38, he was an instructor at Wash-
ington and Lee, and then taught at
the .University of Wisconsin as
professor of European history. He
has been chairman of the depart-
ment of history and social science,
as well as dean at State Teachers’
College in Florence, Alabama.

He has served as president of the
Tennessee Valley Convocation of
Episcopal Laymen, and state di-
rector of the Crusade for Freedom.
He has been active as president of
the Alabama Association of College
Administrators; vice-president of
the Alabama Historical Association;
and as trustee of the Birmingham
Foreign Policy Association. He is a
member of the state committee on
international fellowships of Rotary
International.

The Chicago Tribune Ranks
Washington and Lee
Ninth Best Men’s College

N ANOTHER ACCOLADE to its fine
I reputation throughout the na-
tion, Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has been ranked as the ninth
best men’s college in the United
States in an extensive survey by the
Chicago Tribune.

‘The survey was the first authori-
tative rating of America’s leading
educational institutions in more
than twenty years, and the first
such rating ever conducted inde-
pendently by a newspaper.

‘To arrive at its conclusions, the
Tribune interviewed fifty universi-
ty and college presidents, deans, ad-
ministrative officers, scholars, and
scientists in the United States and
abroad. ‘The educators rated the
schools on the basis of its faculty
members; the quality of the re-
search produced (as measured by
publication); the scholastic apti-
tude, intellectual curiosity and de-
votion to serious study of the stu-
dent body; the physical facilities of
the schools; and—most important—
the “ethos” of the institution, that
is, whether it has the character of
a community of scholars. Such an
atmosphere, said the educators,
must include faculty members with
a genius for cultivating young
minds. This interaction between
the mind of the scholar and the
mind of the student presupposes

10

“superior students, selected for
their scholastic aptitude, intellec-
tual curiosity, and devotion to ser-
ious study.”

‘The results of these lists were syn-
thesized, then measured against a
compilation of data accumulated by
the Tribune. These objective data
included information on the col-
leges attended by persons listed in
Who’s Who in America, the schools
where science Ph.D.’s received their
initial training, the institutions
where National Science Foundation
scholarships are awarded, and the
colleges which National Merit
Scholarship recipients choose to
attend.

From the composite of all this
information, final evaluations were
made. According to the tabulation,
the ten best men’s colleges are:

b—

Haverford in Pennsylvania
Amherst, Massachusetts

. Kenyon, Ohio

. Wesleyan, Connecticut

. Hamilton, New York

. Union, New York

7. Bowdoin, Maine

8. University of the South, ‘Ten-
nessee

g. Washington and Lee, Vir-
ginia

10. Williams, Massachusetts.

Institutions in other categories,
in order of their rating, are as fol-
lows:

Universities: Harvard, Yale, Uni-
versity of California (Berkeley),
University of Chicago, Columbia,
Princeton, Michigan, Cornell, Wis-
consin, and Stanford.

Coeducational Colleges: Oberlin,
Swarthmore, Carleton, Reed, Po-
mona, Grinnell, Lawrence (Wis-
consin), College of Wooster, Kala-
mazoo, and Hope.

Women’s Colleges: Bryn Mawr,
Radcliffe, Barnard, Vassar, Mount
Holyoke, Wellesley, Smith, Gou-
cher, Pembroke, and Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College.

President Francis P. Gaines said,
“I. am indeed pleased with the
rating that Washington and Lee
University received in the ‘Greatest
Schools in the Nation’ survey. The
findings, I feel, explicitly and au-
thoritatively report what we at this
university have sincerely believed
for some time. The findings of the
survey are a monument to the
progress we have made and a testi-
mony of our efforts. I know, with
all confidence, that we shall con-
tinue to strive for further improv-
ment and the further enhancement
of the fine reputation we already
enjoy.”

with a target date for completion of
the job September, 1958. ”~

The dining hall-dormitory pro-
ject will include a university “com-
mons” or dining hall two small
dormitories for upperclassmen and
law students, remodeling the pres-
ent Student Union building and
the addition of a new wing to this

of trustees will decide to proceed

SUMMER 1957

out $1,250,000

with all or part of the plans at a
later date, after bids have been
submitted by contractors.
Designed to accommodate 525
persons under normal seating ar-
rangements and 650 under banquet
conditions, the dining hall will in-
clude a main hall, three special
dining rooms, kitchens, lounges,
coat rooms, and offices for supervis-
ory personnel. Exterior design will
embody the familiar columned fea-
tures of Washington and Lee’s mod-
ified Greek Revival architecture.
Dormitory units will be small,

two-story structures, each provid-

ing modern living quarters for ap-
proximately 4o men. One unit is
earmarked for upperclassmen in the
undergraduate schools, while the
other will be for exclusive use of
the law school.

Location of the dormitories will
permit construction of a companion
building at some future date to
form a U-shaped building cluster.

The entire project is to be lo-
cated on Washington street, oppo-
site the president's home and near
the present Freshman Dormitory.
Plans show the dining hall as the
central unit, connecting with Stu-

of the dormitories on the other
by covered walkways.

The Student Union will be re-

ASHINGTON AND LEE played

host to a three-class anniver-
sary reunion on the weekend of
May g-11, and more than 160
alumni of the classes of 1907, 1917,
and 1932 came back to Lexington
for a good time. They represented
twenty-three states and the District
of Columbia.

To reacquaint alumni with
Washington and Lee as it is today, a

The President of the Alumni Association reports

Another Busy Year

By MartTIN P. Burks, ITI, ’32

OOKING OVER THE FILE of cor-
L respondence in relation to
matters which I have accumulated
over the past year, I had supposed
that there would be a great many
matters to report to you at this
meeting, but the fact is that while
the members of the Alumni Board
and your President have been both
active and verbose, there is not
much of a very tangible nature to
tell you about.

I can, of course, say—and with
deep sincerity—that it has been a
rare privilege to be associated with
the able and devoted alumni who
serve as members of the Board of
Trustees and, with them, to come
into intimate contact with the af-
fairs, the aspirations and the ac-
complishments of this great Uni-
versity. And with equal sincerity,
I can express appreciation for the
Opportunity to work with “Cy”
Young, who justly enjoys the es-
teem and affection of thousands
of Washington and Lee men all
over America. The activity of the
Alumni Office under “Cy’s” guid-
ance is a marvelous thing to see, and
its accomplishments for the welfare
of the University are legion. _

‘The Alumni Board has been as
busy about the affairs of your Asso-
Clation as in any year of my con-
nection with it. ‘There have been
the regular Fall and Spring meet-
ings here in Lexington with agenda
so long that we could barely reach
all of the items. There has been
much committee work and_ the
individual members have been
in close association with campus
affairs by means of personal visits
and frequent telephone conversa-
tions and letters.

The projects which have chiefly
engaged our attention are the pro-
vision of an adequate staff for the

14

Alumni Office, the fostering of the
Alumni Fund, continued planning
for an Alumni Clubhouse, appro-
priate recognition of retiring facul-
ty members, consideration of a new
Washington and Lee moving pic-
ture, and the constant maintenance
of haison between the alumni and
the University administration.

You will recall that last year we
were fortunate in enlisting the serv-
ices of James H. Price, Jr., as As-
sociate Alumni Secretary. We had
hoped to be able to keep him for
much-needed help in the expanding
program of alumni activity, but he
found it necessary to resign this
spring to take advantage of an at-
tractive business opportunity. We
have since given much thought to
the advisability of reorganizing and
expanding the Alumni staff to pro-
vide for needed assistance in the
editing of publications and the or-
ganization of the annual Alumni
Fund Campaign—and we have also
begun the search for a successor
to the irreplaceable “Cy” Young,

 

MarTIN P. Burks, ILI, ’32

who seems determined to retire
next June.

I am glad to say that the Alumni
Fund, sparked by the Fund Coun-
cil, whose able chairman is Graham
Morison, and constantly shepherded
by “Cy” Young and Don Smith,
seems headed toward another suc-
cessful year. The goal this year is
$115,000.co and 4,000 contributors
and with a little less than a month
to gO we can now count $94,399.71
and 2,990 contributors. I cannot too
earnestly commend this effort to
you, for the good health of this
independent University depends in-
creasingly upon the steady, annual
and generous support of her alum-
ni. I hope we shall all come to real-
ize that Washington and Lee should
have a place in our regular sched-
ule of giving along with our church
and community fund pledges, for
certain it is that the independent
functions of such universities as this
one is one of the bulwarks of
American freedom.

I can report to you also that
while the much discussed Alumni
Clubhouse is not yet a reality, we
have succeeded in keeping the idea
alive in the thinking of University
Trustees and Administrators and
we are hopeful that this thinking
will bear fruit in the early execu-
tion of plans for additional Uni-
versity facilities.

Finally, on the score of haison
between the Alumni and the Uni-
versity administration, I should like
to say that the members of the
Alumni Board have tried to repre-
sent the varied and sometimes con-
flicting views of alumni as to the ul-
timate welfare of Washington and
Lee, but with due regard for the au-
thority and responsibility of the
constituted authorities. It has
seemed to us that the proper func-
tion of an alumni association is to
act as counsellor rather than as dic-
tator, not fostering discord but re-
membering always that this is our
University, right or wrong, and
through thick and thin.

The Alumni Secretary recounts

A Year in Review

By Harry K. (Cy) Youne, ‘17

F COURSE ALL OF US realize that

fund raising is no longer a
haphazard affair. In line with the
present trend, the mapping out and
execution of the Alumni Fund now
consumes a great part of our effort.
‘The figures for our first Fund, in
1933, (535 contributors for $3,700)
indicated that only six percent of
our list contributed to Alma Mater.
On June 7, 1956, we reported to
you that 2,810 alumni had made
gifts totalling $88,289 to the Alumni
Fund. ‘Today, Iam reporting to you
an even larger number of contribu-
tors and more money: 2,990 for
$94,399-51-

On June go of last year, 3,363
alumni had contributed $100,931,
or 31 per cent of those solicited. An
interesting factor is that last year
48 per cent of all graduates con-
tributed. We now compare favor-
ably with the best Funds in the

 

President WoovwarbD, 40

SUMMER 1957

country in percentage of graduate
giving.

On April 21, a Chicago Tribune
study placed Washington and Lee
ninth within the category of the
“top ten male colleges” in America.
Now that we are in the big ten
academically, our goal is to place
in a “top ten Alumni Fund group.”

Whatever success the Fund
achieves this year can be credited
largely to the g2 Class Agents, 105
Regional Agents, and approximate-
ly 400 Committeemen serving in
our behalf. Jim Price was entirely
responsible for enlisting the serv-
ices of our Regional Agents. We
were sorry to lose him from our
staff on March 1.

* * *

No new alumni chapters were
organized during the year. How-
ever, the activities of the 37 we now
have were more vigorous than in
many recent years. These local
chapters have been especially help-
ful in the recruitment and apprais-
al of prospective Washington and
Lee students. Each chapter has held
at least one meeting during the
year; most of the chapters have held
several meetings, and in practically
every case the University had a
representative present to bring the
alumni up to date on campus ac-
tivities. A new practice at these
meetings is that of inviting as
guests the local boys who have been
accepted for admission at Washing-
ton and Lee; in many cases the par-
ents are included. Certainly part of
the increase in our Alumni Fund
can be attributed to the fine coop-
eration of our alumni chapters who

act as liaison between the com-
munity and the University.

For the third year we have en-
tertained alumni classes celebrating
their 25th reunions; last year we
added the 50-year class and _ this
year the 40-year men were included.
‘These men, most of them bringing
their wives, were guests of the Uni-
versity. During this Reunion-Con-
vocation period we try to give the
alumni a picture of the Washing-
ton and Lee of today, and we also
try to give them an idea of what
we are planning for the future. ‘The
25-year reunion class this year, °32
academic and law, made a gift of
$5,720 to the Alumni Fund desig-
nated as a memorial to their de-
ceased classmates.

Our special thanks go to the
Alumni Committee of the Faculty
and the Faculty Reunion Commit-
tee for making the Reunion a suc-
cessful occasion, and especially do
we want to thank the arrangements
chairman, James Farrar.

* * *

We feel that our alumni, scat-
tered as they are, are now well-
informed on University affairs.
Much time has been spent this year
by our office staff in removing
“deadwood” from the files. I hope

 

Vice-President JOHNSON, ’21

BEN W. Ditto, °43

member of the Alumni Board of Trustees

it will not shock you to know that
1,800 ex-students (who spent a year
or less on our campus) have been
removed from our mailing list.
Our records in these cases show that
no interest had ever been expressed
by these alumni—by return of ques-
tionnaire, letter of information,
fund gift, or in any way. Most of
them finished their education at
other institutions. “Through the
Regional Agents, we learned of
many instances where these men
were not interested and did not
wish to be solicited. ‘Thus we have
dropped their names from our ac-
tive files. In eliminating this group
we are now better able to con-
centrate on the 9,400 alumni who
constitute our active list—most of
whom have indicated interest in
receiving The Alumni Magazine,
The President’s Report, bulletins
from the Development Office, Class
Agent letters, and other informa-
tive University literature.

* * *

Before I finish this report, I must
enter one complaining note—and
you will recognize it 1s not a new
complaint. Our great difficulty here
continues to be a lack of facilities.
We have little space in which to

15

 

carry on our increasing alumni en-
deavor. We hope relief from these
congestcd conditions will be coming
soon.

In spite of the crowded and
confusing office conditions, and in
the midst of strenuous activities, the
staffs of the Alumni Office and of
the Development Office have coop-
erated cheerfully and_ tirelessly.
They have been of the greatest pos-
sible help. It has been a pleasure
to work with them.

And it has been a pleasure to
work with and to be guided by our
Alumni Board and its President,
Martin Burks; the Alumni Fund
Council and its Chairman, Graham
Morison; and Don Smith, our Di-
rector of Development.

The Virginia Foundation makes a report:

A Gain in Depth of Support

‘The twelve colleges of Virginia which receive no tax support have or-
ganized The Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges, particularly in
an effort to enlist corporate giving. The Foundation continued to gain in
scope and depth of support in the fourth year. In the year ending April 30,
1957, there were 250 investors, compared with 181 the previous year. A total
of $330,600 was contributed, compared with $287,025 in the preceding year.
To prove a strong sustained interest, almost ninety-five per cent of the
previous year’s supporters renewed or increased their backing, and thirty-
six contributors substantially boosted the levels of their previous invest-

ments.
