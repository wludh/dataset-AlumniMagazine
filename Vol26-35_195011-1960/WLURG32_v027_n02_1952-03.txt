A Scholarly Faculty

Washington and Lee is a teach-
ing institution, whose faculty mem-
bers are chosen primarily because
of their excellence in the classroom,
not because of their research and
publication. It is well known, how-
ever, that a writing faculty is an
alert faculty—one which does not
rest upon last year’s notes or last
decade’s materials. With steadily
increasing frequency the Wash-
ington and Lee faculty members
have been engaging in scholarly
enterprise.

Despite the fact that each teacher
has a full classroom schedule con-
siderably more than half of the
men on the university’s faculty
have within the past three years
published books, articles in learned
journals, critical reviews, and other
scholarly essays.

It was noted in the President’s
1949 report to the Board of Trus-
tees that “since the war eleven of
the staff have written books and
thirty-six have published articles.”
That record is now even more im-
pressive.

2

A great impetus to scholarly
achievement was provided by the
Carnegie Foundation for the Ad-
vancement of Teaching. In 1951
that Foundation generously made
available to the university $25,000
to inaugurate a program of grants-
in-aid to faculty members over a
period of three years.

In the first year of the program,
twenty-four of the faculty mem-
bers—more than a third of those
eligible to apply—received assist-
ance from the Carnegie Fund, and
in the second (current) year,
an additional twenty have been
awarded grants. These figures are
an indication of the eagerness with
which the teaching faculty mem-
bers pursue research in_ their
chosen fields. The stimulating re-
sults have already become appar-
ent in increased publications and
in classroom instruction.

Since 1949 six more books have
been published under the names
of faculty members:

Professor L. L. Barrett, of the
Spanish department, has translated

 

from the Portuguese a novel of the
ereat Brazilian author, Erico Ver-
issimo, Time and the Wind (Mac-
millan, 1951)

Professor R. Foster Bradley, of
the French department, together
with R. B. Mitchell, has edited
a widely used anthology of
French literature: Eight Centuries
of French Literature (Appelton-
Crofts-Century, 1951).

Professor Marshall W.  Fish-
wick, in the field of American
Studies, has published Virginians
on Olpmpus (1950), a study of
hero worship in the Old Domin-
ion; a preliminary checklist of writ-
ings about R. E. Lee; and several
other useful bibliographies.

Professor William A. Jenks, of
the history department, was the
author of The Austrian Electoral
Reform of 1907 (Columbia).

Professor Edward D. Myers, of
the philosophy department, was
the editor of a notable collection
of essays entitled Christianity and
Reason (Oxford).

Professor Marcellus H. Stow, of
the geology department, was the
editor of a monumental report on
The James River Basin: Past,
Present, and Future.

Other books are ready for publi-
cation or are near completion. Pro-
fessor L. J. Desha is awaiting
proofs of an entirely revised sec-
ond edition of his textbook on or-
ganic chemistry. Professor James
Lewis Howe is continuing his def-
initive bibliography of the plati-
num metals, of which two volumes
are already published. Professor
Lewis K. Johnson has almost com-
pleted a book on sales manage-
ment, and Professor M. O. Phillips
is currently revising his Jndus-
trial and Commercial Geography
(in collaboration with J. Russell
Smith). Professor Fitzgerald Flour-
noy is at work upon a volume en-
titled Hugh Blair Grigsby and His
Virginia.

In addition to these, several pro-
fessors, under the Carnegie grant,
have begun work upon projects

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

that will result in books: Profes-
sor E. S. Gilreath (qualitative an-
alysis in chemistry); Professor E.
C. Griffith (labor problems in a
capitalistic economy); and Profes-
sor Charles W. Turner (history of
the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway).

The articles published by faculty
members in the learned journals,
and the critical reviews written,
are too numerous to mention, but
32 such scholarly productions
have been reported within the last
two years. In addition many mem-
bers of the staff have presented
papers at the annual meetings of
scholarly and professional societies.

Members of the Law School
have been active in their field. Pro-
fessor Charles R. McDowell gave
a paper at the annual meeting of
the Virginia State Bar Association.
Professor C. P. Light has prepared
an analysis of a Brookings Institute
Report on “The Administration of
Foreign Affairs and Overseas Op-
eration,” which was adopted by
the Assistant Secretary of the
Army as the Department of the
Army’s position in this controver-
sial organizational field. Professor
C. V. Laughlin prepared the sum-

mary of West Virginia Procedure
for students preparing for bar ex-
amination. Dean Clayton E. Wil-
liams is a member of the sub-com-
mittee on Qualifications to the
Bar, Virginia Advisory Legislative
Council.

An outstanding work was that of
Professor O. W. Riegel, who com-
piled a noteworthy 110 page re-
port, “Public Opinion Research
Training in Western Germany”
for the State Department. To
gather first hand material for this
report Professor Riegel was sent
to Europe during the summer of
1950, where he made a survey in
Western Germany and Berlin. In
addition to his report Professor
Riegel has made several talks on
his observations during the trip.

Professor George H. Foster has
written several pamphlets on re-
quest of the U.S. Navy on aircraft
electrical systems, pilot ejection
from high-speed, high altitude
aircraft, and jet fuel consumption
problems.

Two of the more interesting
faculty projects concern the fine
arts. Professor Marion Junkin,
after a special study in Mexico of

the techniques of mural painting by
the great Mexican artists, is now
engaged in the painting of a mural
in the University Library. Work
on the mural, which is on the sub-
ject of man’s struggle for intellec-
tual freedom, is attracting much
attention from students. Professor
B. S. Stephenson, in cooperation
with the student Concert Guild,
directed and presented an opera by
Gian-Carlo Menotti, The Medium.

Aside from the creative work
noted, most of the faculty members
are engaged in civic enterprises,
such as the Red Cross, the Com-
munity Chest, and the Tubercu-
losis Association; while many
others are in constant demand for
addresses to school and _ civic
groups.

It is notable that practically all
of the full professors at the Uni-
versity are listed in Who’s Who.
The record of the scholarly achieve-
ment of the Washington and Lee
staff is a remarkable one, probably
not equalled by any other institu-
tion of its size in the country. The
results are discernible in the gen-
eral air of intellectual stimulation
on the campus.

 

Alumni Named “Men ot the Year”

John F. Watlington, Jr., is the
Charlotte, North Carolina News’
Man of the Year. The Man of the
Year Award was established by the
Charlotte News in 1944 to honor
the citizen who had made an out-
standing contribution to the com-
munity in that year. Seven Men
of the Year have been chosen since
that time and this group of seven
selected the Man of the Year in
1951.

It was mainly his work in di-
recting Community Chest activities
and in doing much as a sort of
good-will ambassador for Char-
lotte over a large adjoining region
which prompted the board in se-
lecting Mr. Watlington. He is cur-
rent president of the Chest, which

includes 21 social agencies, but
his friend, Stowe Moody, is the pre-
siding officer. Since he became
active in Chest work about three
years ago, he has taken off from
his duties as senior vice-president
of the Wachovia Bank & Trust
Company, in charge of the Char-
lotte office to make many speeches
in connection with the organiza-
tion of Chest drives in communi-
ties in his own and adjoining states.
The campaign which he planned
and directed for Charlotte, as co-
worker with Mr. Moody, was dis-
tributed nationally as an example
to other Chests.

Mr. Watlington does not con-
fine his activities to the local chest,
which last year went many thou-

sand dollars above the goal of
$386,500. He has served for sev-
eral years on the Advisory Board
of the Salvation Army in Charlotte,
and from 1945 to this year, was on
the Board of Directors of the local
Family and Children’s Service,
being president of that organiza-
tion in 1949,

Mr. Watlington was born in
Reidsville, N. C.; attended the
Reidsville public schools, and then
came to Washington and Lee,
where he was a member of the
Beta Theta Pi social fraternity and
was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in
his senior year. After graduation,
he attended the Graduate School
of Banking at Rutgers University.
Following in the footsteps of his
father, who was president of the
Bank of Reidsville, he began work
in the Winston-Salem branch of
Wachovia, was moved to Charlotte,
and in a comparatively short time
has climbed to the top in_busi-
ness and civic ranks.

 

Emil C. Rassman *41

Emil C. Rassman, III, was
named one of the five “Outstanding
Young Men of Texas for 1951,”
by the Texas Junior Chamber of
Commerce. Announcement of the
selection was made at a banquet
given by the Texas Junior Cham-
ber of Commerce at San Antonio

Monogram Designer Honored

Washington and Lee University
and its alumni everywhere are
eternally indebted to ‘Thomas
Greene (Tubby) Stone, ’04, for
his achievement in designing the
official University monogram. In
recognition of this service the
Alumni Association of the Uni-
versity, on January 4, 1952,
presented to Mr. Stone a_ hand-
some plaque bearing the inscrip-
tion: “Presented to Thomas Greene
(Tubby) Stone, designer of the
Washington and Lee monogram,
worn with pride by the sons of the
University throughout the years.
In grateful appreciation by the
Alumni Association.”

The annals of the University
show that Mr. Stone, in addition to
this accomplishment, was also an
outstanding athlete. He played
center and was captain of the foot-
ball team, stroke and captain of

 

——

Stone, Football Captain ’04

 

on January 19, 1952. Final de-
cision as to the selection of the
five outstanding young ‘Texans was
made on such achievements as ex-
traordinary talent, initiative and
outstanding contributions to their
professions and to the general wel-
fare of the people. Rassman has
gained widespread recognition
throughout the state in the legal
profession, particularly in connec-
tion with West Texas water rights.
His representation of the State of
Texas in the Tidelands controversy
in Austin and Washington is
termed “outstanding” by ‘Texas
lawyers.

In addition to his selection in the
state-wide award, Rassman was
chosen as the “Outstanding Young
Man of 1951” by the Midland,
Texas, Junior Chamber of Com-
merce at its luncheon meeting on
December 28. A Midland resident
since 1948, he has been active in
civic, youth, welfare and church
work. He is the immediate past
president of the Midland Optimist

Club, which had for its major pro-
ject last year the building and
equipping of a boys’ workshop. He
also has been instrumental in or-
gvanizing a Boy Scout troop and
a Sunday School class at the work-
shop. He is secretary of the Vestry
and has taught in the Sunday
School class at Trinity Episcopal
Church in Midland; is president
of the Midland Scottish Rite Club,
and a former vice-president of the
Junior Chamber of Commerce,

After graduating from Wash-
ington and Lee he received the
LL.B. degree from the University
of Texas Law School. He enlisted
in the service in World War II as a
private and was released as a cap-

The monogram, a blue WL in
the form of a trident on a white
background or vice-versa a white
trident on a blue background, the
University colors, was designed by
Mr. Stone, while a student, and
presented to and accepted by the
University as its official mono-
eram.

The WL trident has, through-
out the years, grown to be far more
than a monogram. It is an emblem,
a symbol of the high standards of
the University. It stands for and
represents the teachings of Robert
E. Lee, the honor system and all
other outstanding and noble char-
acteristics of the University and
its student bodies. It was patterned
after Neptune’s famous trident, his
emblem as ruler of the seas and
though it cannot assure rulership in
the athletic realm, yet, it does stand
for, and is symbolic of, honest clean
and sportsmanlike conduct in all
athletic contests.

Thomas Greene (Tubby) Stone, ’04, accepts a plaque from Wilbur R. Hampton, ’09,
presented by the Alumni Association of Washington and Lee University in rec-
ognition of his work in designing the official monogram of the University. The
presentation was made Friday, January 4, 1952 at Mr. Stone’s home at Union Mills,
N. C. Others pictured are (left to right): Mrs. Stone, and Washington and Lee
alumni J. Davis Kerr, ’24, H. J. Blackford, ’17, and H. R. Phillips, ’11.

 

University Has Marching Band

They said it couldn’t be done,
but it has. Washington and Lee
has a marching band.

Under the supervision of Lt.
Col. John G. Bowes of the military
department, and the student di-
rection of Dave Comegys, the band
was formed at the beginning of
the school year and has grown to
thirty pieces. To date the new or-
ganization has played at all pep
rallies, all home and two away
football games, the annual “Torch-
light Parade,” the Student War
Memorial Fund Committee’s “Corn
Bowl,” and_ several basketball
games. In addition it presented
a Christmas concert in Lee Chapel.

The band is now officially known
as the Washington and Lee R. O.
T. C. Band and is entirely com-
posed of students who have volun-

teered their services. It contains one
flute, one piccolo, five clarinets,
four saxophones, six cornets, three
trombones, one French horn, one
baritone, two sousaphones, six per-
cusion drums, and one glocken-
spiel. The original complement of
instruments was furnished by the
Army and at the time of the instru-
ment requisition it was thought
that the band would be small so
only sixteen instruments were re-
ceived. But as can be seen, the in-
terest and response has been amaz-
ing, the remainder of the instru-
ments being furnished by the stu-
dents themselves.

Included in the organization are
former members of some of the na-
tion’s outstanding high school
bands. Comegys played four years
with the Byrd High School’s

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

(Shreveport) Louisiana state cham-
pionship band while Conrad Mc-
Eachern played for the Vivian
High School band, another top-
fighter in Louisiana. Among
others, Forney Daugette played
with the Sewanee Military Aca-
demy Band.

Football games and pep rallies
have been considerably enlivened
by the band and school spirit at
athletic contests has noticeably im-
proved. The band’s biggest success
to date was the “Corn Bow!” per-
formance when the organization
presented some humorous and
tricky marching formations.

The Christmas Concert was sur-
prisingly well attended. A varied
program was presented including
two John Philip Sousa marches,
music by Stephen Foster, The

5

 

Donkey Seranade, a march ar-
rangement of Onward Christian
Soldiers, and Christmas music.
High points for the band were
two out-of-town trips; to Knoxville
for the University of Tennessee
football game, and to Richmond
for the Thanksgiving tilt with
Richmond University. The Ten-

Name Your Candidates

In compliance with Article 9 of the By-Laws of the Wash-
ington and Lee Alumni, Inc., we are listing below the names of
the Nominating Committee for the coming year.

Under the revised By-Laws any member of the Association
may submit the names of alumni to fill the vacancies on the Alumni
Board of Trustees and for the alumni representatives on the
University Athletic Committee.

There are three vacancies to be filled on the Alumni Board
of ‘Trustees, and two on the Athletic Committee at the June ’52
meeting of the Alumni Association. Members of the Association
are urged to submit names of their candidates for these offices.
The Nominating Committee will close its report on May 22.

The Committee is as follows: Richard T. Edwards, 733,
Chairman, Colonial American National Bank Building, Roanoke,
Va.; Charles L. Claunch, ’29, 1023 Chattanooga Bank Building,
Chattanooga, Tennessee; S. S. McNeer, 716, First Huntington
National Bank Building, Huntington, W. Va.

ceived a rousing ovation from the
large Washington and Lee delega-
tion.

Now the band is definitely on its
feet and an established fact, plans
are being formulated for this
spring and the coming year. In the
near future the membership will
be increased to forty. During the
spring it will present another con-
cert, play for all ROTC parades,
and the annual military govern-
ment inspection. Next year the
band hopes to be included on
the Athletic Association’s budget
which would stabalize it financially.
It is hoped that a new band room
will be obtained. The organization
is now using the old one room
building behind the gymnasium
and it is proving too small. Plans
for next year include a continued
increase in membership, to fifty or
more, and more trips.

Members wear the regularly
authorized ROTC uniform. They
practice one or two hours per week,
more if something special is on
the ledger. All practices are volun-
tary but Director Comegys says
attendance has been remarkably
good. To date not one member has
dropped from the band of his own
accord.

Previous attempts have been
made to form marching bands at
Washington and Lee but this is
the first time that real success has
been achieved. University officials
state the new organization fulfils
a long need and athletic officials are
enthusiastic over the band’s perfor-
mance at games. Students were
prone to make fun of the organiza-
tion during its first days but it is
without a doubt that the band has
now proved itself to all concerned.

University officials give full
credit to the ROTC department,
and to Colonel Bowes and Captain
George L. Brashears in particular,
for their interest and cooperation.
The interest and work of student
director Comegys, the officials add,
took the band over the hump.
So—from this day forward it’s,
“There’s nothing like a hometown

Outstanding Speakers on Campus

By J. W. BENJAMIN, JR., 754

 

It is an oddity of student psy-
chology that the undergraduate
often learns more while doing
things of his own free will than
he does when boning on compul-
sory school work. It is also true
that university life is composed of
many things in addition to studies
and classes. Sports, social life,
learning to care for one’s personal
affairs, extracurricular activities;
all are a part of education. In par-
ticipating in this outside-of-class
education the college student can
obtain a wealth of learning and
understanding by attending the
numerous speeches and_ lectures
presented on the campus during
the year.

Washington and Lee, conscious
of the above facts, is constantly
endeavoring to obtain outstand-
ing lecturers. Members of the
faculty or other interested persons
submit names to a central com-
mittee for obtaining speakers. The
committee, headed for over fifteen
years by Mr. Rupert N. Latture
of the Political Science Depart-
ment, coordinates the scheduling
of these guest speakers so as not
to interfere with each other, with
exams, dance weekends, or other
important occasions at the univer-
sity. It is responsible for corres-
pondence with the speaker, and
for the allocation of funds. Many
of the departments and organiza-
tions handle all arrangements
themselves, merely clearing with
the committee.

The university has few lecturers
who speak before the student body
as a whole (although usually the
lecture is open to anyone) but
rather the speakers are depart-
mental in nature, or talk under the
auspices of some university func-
tion or group such as the Omicron
Delta Kappa tapping, the South-
ern Interscholastic Press Associa-

tion Convention or the University
Religious Conference.

The ODK tapping always pre-
sents one of the outstanding speak-
ers of the year. In 1951 Norman
Cousins, editor of the Saturday Re-
view of Literature, spoke on “Com-
munism in the Far East.” Other
recent ODK speakers include Sen-
ator A. Willis Robertson (Va.),
and Dr. Oliver C. Carmichael,
President of the Carnegie Founda-
tion.

Phi Beta Kappa annually spon-
sors a guest speaker. In recent
years they have had Dr. Sidney
Painter, chairman of the Depart-
ment of History at Johns Hopkins;

Dr. Arthur Palmer Hudson, pro-
fessor of English at the University
of North Carolina; and Dr. John
E.. Orchard, head of the Geography
Department at Columbia, and as-
sociated with the ECA.

John Temple Graves has talked
to the student body several times in
recent years.

The university annually has a
Religious Conference sponsored by
the Christian Council. Among the
inspiring lecturers to come _ to
Washington and Lee for this week
have been Dr. John Oliver Nelson,
Dean at Large, Yale University;
Dr. Theodore Greene of Yale; Dr.
Raymond Lindquist, lst Church

 

 

Left to right: Kenneth P. Lane, ’36, Fred P. Guthrie, ’11, George E. Burks, ’27, the

>

Saturday Review,’

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

was the principal speaker.

Orange, New Jersey; and Dr. Elton
Trueblood of Earlham College in
Indiana.

The Law School brings the
John Randolph Tucker lecturer to
the campus. Last year John J.
Parker, Chief Judge, U. S. Court
of Appeals for the 4th Circuit,
spoke on the Nurnberg Trials and
A World Order Based on Law. In
1949 the speaker was the Honor-
able John W. Davis, former Am-
bassador to Great Britain, and
former Solicitor General of the
United States. The Honorable
Arthur T. Vanderbilt, Chief Jus-
tice, New Jersey State Supreme
Court, spoke in 1950.

Departmental lecturers are more
specialized, usually speaking on
a topic of specific interest to the
sponsoring department. A round-
table discussion usually follows.

The Lee Journalism Foundation
has a large and varied program
of visiting lecturers. In the past
year this department has sponsored,
among others, Fielder Cook, New
York television director; John Col-
burn, managing editor of the
Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch;
Shields Johnson, general manager
of the Roanoke (Va.) Times and
World News; Joe Ellis, editor and
publisher of the Clarksdale, Miss.,
Press Register; Louis Spilman,
editor of the Waynesboro (Va.)
News-Virginian; John H. Cline,
editor of the Washington Star;
Robert Estabrook, editorial writer
for the Star; Bill Polk of the
Greensboro (N. C.) News; Russell
Applegate, assistant advertising di-
rector of the duPont Corporation;
Dave Breger, famous cartoonist;
Leonard Maille, chief of the Amer-
ican Branch, British Broadcasting
Corporation; Charles Corddry,
United Press correspondent; Dud-
ley White, editor and publisher of
the Sandusky Register-Star News;
Morgan Beatty of the National
Broadcasting Company; and C. B.
Houck of the Houck Advertising
Agency, Roanoke, Va.

The Commerce Department re-
cently sponsored a series of lectures
and demonstrations on modern ac-

8

counting machines, by Mr. Roy
Witte of the Burroughs Company.
Other speakers for this school have
included Dr. John M. Clark, as-
sistant general manager of the
duPont Company; Dr. Charles
W. Williams, vice-president of the
kederal Reserve Bank, Richmond,
Va.; and Mr. Clem Johnston of
the U. S. Chamber of Commerce.

The English Department has
had Dr. Arthur Palmer Hudson
(mentioned before as a Phi Beta
Kappa speaker) who spoke on
Woodworth’s poetry, and con-
ducted a round-table discussion on
“Influence of Folklore on American
Literature.” Cleanth Brooks of
Yale spoke on Milton. Stephen
Spender, well known English poet,
lectured on “Trends of Modern
Criticism.” Robert Penn Warren,
writer and lecturer, discussed Wil-
liam Faulkner before a large au-
dience of English students.

Other departments present a
similar variety of speakers, lack
of space preventing a detailed list-
ing. The Political Science Depart-
ment recently had Senator Mike
Monroney (Okla.) to lecture be-
fore its students. The Biology De-
partment brought Dr. Edward
McCrady, acting president of
Sewanee University, and head of
the Biological Department of the
AEC at Oak Ridge, to the W. and
L. campus. Henry Hatfield spoke
on Thomas Mann for the German
Department. Dr. Americo Castro
of Princeton spoke to the Spanish
Department on Cervantes.

Campus organizations are active
in obtaining speakers. The Inter-
national Relations Club has had
Dr. Bayard Dodge, President of
the American University of Beirut
in Lebanon; Mr. Mirko Sedlak,
a member of the Czechoslovakian
Parliament before its overthrow
by the Communists; and Mr. John
Gange, head of the School of For-
eign Affairs, University of Vir-
ginia. The Debate Team had Wil-
liam Rees-Mogg and Richard Ta-
verne of Oxford University to de-
bate the forthcoming Churchill re-
gime in England.

In addition to all of these the
members of the faculty occasionally
give special lectures outside of
class. Dr. Gaines, University Pres-
ident, and one of the country’s out-
standing public speakers, talks be-
fore the student body several times
yearly. Last year he gave the
commencement address. Professor
Riegel of the Journalism Depart-
ment spoke this fall on “The State
of Europe,” a talk based upon his
observations made during a tour
of Europe for Princeton Univer-
sity last summer. Dean Leyburn
gave the opening address for the
1951-52 session and teaches a
weekly Sunday School class. Mr.
Ashley Brown of the English De-
partment spoke on “Recent Amer-
ican Literature”before the Graham-
Lee Literary Society last winter.

Naturally this has been only a
partial, but representative, sum-
mary of Washington and Lee’s
guest speakers. The parade of
outstanding lecturers on campus
has been steady for the last three
years. However, Mr. Latture says
the university has several prob-
lems to face in its procurement
of lecturers. One difficulty is the
lack of a general assembly hall.
Lee Chapel and Washington Hall
are too small for a speaker with
wide appeal, and Doremus Gym-
nasium is hardly conducive to aca-
demic lectures. Another problem is
the lack of a ready-made audience.
Washington and Lee students have
no regulations concerning the at-
tending of special lectures other
than University Assemblies. ‘There-
fore a special effort must be made
to give a speaker advance publicity.
However, students and faculty have
expressed themselves as being well
pleased with the program and
further improvement is contem-
plated.

A Message trom President Gaines

The gratitude of my heart for the excellent contributions here recorded is
paralleled by one other emotion—my sense of the importance of what you have

done.

Now that I think about it, I do not see how Washington and Lee could have
hoped for anything like a good year if the University had not received this help.
I treasure the assistance so greatly in the realm of the spirit, the testimony of
love and faith that you have offered, that I regret to descend to the fiscal level
Actually, however, the Alumni Fund of last year amounted, roughly speaking,
to the income for the time being earned by a million dollars of endowment.

‘Those of us who are beneficiaries of this generosity, impressive in its dimen-
sion and inspiring in its consequence, may lack the words of adequate thanks;
but the Alumni Fund takes its place among the forces of heritage. Of that heri-
tage we are immensely proud, for it we offer humble prayers of thanksgiving, and
to it we pledge renewals of devotion.

Upon pure generosity and the conviction thus represented, Washington and
Lee was founded. Upon the continuance of this largess of love, the University
has survived and grown. Its services, we may fairly claim, have been incalculable
for God and man, but every one of those services has been possible because some-
body loved the school, somebody shared with it.

Through its long history, there is no record of coerced support. For its future

there is no promise of compelled money. It will sustain its purpose only through
the large souls who believe and who help.

And I add with confidence that there has been no stage in that history when

Pouca foe es

the generosity of friends is more real as help.

WASHINGTON

To Members of the Washington and Lee
Alumni Association:

I am grateful for this oportunity to address
each one of the members of our Association. I also
want to thank those of you who responded last
vear to your Class Agent’s letter.

I have just returned from a two days’ visit to our beautiful campus. During
this time I had an opportunity to talk with many faculty members and students.
I came away convinced that now, more than at any other time in the history of
Washington and Lee, our Alma Mater needs our support. As alumni we are
bound to the University by the strongest of ties. We instinctively think of Wash-

ington and Lee as among the things in life most worth preserving.

In a few weeks you will receive a letter from your Class Agent whose name,
by the way, is listed on the inside cover of this magazine. I urge you to reply
to his letter promptly. Not only will your Class Agent appreciate your writing
him but your response will indicate to the administrative officers, to the faculty,
to the Fund workers, and to all others connected with the school that you do ap-
preciate what they are doing for us and for the perpetuation of Washington
and Lee.

The 1951 Alumni Fund was a great triumph for the class agent system and
the men who make it work. My most sincere thanks to all who have made this
possible.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Report of the 1951 Alumni Fund

A generous portion of this issue
of the Alumni Magazine is devoted
to details on the 1951 Alumni
Fund. Also, for the first time we
have tried to analyze our Fund
through the period of its existence,
1933-1951. I hope alumni will take
time to study the lists of contribu-
tors and the tables of statistics
which tell the full story. You will
notice that development has been
slow but that progress has been
steady. The $40,490.24 received
in 1951 exceeds by $12,000 any
previous year.

The Alumni Board, at its meet-
ing in June, decided that all money
received from the ’51 Fund should
be handed to the Treasurer of the
University and expended at the
direction of the University Board
of Trustees. The amount turned
over to the University this year
from the Alumni Fund equals in-
come on $1,000,000 of capital
funds. It is clear our Alumni Fund
is taking on increasing importance.
Last year it enabled the University
to operate effectively without a
deficit.

In spite of the progress we have
made, we are far behind other
colleges of similar size in annual
giving. The amount of money re-
ceived last year was most encour-
aging when we consider that only
1,958 alumni, out of our total of
10,327, contributed to the Fund.
You will note from our analysis

By Cy YouNG

Alumni Secretary

 

that a total of 5,468 alumni have
contributed to the Fund at one time
or another. At a minimum, 4,000
of this number should be respond-
ing annually. This is not too much
to expect—the percentage of givers
to many other college funds far
exceeds this number.

I want to pay real attention here
to the work of the agents and their
classes in recognition of how much
the work of these men has meant.
Not only did Charlie Gilmore ’39-A
lead all classes with his 93 con-
tributors, but this number broke
all records for the number of givers
to one class since our Fund began.
His class is a large one and when
he achieved a 34% response, he
almost doubled the average.

Paul Murphy 714-A_ led all
classes in the amount of money re-
ceived. In his total of $3,592, he
did receive one or two large gifts.
But the most amazing part of his
record is that 50% of his class con-
tributed. Elsewhere in this report
you will find the five classes lead-
ing in several categories. It is most
encouraging to see the distribution
in each of these listings. Phil Mur-
ray °10-A ranked his class fourth in
the amount of money received and
we find Joe Ellis ’43 third in the
number of contributors.

Last year 17 classes showed
more contributors than ever before
in the 19 years of our Fund his-
tory, and 49 classes had their best
year in money received.

I would like to say something
about each class agent, because
any credit for our results belongs
to them, but you will understand
that it cannot be fully said in a re-
port of this kind. They all did a
grand job and my experience in
working with this fine group was
most pleasant. May I here also in-
clude my thanks to the several
hundred alumni who have served in
the past as class agents. To them
must go a lot of credit for build-
ing the Fund on a firm foundation
without which the present struc-
ture could not exist.

The financial situation of the
University has not changed ma-
terially from last year and surveys
show that one-half of all our pri-
vate liberal arts institutions are now
operating in the red. Many of them
are dipping into their endowment
capital. We don’t want this to hap-
pen at Washington and Lee. The
best preventive we know of is con-
certed annual giving by the alumni
through the class agents. Early
in April you will receive a letter
from your class agent. He is ren-
dering an outstanding service and
he deserves a reply, with or with-
out a contribution. Our 1952 goal
is 2,500 contributors.

Student

It was the month of December.
It was cold and windy but sitting
in the stands of Wilson Field were
several hundred Washington and
Lee students and their dates. A
four ring circus was taking place
on the field. The Washington and
Lee band was parading and form-
ing figures. A Santa Claus was
giving out free cigarettes and sou-
venirs. A comical cross country
race was underway. A _ plane
roared overhead dropping leaflets
which missed the field by a full
mile. And, incidently, there was
also a football game—the annual
Washington and Lee “Corn Bowl.”

Each December twenty-five ex-
high school and would-be athletes
representing the Red Square fra-
ternities thaw out long unused and
undiscovered muscles, and meet
twenty-five once-a-year football
players representing the remainder
of the campus in as brutal a grid-
iron tussle as can be found in any
bowl. Varsity players coach the
two teams, nicknamed the “Ker-
nels” and the “Kobs.” Uniforms
are supplied by the athletic depart-
ment. This year the Red Square
“Kernels” outlasted the “Kobs,”
12 to 6.

The “Corn Bowl” is an annual
project of the Student War Mem-
orial Scholarship Fund Committee,
called SWMSFC for short, which
is one of the University’s newer
student organizations. It was
formed in February, 1948, when

Harold N. Hill, Jr., ’52

Fred Vinson, Jr., then Student
Body President, appointed William
Chipley to head up an organiza-
tion whose purpose was the raising
of money for a war memorial to
Washington and Lee Alumni killed
during World War II. It was de-
cided at this time that a scholarship
fund would be the most appropriate
memorial, as it would be more
lasting, more valuable, and more in
keeping with the wishes of those
being honored, than a monument.
A goal of $10,000 was set for the
fund raising committee, the inter-
est to be applied annually to the
tuition of some deserving student.
The money was to be raised
through various student activities
and projects, and through indivi-

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

 

Memorial Scholarship Fund

dual gifts from interested friends.
To date the organization has
cleared almost $7,000. Six thou-
sand five-hundred dollars has been
given to Mr. Mattingly, University
‘Treasurer, for investment at 4%,
and the remainder is in the hands of
the committee to be used for oper-
ating expenses and for financing of
future events.

This new organization, although
primarily a money raising one, has
proved to be one of the more worth-
while activities on campus. Under
the leadership of some of the more
able undergraduates the SW MSFC
has brought to the campus, humor,
an outlet for student expression,
and activities which have made W.
and L. campus life more well
rounded than before.

The “Corn Bowl” game, begun
in 1948, is undoubtedly the peak
production of the SWMSFC. But
it has sponsored innumerable and
varied projects. In 1948 it spon-
sored the first Southern Collegiate
Wrestling Beauty Contest in Do-
remus gymnasium. At intermission
of the Southern Conference wrest-
ling tournament, girls from nearby
colleges paraded before the stu-
dents. A ten cent donation to the
SWMSF gave a vote to the girl
of the student’s choice. Another
long remembered epoch was a
faculty-student baseball game in
1950. The faculty, believe it or
not, won the game. Several dances
have been sponsored by the Com-

23

mittee, including “Homecomings”
and a Cabaret dance in Lynchburg.
A book entitled So Youw’re Dating
a Mink, was written and published
by two students Dick Ballard and
Pat Warden, in the spring of 1950.
It is still selling to dates, visitors,
and parents, all proceeds going to
the fund. Prior to each dance set
members of the SWMSFC sell
flowers. Cigarette machines are
now located in fraternity houses,
under the sponsorship of the fund
raising committee. A horse show
has been held. During the Bicen-
tennial members addressed and
stamped 20,000 first day enve-
lopes. Proceeds went to the fund.
Expenses sometimes run two-thirds
of the gross profit, sometimes as
low as one-fifth.

Other organizations on campus
often help out. The proceeds from
the 1948 Homecomings Dance,
sponsored by Pi Alpha Nu, (hon-
orary sophomore fraternity) went
into the fund. Sigma Delta Chi’s
(honorary journalism fraternity)
“Varsity Show” was for the benefit
of the SWMSFC. The White
Friars, (another honorary sopho-
more organization) held a dance for
the fund.

Local merchants have taken an
interest in the memorial fund. The
plane mentioned earlier in the
article was financed by a local
clothing store. The book So Youw’re
Dating a Mink, was financed by
advertising sold to local mer-
chants. The flower shop gives a
special discount on flowers sold by
SWMSF Committee members.
Local merchants contributed the
gifts for a raffle.

The Committee perpetuates it-
self, choosing two or three soph-
omores each year. Thus the organ-
ization consists of a Chairman, a
senior, and seven or eight members.
It is termed an honorary position
and entails a great deal of hard
work as can be seen from the list
of projects entirely run and sup-
ported by this organization. Mem-
bers say it is a great deal of fun,
but sometimes not all play. For
instance there is the story of the

24

SWMSFC Chairman who was run-
ning a dance. All weekend he had
been worriedly taking care of little
details. His gorgeous date was be-
coming annoyed. Finally, when the
Chairman stopped dancing for a
moment to count heads and see
whether the dance was making or
losing money for the SWMSFC,
the young lady decided she’d had
enough. She walked off the floor
and the conscientious committee
chairman hasn’t seen her since.

Harold N. Hill, Jr., this year’s
chairman, has had an outstanding
year. To date the committee has
sponsored the Homecoming Dance,
the “Corn Bowl,” cigarette ma-
chines, flower sales, movie show-
ings, and a jazz concert (student
musicians). The future calls for
either a donkey or a faculty stu-
dent baseball game, a raffle, and a
talent show.

Occasionally members come up
with some amazing and imagina-
tive suggestions. Recent brain-
childs have included lady wrest-
lers, a big league ball game, and
the bringing of the Harlem Globe
Trotters or Lily Christine (of Cat
Girl fame) to Lexington.

However Chairman Hill says,
“We feel that the student should
be given something for his money,
but at the same time we prefer stu-
dent produced shows and projects.
Incidentally, we willingly accept
personal contributions, but we do
not solicit them.”

The fund is fast approaching
its goal. It is expected that the
$10,000 scholarship will be avail-
able in three more years. The stu-
dent applying for the scholarship
must be submitted to the commit-
tee for consideration by an under-
graduate or an alumnus who was
a student during the years of the
fund raising. The student must
meet Washington and Lee require-
ments as stated in the catalogue.
Final decision will be made by the
University committee on scholar-
ships. The scholarship may be re-
newed at the end of each under-
graduate year if the student’s
record has been satisfactory.

Football Nostalgia

W. H. Keister, °94, retired
superintendent of the Harrison-
burg, Virginia Public Schools, is
interested in finding out just when
and where the first football game
was played between the Univer-
sity of Virginia and Washington
and Lee.

He recalls that in 1890, his first
year at Washington and Lee, a
game was played on a field toward
the north-west end of the present
athletic field, which that year had
been planted in corn. The corn
had been removed and the stubs
of fodder had been rolled down
to avoid injuring the players.

Mr. Keister remembers the
game well and before the play had
proceeded long a University of
Virginia. man named Whitaker
seemed to be severely injured. He
was lying under the east goal and
writhed and rolled and groaned
and squirmed and seemed to be
suffering terribly. He was rubbed,
water poured on his face and much
attention given him. Finally, he
got up, limped around a good deal.
Play was resumed, the ball given
Whitaker, and he ran the entire
length of the field for a touchdown.
Mr. Keister has forgotten who
won the game, but he is sure
THEY did.

The next year the field was
much further back, near the woods
in the rear of the boom Hotel
DeHart (since destroyed by fire),
near the present residence of Dr.
George H. Denny. Mr. Keister
played in that game. The place
was well sodded but not level and
not fenced. A disturbance occurred
when a brakeman off a train stand-
ing in the C. & O station in-
sisted that he would not pay to
see the game. An effort was made
to put him out, but he put up a
fight and remained to see the
game. How dusty and full of corn
stalks was that field! The only
living member of this team, be-
sides himself, that Mr. Keister
knows of is Hiram Martz, 795, who

A New

Big news from the field of
sports at Washington and Lee this
winter was the resignation of Head
Football Coach George Barclay,
who returned to his alma mater,
North Carolina, and the appoint-
ment of Carl Wise, backfield coach
for the last six years, as head tutor.

Wise came to Washington and
Lee as head basketball coach and
backfield coach for Art Lewis in
1946. He was instrumental in de-
veloping the General’s fast-open-
ing T-formation play under Lewis
for three years. When Lewis re-
signed to accompany VMI’s Slick
Morton to Mississippi State in
1949, Barclay, tagged from Mary-
land where he was line coach,
elected to retain the energetic Carl
as backfield coach and a collabor-
ating expert in the T-formation.

The new head coach was born in
Altamont, N. C., in 1916, and at-
tended Crossnore High School. He
was graduated from King College
in Bristol, Tenn., in 1937, where
he played football and basketball
under the late W. S. “Pedie” Jack-
son. He began his long coaching
career in 1937 at Newland, N. C.
high school when he was only 20
years old. The next six years saw
high school coaching assignments
at Gate City and Covington, Va.

Wise entered the Navy in 1942,
served as backfield coach for
the undefeated 1943 Bainbridge,
Md., Navy football team that in-
cluded several famous pro-stars
and an 18-year-old youngster
named Charlie Justice.

In 1945, after leaving the Navy,
Wise was an assistant and scout
for George Munger at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. He left
there to join Lewis at Washington
and Lee.

Wise is married to the former
Jody Tate of Gate City.

The 35-year-old coach is popu-
lar with players, students, and the
administration. Early reports from

 

Carl Wise
New Head Football Coach

spring football practice indicate a
1952 edition of the Big Blue equal
to, if not better than, the ’51 team.
The Barclay coached Generals
had a three year record of 17 wins,
11 losses, and one tie for a .607
average. During his regime Wash-
ington and Lee won the Southern
Conference championship in 1950,
and played in their first bowl game
in history, the Gator Bowl.
Barclay brought big time foot-
ball to Lexington for the first time,
and was highly thought of by the
University. The student news-
paper, The Ring-tum Phi, printed
a glowing tribute to Coach Bar-
clay upon the announcement that
he had accepted another position,
saying in part, “... A great man
as well as a great football player
and coach will be leaving us soon,
but his three years at Washington
and Lee will long be remembered
by the thousands of students and
friends who know and _ respect

him.”

high scoring forward, with a total

MEMPHIS

On Tuesday, January 22, the

Memphis for Washington and Lee
Alumni, fathers of students, and
friends of the University, in the
Mid-South area. The group met
at 5:30 for cocktails and a fellow-
ship hour, and at 7:00 o’clock a
buffet dinner was served to the
ninety-five persons attending.

After the meal, Allen Morgan,
29, acted as toastmaster, welcom-
ing the out-of-town guests and

non-alumni members. A nominat-
ing committee, composed of Stew-
art Buxton, ’36, and L. V. (Jimmy)
Butler, °37, presented a slate of
candidates for the Alumni Asso-
ciation officers for 1952, and as
there were no nominations from
the floor, the men nominated were

Football Nostalgia
(Continued from page 24)
lives near New Market, Virginia.

Mr. Keister does not recall that
there were other football fields,
but does remember playing one
season on the old Fair Grounds,
south east of Lexington. Other
athletic events were held there and
he was the winner in some of the
contests.

During those years there were
games with V. M. I. In one of these
games Mr. Keister played against
a cadet named Poindexter, who
was called “OLD SOW” and he
can still hear them yelling “Root
him Old Sow.” In this game he
broke a knuckle on his right hand,
which crippled his right arm for
life. He recalls playing a game
with Princeton on the V. M. I. Pa-
rade Grounds and remembers them
as the most gentlemanly team he
ever played against.

We quote from Mr. Keister’s
letter:

“This, as you observe, is going
back 61 years, and at my age, 86,
plus nearly four months, my mem-
ory is only fairly accurate. Even
yet, however, I follow every game
and rejoice with you when you win
and weep with you when you lose.
... After all the years, I am eternal-
ly grateful for what W. and L. did
for me and has meant to me; it not
only does FOR you, but does IN
you that which is helpful every
day of your life.”
