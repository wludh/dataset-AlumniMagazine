You, Too, Can Be First in Line. . .

O HAVE THE VERY BEST time, “Be

first in line....’’ A great many
Washington and Lee alumni and
their wives and families have al-
ready indicated their plans to be
on the campus June 11, 12 and 18
for the Reunion of All Classes. Be-
ginning with the Bi-Centennial in
1949, the University has maintain-
ed a policy of conducting a reunion
of all classes every five years. The af-
fair in June, 1954, was such a tre-
mendous success and so well attend-
ed that everyone has been eagerly
awaiting this coming June of 1959.
Because of limited hotel space and
the many varied functions of both
Washington and Lee University
and VMI during the month of May
and the graduation exercises, the
alumni office is obliged to schedule
the Reunion of All Classes follow-
ing the graduation exercises of both
schools. All surrounding hotels and
motels have been reserved for this
occasion, and there is the possibility
of using one of the University
dormitories.

Included in the program for the
reunion will be special banquets
and attractions for the twenty-fifth,
fortieth and fiftieth anniversary
classes. ‘These classes, which norm-
ally hold their individual anniver-
sary reunions the middle of May
in previous years, have enthusias-
tically joined forces with the gen-
eral reunion to make this June,
1959, one of the largest affairs in
the University’s history. In view
of the announced retirement of
Dr. Francis P. Gaines as president
of Washington and Lee University,

2

many alumni are returning as a
tribute to him. Dr. Gaines is
pleased to have this opportunity to
see again so many of the alumni
and friends before his retirement.
It is also evident from the cam-
paign being carried forth by the
University Development Program
that great strides will be taken by
Washington and Lee University in
the immediate future, and the com-
ments from those returning for the
reunion indicate a tremendous in-
terest in these plans. New construc-
tion and buildings are now taking
place at the University and many
more are in the planning stage. The
returning alumni will be interest-
ed in seeing these new facets of the
University.

The program as outlined is not
intended necessarily as a punch
card time schedule. The activities
are varied, and it is expected that
all alumni of the various age
groups will find interesting and

 

entertaining events. Because of lim-
ited eating facilities in Lexington,
Thursday, June 11 will feature a
“dutch” box lunch which is strict-
ly voluntary. It will be the first
chance for a great many alumni to
get together in many years and this
function was considered wise in
order to ease the situation on the
local restaurants. This will precede
a panel discussion Thursday after-
noon on the state of the University
at which time the Deans of the
various colleges, together with
other administrative officials, will
discuss the present situation and
future plans as related to their in-
dividual fields.

The principal speaker at the re-
union convocation on Friday, June
12, will be Mr. Stuart Saunders of
Roanoke, Virginia. Mr. Saunders is
president of the Norfolk and West-
ern Railway Company and is chair-
man of the Virginia Foundation
for Independent Colleges. Mr.
Saunders has long been a promin-
ent figure in the railroad and busi-
ness circles. As chairman of the
Virginia Foundation for Indepen-
dent Colleges, Mr. Saunders is also
eminently qualified to discuss the
problems and _ responsibilities of
small independent colleges and
universities such as Washington
and Lee. His message to the return-
ing alumni will be both challeng-
ing and entertaining.

The golf tournament Friday af-
ternoon will be capped by a recep-
tion given by the Alumni Associa-
tion in honor of Dr. and Mrs.

The new dormitory for students has been named Baker Hall, for Newron D. BAKER, ‘94, who was Secretary of War during World
War I. It is in the process of getting a covered walkway (foreground) to the new dining Hall. The architecture of this building and the
dormitory for law students is similar to that of the freshman dorm, which is just across the street. The dining hall was named Evans
Hall, in honor of a great benefactor, Letitia PATE Evans, who lefi considerable funds in trust for the use of Washington and Lee.

University Commons

Now Almost Completed

LUMNI RETURNING to Washing-
A ton and Lee June 11-13 for
the General Reunion will be eager
to tour the four new University
buildings, now rapidly nearing
completion.

‘The commons was begun in No-
vember, 1957, and includes an im-
posing University dining hall, two
student dormitories, and a_ book-
store-snackbar, thus fulfilling long-
standing needs on campus.

Graduates who won't be in Lex-

ington to view the new buildings
or the dedication of Evans dining
hall can see pictures of the finished
products in the next issue of this
magazine.

Evans dining hall, with its hand-
some school seal high above the
five vertical front windows, will
accommodate 495 persons under
normal seating arrangements, and
650 at banquets. It contains a main
dining hall, three small dining

rooms, kitchens, lounges, coat

rooms, and offices for supervisory
personnel. When it goes into active
use next September, it will solve a
large number of eating problems in
Lexington—for students who have
switched from restaurant to restau-
rant uptown; for campus groups
which have wanted to have private
dinners and haven’t had the place
or cash to stage what was desired.
For fraternities, it will create prob-
lems, because all freshmen will be
required to eat at the University

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

dining hall, instead of paying board
bills to fraternity houses.

The two dormitories will pro-
vide living quarters for about 40
men in each unit. One building
will be occupied by Law School
students; and the other by academ-
ic upperclassmen.

The bookstore-snackbar, attached
to the Lee street side of the Stu-
dent Union Building, is a_two-
story structure designed to furnish
space and facilities for functions
formerly crammed into one small
and inadequate building.

All work on the new project is
supposed to be completed by July
15, including landscaping of the
grounds.

Site of the project is the spacious
grounds where once stood the resi-
dence of the family of the late Dr.
John Preston, Presbyterian min-
ister here. A number of the large
boxwood and shrubs which stood
on the property were “heeled-in”
behind Doremus gymnasium when
the excavation work began, and
they will be moved back to en-
hance the grounds. Other trans-
plants include a large and ancient
“white fringe tree,” or “mountain
ash’ which the Prestons once en-
joyed, and two large specimens of
American tree box which formerly
guarded the Preston walkway.

The whole project is located on
Washington street, directly across
from the President’s Home, and on
Lee avenue. Lee avenue was wid-
ened by eight feet this spring, and
Washington will also gain four feet
more of roadway. ‘This was done
because of expected increase in
trafic on the two narrow Lex-
ington streets.

The building project has been
carried out by the English Con-
struction company of Altavista,
Virginia, at a cost of around
$1,500,000. Plans of the work were
prepared by Clark, Nexsen and
Owen, Architects, of Lynchburg,
Virginia.

ae Dr. FRANCIS P. GAINES, who will
retire as president of Washington
and Lee in the fall, has been lauded
by the Governor of Virginia for his
long years of service to education.
Governor J. Lindsay Almond
praised Dr. Gaines as “‘one who
has followed in the footsteps, and
reflected the glory” of General
Robert E. Lee. He said he wished
to “express my own feeling of de-
votion ... and that of the people of
Virginia” to Dr. Gaines for his
service.

Washington and Lee, the chief
executive continued, has left its 1m-
print on the state of Virginia,
America, and the world.

ge UNIVERSITY STUDENTS and V.M.I.
cadets alike will benefit from a
joint program by the two colleges
to provide further instruction in
the Russian language.

The program, to start in Septem-
ber, calls for elementary Russian to
be offered at one institution, and

8

intermediate Russian at the other,
on a two-year rotating basis. During
the first two years, the beginning
course will be given by Washing-
ton and Lee, and intermediate
work by V.M.I. Both courses are
open for full credit to students of
either college.

At the present time, five Wash-
ington and Lee students are en-
rolled in elementary Russian under
Dr. William W. Pusey. At V.M.L.,
two cadets are studying Russian
under Colonel Albert L. Lancaster.

‘The new program will eliminate
duplication, and offer the oppor-
tunity for more intensive training
than previously available at either
institution in a language whose
importance is steadly increasing in
scientific and political matters.

mw PARTICIPATING IN a_ National
Science Foundation study group
this summer will be Dr. J. Keith
Shillington, assistant professor of
chemistry. He will join thirty-nine

other college teachers in a six-week
study of the latest developments in
chemistry. ‘The course will be held
at the University of North Carolina
from June 8 to July 17. A National
Science Foundation grant of
$52,800 is supporting the event.

During the same period, Dr. Le-
land W. McCloud, associate profes-
sor of economics, will study on-the-
spot operations of the Virginia
Electric and Power Company in
Richmond. His special fellowship is
made available by the power com-

EDITING THE CALYX Is getting to
be something of a family tradition
for the Ladd boys from Mobile,
Alabama. Edward B. Ladd, a soph-
omore this year, was named by the
Publications Board in March as

editor of the yearbook for 1960.
His older brother, Russell, ’57, was
editor of the Calyx in 1956.

e C. Royce Houcu, III, of Wash-
ington, D.C. has been named vale-
dictorian of the class of 1959 by
the Washington and Lee faculty.

Faculty affirmation of his choice
as valedictorian was based on a
four-year academic record of 2.857
of a possible 3.0 grade point ratio.
This means Hough has done “A”
work in 96 semester hours, and “B”
work in only 16. He has received
no grade lower than B in the seven
semesters he has completed.

Hough, who is 21, is president of
the student body. In four years at
Washington and Lee, he has achiev-
ed virtually every significant honor
an undergraduate can receive.

An honor graduate of Washing-
ton’s Western High School, Hough
won the Washington and Lee inter-
fraternity council’s award as the
outstanding member of his class as
a freshman. The next year he was

 

Student body president RoycE HouGH
will deliver the valedictory this year.

honored by Phi Beta Kappa as the
school’s top sophomore in academ-
ic standing, and as a junior he was
elected to membership in the na-
tional honorary scholastic fratern-
ity.

In elections held last spring, he
was chosen overwhelmingly to serve
as president of the student body.
He is a member of the Washington
and Lee chapter of Beta Gamma
Sigma, commerce fraternity, and is
an officer in the university's ROTC
unit. He will be commissioned a
second lieutenant in the Army re-
serve upon graduation. He is a
varsity letterman in lacrosse, and he
served as president of the school’s
Opening Dances.

ANOTHER NATIONAL honor has
come to a Washington and Lee
student. Charles W. Springer, a
junior from Des Moines, Iowa, has
been named winner of the nation-
wide essay contest on international
relations.

His entry, “Collective Security
in Southeast Asia,” based on a
study of the Southeast Asia Treaty
Organization (SEATO), — was
judged best in the contest spon-
sored by the National Association
of International Relations Clubs.

its annual senior banquet May 6
at the Natural Bridge hotel.

Guests were members of the grad-
uating classes of academic and law
schools of June, 1959, and Febru-
ary, 1960.

The senior banquet is held an-
nually to organize graduates into

the work of the alumni association.

= A 19-YEAR-OLD student from Beav-
er Dam, Virginia, has been named
the school’s “outstanding  fresh-
man” by the Interfraternity Coun-
cil.

He is Rosewell Page, III, a gradu-
ate of St. Christopher’s school in
Richmond. His selection was based
on all-round excellence. He holds
a Robert E. Lee Scholarship, and
was elected to Phi Eta Sigma, na-
tional freshman scholastic honor
group. He has been co-captain of

nessee.

» A WASHINGTON AND LEE senior,
junior, and 1958 graduate have
been awarded coveted fellowships
by the Woodrow Wilson National
Fellowship Foundation.

Honored were senior Werner J.
Deiman, Hempstead, New York;
junior Thomas W. Wieting, Owens-
boro, Kentucky; and Lewis G.
John, °58, Cortland, New York.

They are among 1,200 outstand-
ing American and Canadian stu-
dents selected as Woodrow Wilson
Fellows. The program’s purpose is
to encourage promising young
scholars to enter the teaching field.

Deiman plans to study English
literature at Yale University next
year. Wieting, one of only a select
few college juniors receiving an
award, will do graduate work in
mathematics at a university he will
will determine later.

John was awarded a Wilson fel-
lowship last year, but declined in
order to accept a Fulbright fellow-
ship for study at the University of
Edinburgh in Scotland. He applied
again this year successfully.

e ALTHOUGH WASHINGTON = and
Lee’s Moot Court team did not
win or place this year in the na-
tional finals in New York City in
December, the University could
claim a little reflected glory from
the team which did triumph.

One of the members of the win-
ning University of Texas team was
Alfred H. Ebert, Jr., who graduated
magna cum laude from Washing-
ton and Lee in 1950, with a B.S.
degree in Commerce.

Alfred was graduated with hon-
ors in February from the Texas
Law School, and on April 1, be-
came associated with the law firm
of Andrews, Kurth, Campbell, and
Bradley in Houston, Texas.

While at the University of ‘Texas,
he was on the Honor Roll, and
and president of Phi Delta frater-
nity.

# F. WILLIAM LING, ’53, interme-
diate from Roanoke, Virginia, was
elected president of the Student
Bar Association in April. An out-
standing student, Ling is a mem-
ber of Phi Beta Kappa and holds a
Menckemeller Scholarship. He
served in the armed forces from
1953-56, and last year, won a Ful-
bright grant to study in Germany.
There he lectured German stu-
dents on American government. He
plans to return to Europe this sum-
mer and travel in the Soviet Union
under a grant from the Institute
of International Education.

He has held departmental schol-
arships in Religion and Greek, and
has served as student assistant in
the English and German depart-
ments. He is currently acting as a
tutor for the English department.

He has been a member of the
Burks Competition Committee, a
contributor to the Law Review,

and was winner of the Freshman
Oral Competition.

Other officers of the Student Bar
are: vice-president, Bayles Mack,
Fort Mill, South Carolina; secre-
tary, Joseph L. Lyle, Jr., Virginia
Beach, Virginia; and treasurer, Jer-
ry A. Susskind, Jackson, Michigan.

a THe Mock TRIAL this year took
on a definite flavor of realism, when
two students, posing as ex-convicts,
“robbed” the Co-op store on the
night of February 12. In the ex-
citement, a gun held by one of the
convicts went off and “fatally”
wounded a student. The two men
got away, but were subsequently
apprehended.

Later, in a three-hour trial in
the Court of Tucker Hall, the de-
fense attorneys succeeded in gain-
ing an acquittal for the killers. The
turning point came when two wit-
nesses for the defense testified they
saw the accused men having a beer
at Snookie’s Lunch approximately
five minutes after the alleged shoot-
ing took place. Defense attorneys
pointed out the ridiculous nature
of the assumption that the two men
would commit murder, and then
dash three city blocks to quaff a
brew. Coupled with conflicting tes-
timony of other witnesses, the
Commonwealth’s case was broken.

Professor Charles V. Laughlin
presided as judge.

es FRESHMAN LAW STUDENT William
C. Miller, from Ponte Vedra Beach,
Florida, has been awarded a Ful-
bright fellowship for graduate
work in Europe next year. He will

Another Washington and Lee
student, senior John A. Paul of
Harrisonburg, Virginia, received a
Fulbright “travel grant’’ for use in
France next year for physics study,
but Paul is declining the award be-
cause of a conflict in plans.

HE ELEVENTH ANNUAL ‘Tucker
Law Lectures brought back to
the campus a number of former law
students on May 1 and 2. Speaker
this year was Whitney North Sey-
mour, president-elect of the Ameri-
can Bar Association, and a partner
in the New York firm of Simpson,
Thatcher, and Bartlett since 1929.
His subject was, “Horizons for
the Young Lawyer,” and he told his
student audience that they face new
challenges to make greater contri-
butions to American Life. Among
new areas where the legal profes-
sion can serve, he lsted parental
counseling to forestall juvenile de-
linquency, study of and interest in
American history, and promotion
of the dignity and prestige of the
American judicial system.

At the end of the first lecture, the
Staples Chapter of Phi alpha Delta
legal fraternity presented a portrait
of Dean Clayton E. Williams, ‘12,
to the University. The portrait,

Washington and Lee

Sets Up Publications Fund

T HAPPENS FAIRLY often. John Q.
Professor, on dozens of college
faculties throughout the nation, has
written a very scholarly treatise
which he thinks should be pub-
lished in book form.

He tries several publishers and
gets substantially the same answer
from all: rising costs in the publish-
ing industry have forced presses to
insist that either the author or his
college partially subsidize the vol-
ume’s publication.

This situation generally has
tended to discourage erudite writ-
ing among professors.

Washington and Lee, realizing
this situation, has moved to provide
a special publications fund to help
its professors who wish to publish
books. And Dean Leon F. Sensa-
baugh says the plan is expected to
give new impetus to_ scholarly
writing by faculty members.

According to Dean Sensabaugh,
the publishing situation in scholar-

ly books is almost the reverse of
that in textbook publishing. Almost
any textbook written by a_ pro-
fessor will find a willing commer-
cial publisher. But the learned vol-
ume, treating special subjects and
limited in its appeal, is now gen-
erally accepted only by the var-
ious university-sponsored _ presses
throughout the country.

And before a professor’s book is
accepted, he must be willing to help
pay for publication, either out of

Professor Jenks, hard at
work on his new book.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

his own pocket or with funds pro-
vided by his college.

While publication costs vary in
special instances, a book of about
275 pages requires approximately
$5,000 to put 1,200 copies into
print.

Washington and Lee’s publica-
tion fund will make use of money
available in the university’s John
M. Glenn Fund, a source of assist-
ance to professors conducting study
and research. A portion of the
Glenn money available each year
will be set aside for the publication
fund, for three years, after which
it is hoped the University can ap-
propriate independent funds for
publication. In addition, a surplus
fund of Glenn money has been
transferred to the fund.

President Francis P. Gaines has
appointed an editorial board of six
faculty members and Dean Sensa-
baugh to review manuscripts pre-
sented by faculty applicants. This
board will make recommendations
to the president’s faculty advisory
committee, which is to administer
the publication money. On _ the
board are Dr. James G. Leyburn,
sociology; Dr. A. Ross Borden, Jr.,
English; Dr. Lomas Barrett, Ro-
mance languages; W. J. Ritz, °38,
law; Dr. Lewis K. Johnson, com-
merce and Dr. Esmarch S. Gilreath,
chemistry.

IRST TO DRAW benefits from the
Pes fund is Dr. William A.
Jenks, ’39, professor of history. His
278-page book, “Hitler’s Vienna:
1907-1913," has been accepted by
the Columbia University Press for
publication early next year, with
the major portion of the cost of
publication coming from its res-
sources, and Washington and Lee
contributing the rest.

Dr. Jenks’ new book is the second
handled for him by the New York
firm. When his thesis for his Ph.D.
was published in 1950, Columbia
University Press did the job.

He began work on his new book

NOTICE TO ALUMNI

The nominating committee, appointed by the President of the

in 1952, with Washington and Lee
providing limited financial assist-
an for his research through Carne-
gie Foundation funds then avail-
able. In 1954-55 he spent the entire
year in Vienna on a Fulbright Fel-
lowship, working primarily at the
University of Vienna Library.

Generally, his book discusses po-
litical, social and intellectual cur-
rents prevalent in the Austrian cap-
ital when Adolph Hitler was liv-
ing there during his early twenties.
In Hitler’s autobiographical “Mein
Kampf,” he says this was his “‘for-
mative period,” and that all his
major ideas developed during this
time.

For this reason, Dr. Jenks thinks
the influences which Hitler came
under are of great importance and
significance to an understanding of
the man who brought about World
War II.

Libraries and scholars will be the
principal purchasers of this book,
Dr. Jenks points out, and he is
hopeful that the book will sell well.
Even so, he will not likely reap per-
sonal gains, for should there be
profits, they will be returned to the
publications fund until the Uni-
versity’s share in the subsidy has
been repaid.

Dr. Jenks has been a member of
the history department since 1946.
He has been a full professor since

1956.

# WASHINGTON AND LEE’s well-bal-
anced golf team captured the state
intercollegiate championship, and
javelin thrower Karl Rohnke led
a resurgence in track and _ field
interest to highlight a better-than-
average spring sports season.

Coach Cy Twombly’s ever-strong
golfers swept through nine dual
matches without defeat, before
dropping two contests of the year
to Richmond and Virginia. But in
the State Intercollegiate Tourna-
ment at Hot Springs, the Generals
rebounded to take the team trophy
by a nine stroke margin over de-
fending champion Virginia.

Captain Ned Baber of Lynch-
burg was consistently medalist for
the Generals, but it was the near-
equal balance of Coach ‘Twombly’s
next seven men _ that provided
Washington and Lee with one of
its best golf teams in history.

On Wilson Field, a new, re-vital-
ized track and field squad turned
in a dual meet record of six wins
and two losses. Rohnke, one of the
greatest athletes ever to attend
Washington and Lee, established
a new school javelin mark of 200
feet, 10 1/2 inches, taking second
place in the Penn Relays with
the record-shattering throw. Earlier
in the season, he had bested his
old record of 189 feet with a Wilson
Field effort of 198-11. Just a junior,
Rohnke will captain the track team
next year for the third consecutive
season. Returning are a host of
young athletes who contributed to
Coach Norm Lord’s fine season this
year as freshmen and sophomores.

The tennis team, under the
coaching of alumni secretary Bill
Washburn, started slowly but gath-
ered momentum in the late season
to compile a 9-3 record, with one
match left—with Virginia—at press
time. Mauricio Glauser and Bill
McWilliams were steady winners.

Coach Bob McHenry’s rebuilt

16

lacrosse team—sorely missing All-
American goalie Jim Lewis and
several other departed stars—has
surprised with a creditable 4-5, sea-
son and a chance to break even
for the year if they can down Vir-
ginia in their 1959 finale. Play by
juniors Skip Horst and Jay Stull
has marked them for possible 1960
All-American honors.

In other lacrosse news, a com-
bined team of Washington and
Lee and University of Virginia
players has been invited to partici-
pate in the 1959 Australian La-
crosse Carnival in Melbourne. Each
school will contribute ten men to
the combined squad. Once in Aus-
tralia, the team will be the guests
of the Australian Lacrosse Council.
Fund-raising activities are under-
way now to help transport the team
“Down Under” this summer.

Mosby G. Perrow, ’30
Heads Commission

TATE SENATOR PERROW was chair-
S man of a _ pivotal legislative
commission at a crucial point, so
far as race relations are concerned,
in the history of Virginia. The
United States Supreme Court’s de-
cision in Brown v. Board of Educa-
tion ended the era of separate, and
theoretically equal, educational fa-
cilities for the white and negro
races. Virginia’s response to the
Supreme Court decision was mas-
sive resistance. The massive resist-
ance program, embodied in several
acts of the regular and special ses-
sions of the Virginia legislature, fell
by the wayside as the result of two
decisions handed down on the same
day. One was the ruling by the Vir-
ginia Supreme Court of Appeals
that the massive resistance laws
were invalid on state constitutional
grounds. A United States District
court held that those statutes did
not comply with the United States
Supreme Court decisions. Virginia

met the void created by these de-
cisions by an immediate and tem-
porary repealing of all compulsory
education laws. A legislative com-
mission, headed by Senator Perrow,
was appointed to study the prob-
lem and to recommend a perman-
ent solution.

The Perrow Commission tackled
an extremely difficult problem. It
had to guide a course between the

Sheriff F. P. Gaines
Gets New Duties

FTER THIRTY-TWO YEARS as a cCol-

lege president, Dr. Francis

P. Gaines has taken on duties of
an entirely different nature.

He is now honorary sheriff of
Duval county, Florida.

‘They haven't found it necessary
to call on me yet, but I’m ready,”
President Gaines declared.

He recently traveled to Jackson-
ville, Florida, for speaking engage-
ments at the Timuquana Club, the
Newcomen Society, and at the
George Washington Hotel. While
there, Duval county’s sheriff Dale
Carson appointed him honorary
sheriff.

Although he is planning to ex-
ecute his duties as sheriff consci-
entiously, Dr. Gaines said he would
not wear a badge or uniform. With
a broad grin, he asserted, “I think
I’m a plainclothesman.”

He says he is not planning to
neglect any duties attendant with
his job. “I’m keeping my eye on
the boys in the college from Jack-
sonville,” he added.

He doesn’t plan to carry a wea-
pon. In the time of need, he said,
he would have to rely upon his
letter opener—a replica of a Ve-
netian dagger, supposedly execut-
ed originally by Cellini.

Besides his law enforcement job,
Sheriff Gaines is also an honorary
State Senator of _Lowvisiana: Sim
alumni are members of the Senate,
and named him to the legislative
post in 1958.

Dr. Gaines, who will retire next
fall as president, after 29 years on
the job, is planning to build a
small home in Lexington at the
corner of Washington and Estil
streets across the street from the
faculty apartments. Dr. and Mrs.
Gaines also plan to spend some of
their time at their country home,
‘“Penrobin.”’

McWankE, who helped establish the gradu-
ate school of business administration there
in 1955. President Colgate Darden, Jr. ini-

sity authorities hope the fund can be
built up to a six-figure amount, and that
income from it can be used for the school.
Mr. McWane, a Lynchburg, Virginia, in-
dustrialist, helped build a million-dollar
endowment fund for the graduate schooi,
and a student loan fund of more than
$100,000. Mr. McWane died of a_ heart
