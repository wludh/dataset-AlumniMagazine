1950-1960

O AN INSTITUTION with a two hundred and eleven-
Loe history, a single decade is but a minute part
of the whole.

But the ten years just past were something spe-
cial...something noteworthy ...and altogether, one
of the most significant decades in its existence. Such
a decade calls for a review on these pages.

During the 1950's, the face of Washington and Lee
was changing. As at other American colleges and
universities, stepped-up emphasis on education and
the proper facilities brought about new buildings, new
equipment, new methods of teaching. The changing
face at Washington and Lee also involved men of ded-
icated service, who stepped down to make way for new
leaders.

Growth and progress were noted in the University’s
expanding national stature as an educational institu-
tion, in improvement of salaries for faculty and also
of scholarships for students, and in its comprehensive
planning for the future. And last but hardly least, its
resources were increased substantially through gener-
ous support from alumni, parents, friends, founda-
tions, and industries.

FAMILIAR FACES GONE

After heading the University for twenty-nine years,
Dr. Francis P. Gaines retired, and a new president, Dr.
Fred Carrington Cole, took over in September, 1959.
Dr. Leon F. Sensabaugh was named Dean of the Uni-
versity in 1955, succeeding Dr. James G. Leyburn, who
had held the job since 1947, and who wanted to go
back to teaching. “Captain Dick” Smith, athletic di-
rector since 1923, retired in 1955; for twenty-nine
years he was also coach of the Generals’ baseball team.
In 1958, one of the University’s most beloved figures,
alumni secretary Harry K. “Cy” Young, retired after
twenty-nine years of service, to be succeeded by Wil-
liam C. Washburn, ’40.

The Grim Reaper also removed a dozen of Wash-
ington and Lee’s well-known individuals. They were:
Dr. Henry Louis Smith, in 1951, president from 1912-
29; John Higgins Williams, ’24, in 1954, for twenty-
six years a political science teacher; Thomas E. Loth-

—the decade in review

ery, Jr., in 1954, professor of physics for sixteen years;
Dr. George Hutcheson Denny in 1955, president, 1901-
11; Dr. Glover D. Hancock in 1955, dean of the school
of commerce and administration, 1919-49; Dr. James
Lewis Howe, in 1955 at the age of 96, professor of
chemistry from 1894 until 1938; Dr. Livingston W.
Smith, ’96, in 1956, head of the math department from
1906-47; Dr. Marcellus H. Stow, in 1957, for thirty
years a geology professor and department head; Dr.
Merton O. Phillips in 1958, professor of economics for
thirty years; Dr. Walter A. Flick, “24, in 1958, thirty-

 

One of the most significant changes in the decade was the succession of DR. FRED CAR-
INGTON Co LE, left, to Dr. FRANcIs P. GAINes as president of Washington and Lee. Dr.
Gatnes has been named Chancellor of the University. The inauguration of DR. COLE as
thirteenth president will take place on May 7, 1960, in ceremonies on the front campus.

WINTER 1960

four years as teacher, and head of the department of
education and psychology; Dr. Henry V. Shelley in
1959, thirty-two years as professor of ancient languages;
and Dr. George H. Foster, 34, in 1959, professor of
English for twelve years, and head of the department
of comparative literature.

CAMPUS CHANGES

Changes came to the campus through the addition
of new buildings. In 1955, Jessie Ball duPont Hall,
a much-needed classroom building
with a special Fine Arts wing, was
placed in service. In 1959, the
University completed a $1,500,000
construction project which includ-
ed Letitia Pate Evans Dining Hall,
John W. Davis Dormitory for law
students, Newton D. Baker Dormi-
tory for upperclassmen, and a new
supply store and snack bar.

Throughout the decade, student
enrollment was maintained at the
1,000-1,100 level, although applica-
tions for admission showed steady
increases each year. No significant
increase in future enrollment is
now anticipated by officials.

GENEROUS SUPPORT

During the ten-year _ period,
Washington and Lee drew support
from alumni, parents, industry, and
friends. The annual Alumni Fund
went from $28,610 in 1950 to a
record high of $113,681 in the year
1958. The newly-established Par-
ents’ Fund reached $111,839 in its
first three years of operation.

The University built up its en-
dowment from $5,452,670 to $14,-
822,000 during the.decade.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 

The school was among many American colleges
whose faculty salary level was helped by the Ford
Foundation’s large grants in 1955. Various other foun-
dations, many established by American business and
industry, aided Washington and Lee during the 1950's,
and the University has received continuing and _ in-
creasing annual support from the gifts of Virginia busi-
ness and industry to the Virginia Foundation for In-
dependent Colleges, organized in 1953. Large bene-
factions have also come from individuals. One of the
largest single gifts, from an anonymous donor, founded
the Robert E. Lee Scholarships for exceptionally quali-
fied young men.

Scholarship aid to students rose significantly. In
the 1949-50 session, aid to students totaled $52,530.
In 1959, undergraduates shared in $155,115 of assist-
ance, most of it from endowed and University-adminis-
tered scholarships. Next year, the college will use
the first funds of a three-year $50,000 grant from the
George F. Baker Trust of New York, further enrich-
ing its scholarship program.

MERIT RECOGNIZED

Progress as an educational institution was reflected
in a nationwide survey among educators conducted
by the Chicago Tribune in 1957, which listed Wash-
ington and Lee as one of the “ten best’’ men’s colleges
in America—a listing arrived at only after multiple
studies in depth, and the compilation of the evalua-
tions of higher education’s most informed men.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

 

This picture of faculty and staff members with twenty-five or more years of service to the University was taken in February, 1958. Since
it appeared in the Alumni Magazine, three of the number have died, three are retired, and one has announced his retirement in June.
These dedicated and loyal men gave more than 864 years of their lives in service to Washington and Lee University.

NON INCAUTUS FUTURI

Concern for the future of the institution, the areas
of its needs and direction of its growth culminated in
1953, when Washington and Lee undertook a com-
prehensive development program. A thorough self-
study was made, and the University’s short- and long-
range needs were defined, priorities were established
and ways of achieving its goals were recommended.

Part of this program is now underway in the
$2,000,000 campaign to raise funds for new facilities
in science and journalism. Now in its second year, the
fund is rapidly approaching its goal. Preliminary plans
call for new buildings for geology-biology and physics,
additions to existing chemistry facilities, renovation of
the existing psysics building for journalism and _ pre-
engineering, plus a new maintenance center.

DECADE’S HIGHLIGHTS

There were other significant events during the
1950's. Among them were:

Establishment in 1951, during Korean War years,
of a United States Army Reserve Officers Training
Corps program.

A change in the athletic program from one of sub-
sidization to non-subsidization in 1954, just three
years after Washington and Lee’s football team played
in the ’Gator Bowl on January 1, 1951, In abandoning
so-called “big-time” athletics, Washington and Lee
sought to establish a more harmonious relationship be-

WINTER 1960

tween intercollegiate sports and its academic aspira-
tions.

The enrichment of McCormick Library’s holdings,
through a grant of $25,000 in 1958 from General Foods
Corporation.

The semester-long visit in 1958 of famed British
historian Arnold J. Toynbee as a visiting scholar-in-

residence, and his series of fifteen public lectures in
Lee Chapel.

The national honors, officers, fellowships, and
grants bestowed upon faculty members by foundations,
learned societies, and various levels of government; the
competitive scholarships and fellowships won by stu-
dents for advanced study in this country and abroad,
including two Rhodes scholarships.

NOW, FOR THE NEXT ONE...

With the advent of the 1960’s, Washington and Lee
is facing with other colleges the growing problems of
enrollment pressures, the shorter supply of qualified
teachers, ways to increase faculty salaries, avenues to
more scholarship assistance for worthy students, and
the tricky problem of obtaining the facilities necessary
for keeping pace with modern-day education.

With a proud glance behind at the goals already at-
tained, Washington and Lee moves on to a new dec-
ade, with implicit faith in the future, and in those
who love the University, toward its aim of a more com-
plete liberal arts education for the nation’s young
men.

Student Politicians Hustling

for Democratic Mock Convention

THE TWELFTH quadrennial mock
‘| political convention will be
held by students of Washington
and Lee on May g and 3. Tradi-
tionally held for the party out of
power, this year’s Democratic con-
vention promises to be a lively one,
with the usual cigar-smoking stu-
dent politicians meeting in dark
rooms to plan their grand strategy.

Since early fall, undergraduates
and law students have been busy
formulating plans, organizing state
and territorial delegations, and at-
tending to the many details con-
nected with staging the convention.

 

Mock conventions began at
Washington and Lee in 1908, and
have been held every four years
since, with the exception of 1920
and 1944.

In eleven previous conventions,
students have correctly nominated
seven presidential candidates—Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan (1908), Char-
les Evans Hughes (1916), John W.
Davis, ’92, (1924), Al Smith (1928),
Franklin D. Roosevelt (1932),
Dwight D. Eisenhower (1952) and

at the 1960 Mock Convention, al-

Scene from 1956 Mock Convention

though far removed from the polli-
tical scene, will be Miss America of
1960, Miss Lynda Lee Mead of
Natchez, Mississippi. She will ride
on one of the floats during the con-
vention parade down Lexington’s
Main street, and will participate in
other activities, as guest of the New
Jersey student delegation. This is
the second consecutive convention
brightened by a Miss America—the
Democratic convention of 1956 had
Miss America of 1956 on hand.

The Steering Committee of the
convention here has _ recently
named fifty-four state and territor-
ial delegation chairmen. ‘These stu-
dents are busy feeling out the poli-
tical climate in their respective
states, in order to cast an authentic
vote at the convention.

Activities for the convention as
planned at this stage call for the
parade, featuring floats, bands and
displays by the various state delega-
tions, to be held at g p.m. on Mon-
day, May eg. The convention it-
self will get underway at 4 p.m.
with the keynote address. Nomina-
tions of candidates and _ balloting
will follow, to be concluded Tues-
day, May 3.

Arrangements for a_ keynote
speaker have not yet been com-
pleted by students, but Charles L.
McCormick, III, convention chair-
man, said that a nationally known
figure had been invited.

Keynoters for the past two Mock
Conventions have been Republican
Senator Frank Carlson of Kansas
in 1952, and the late Alben W.
Barkley in 1956. Senator Barkley
collapsed and died while delivering
the keynote address here in 1956.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

® PRETTY HOLLINS junior Kitty Par-
sons missed her big moment this
year at Fancy Dress Ball.

Her steady date for three years,
David K. Weaver of Pelham, New
York, was president of the Ball,
and that meant Kitty was to reign
as queen. But fate threw her a
curve, and set Hollins examina-
tions during that time. Kitty had
one on Saturday morning after the
Ball, so she had to be denied her
moment of glory at the dance.

The Hollins exam schedule, de-
nounced here in no- uncertain
terms, had an impact on costume
rentals for the ball. Many Wash-
ington and Lee students, enamor-
ed of Hollins girls, were faithful in
their fashion, which meant they
declined to put up an $18 rental fee
to take substitute dates.

But the president of Fancy Dress
just has to have a date, and Dave
Weaver solved his dilemma in a
manner that no one, not even his
girl friend, could fault.

Leading the figure at the ball
with him was someone pretty spe-
cial, a lovely young lady from his
home town, whose name was Nancy
Weaver. After all, what kid sister
wouldn't help her brother out of
a jam?

Fancy Dress vice-presidents all
chose dates from Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College. It may have
turned out that way, Hollins exams
or not, but a one-college sweep of
the cherished figure roles has nev-
er happened before.

Theme of the fifty-first annual
Fancy Dress was “The Evolution
of Man,” with costumes drawn
from eight colorful periods of his-
tory: the Ming dynasty of China,
ancient Greece and Rome, medie-
val Europe, Renaissance Europe,
the era of Louis XIV of France, the
American Gay Nineties and Roar-
ing Twenties, and the space-age
future. However, because of an ap-

WINTER 1960

 

Dave WeEaAveER, right, president of Fancy
Dress, was almost the first president with-
out a date for the Ball. His sister, left, a
Mary Washington freshman, was his date,
after his steady Hollins girl had exams.

parent over-supply of some gar-
ments in the stocks of the profes-
sional agency supplying the _ cos-
tumes, the Confederate Army and
the Old South played a larger role
in the “Evolution of Man” than
most historians would be willing to
admit.

Playing for the ball this year was
Lester Lanin and his orchestra on
Friday night, and Lionel Hampton
and his orchestra on Saturday.

THE FACULTY HAS approved a non-
voting role on the school’s adminis-
trative committee for a represen-
tative of the student body execu-
tive committee.

The administrative committee,
which includes the university presi-
dent, the four deans and three fac-
ulty members, is charged with
handling all matters of student
discipline.

Named to the post by the student

group was William H. Abeloff,
senior law student from Richmond.
Abeloff, who has spent six years on
the Washington and Lee campus
earning bachelor and law degrees,
is also student body vice-president.

Dean Leon F. Sensabaugh said
student participation in committee
meetings will afford student repre-
sentation in an area of direct con-

cern to them. He said the move was
in line with the university’s policy
of giving students important roles
in as many phases of university ad-
ministration as possible.

 

WASHINGTON AND LEE has been
named with 600 other American
privately-operated colleges and
universities to share in the Gulf
Oil Corporations’ aid to educa-
cation program this year. The Gulf
company said it was seeking to
help many colleges with “modest
amounts,’ rather than make large
grants to a small number of schools.

Individual gifts were determined

| by a formula based on current ex-

penditures per student for educa-
tional purposes, and the percentage
of alumni contributing to the col-

lege. Washington and Lee, which
ranks relatively high in both re-
spects, received $509 in Gulf funds.

THE UNIVERSITY has been selected
by the Texaco, Inc., aid-to-educa-
tion program to receive an unre-
stricted grant of $1,500 for the
1959-60 academic year. The money
will be used to improve faculty sal-
aries.

Washington and Lee is one of
140 privately financed American
colleges and universities receiving
direct grants from the Texaco cor-
poration. Texaco also provides
scholarship and fellowship assist-
ance for approximately 300  stu-
dents at more than 80 private and
tax-supported institutions.

The 1959-60 grant is the fourth
such gift received from ‘Texaco.

THE SHELL COMPANIES Founda-
tion has selected Washington and
Lee to participate in its program of
“Shell Assists” to American educa-
tion. The University will receive
$1,500 for use during 1960.

Under terms of the grant, one-
third of the sum is for unrestricted
use, one-third for use by the chief
faculty administrative officer to
help encourage further professional
development among faculty mem-
bers, and one-third for faculty pro-
fessional development in the de-
partments of engineering, mathe-
matics, and the physical sciences.

 

™ WHEN THE GAINES GUARD drill

team appeared in_ Lexington’s
Christmas parade on December 5,
1959, 1t marked the eighth anni-
versary of the formation of the
crack marching unit.

For most of the alumni, the
idea of a University drill team
still seems remote, for although the
school bears the name of famous
genenals, it is essentially a non-
military institution.

10

But the Gaines Guard is defi-
nitely a part of the college tradi-
tion, honoring with its name the
retired president, Dr. Francis P.
Gaines. It was an outgrowth of the
installation of a Reserve Officers’
Training Corps program in 1951
at the height of the Korean War.
The idea originated with Norman
Dobyns, °54. Organization was
completed in time for the unit to
march in the annual Lexington
Christmas parade.

Since then, interest and partici-
pation in the Guard has grown. In
1954, it formed one of two honor
guards at the inauguration of Gov-
ernor Thomas B. Stanley in Rich-
mond. It was invited to march in
the Presidential Inaugural  Pa-
rade in Washington in 1956. The
team spends three hours per week
of close-order drill, and members
wear a distinctive uniform, which
this year includes white helmet
liners, shoulder cords, web waist-
belts, gloves, and web slings on
their Springfield drill rifles.

 

ROSS MALONE, °32, former presi-
ident of the American Bar Asso-

ciation, will deliver the ‘Tucker
Law Lectures here on April 15, 16.
He has chosen as his subject, “The
Lawyer and His Professional Re-
sponsibilities,’ and will speak both
Friday and Saturday.

Law Day will be observed on
April 16, for the first time at
Washington and Lee Law School.

Edward S. Graves, ’30 of Lynch-
burg, Virginia, is Law Day chair-
man this year.

chosen a Rhodes Scholar in 1954.

will conduct the regular classes he
has taught at Washington and Lee
since 1919.

He will be succeeded as dean
next year by Prof. Charles P. Light,
Jr., who has served on Dean Wil-
liams’ faculty since 1926.

“We are indeed fortunate that
Dean Williams has consented to
remain as an active member of
the law faculty,” President Cole
said. “I know his students are de-

= AN UNDEFEATED Swimming team, a
winning wrestling season, and a
break-even mark in_ basketball
were in prospect at Washington
and Lee as the winter sports sched-
ule entered their final weeks.

Unbeaten in six meets, Coach
Cy ‘'wombly’s swimmers need only
victories over William and Mary
and the Norfolk Division of Wil-
liam and Mary to give Washington
and Lee its first unblemished dual
meet record since the late 1930's.
Coach Twombly went five straight
years without a loss in pre-war
competition.

Top individual standout is a
sophomore _ breast-stroker, Elliott
Maynard from Portland, Maine.
Last year, Maynard set a new school
200-yd. butterfly mark, and _ this
season he added the  200-yd.
breast-stroke to his title list. Against
Wake Forest, he covered the dis-
tance in 2:19.4, a full five seconds
better than the old standard.

The 400-yd. medley relay team,
composed of Maynard, Pete Weim-
er, Skip Rohnke, and Gene Pur-
nell, took almost three seconds oft
the school record in that event.

In their six wins, the General
mermen have not been pressed, al-
though West Virginia won more
first places. Besides the Mountain-
eers and Deacons, Washington and
Lee has beaten Roanoke College,
American University, Catholic Uni-
versity, and Virginia.

In wrestling, Coach Dick Miller’s
youngsters are 4-2 for the season
and stand a good chance of sweep-
ing their remaining three matches.
Getting good service from some
talented freshmen, the Generals
have posted wins over North Car-

olina, Duke, New York University,
and Gallaudet, while losing to per-
ennially strong Franklin and Mar-
shall and defending Southern Con-
ference champion West Virginia.

Junior Drew Danko at 177 and
sophomore Danny Dyer at 137 have
4-1 records to set the pace in in-
dividual performances. Among the
classy freshmen on the varsity are
123-pounder Dave Montgomery,
130-pounder Bill Spencer-Strong,
and 157-pounder Dick Albert.

Matches remain with Wake
Forest, Hampden-Sydney, and Vir-
ginia.

Having adjusted their schedule
along more realistic lines, the
Generals are moving toward a
.500 mark in basketball, a marked
improvement over last year’s 1-15

record against Southern Conference
competition.

With three games to go, Coach
Bob McHenry’s team has posted a
7-8 record against competition
made up largely of Virginia’s “Lit-
tle Eight” and Mason-Dixon Con-
ference teams.

All the Generals’ triumphs have
come at home, and if they are to
get that break-even season, wins are
needed in at least two of the three
remaining road contests. One of
the games left is with old rival
Virginia, and although the Cava-
liers are the patsies of the Atlantic
Coast Conference, they are expect-
ed to prove too much for Washing-
ton and Lee.

Classes of ’10, ’20, °35, and ’50

Will Reunite Here in May

T’S THAT TIME again! Time to
I talk about all the fun of the
Washington and Lee class reunions,
the renewal of old friendships, and
a return visit to the familiar old
Washington and Lee campus.

The reunions this year have been
set for Friday til Sunday, May 20-
22, and a good program is being
planned.

There will be a new feature this
year at the 60 Reunion. In addi-
tion to the fiftieth, fortieth, and
twenty-fifth anniversary classes, the
gathering will also include men of
the tenth anniversary class. The
high interest shown, and the many
requests for a reunion from alumni
of this era have indicated that this
reunion is strongly desired and will
be well-attended. The Alumni
Board of Trustees has approved the
inclusion of this first convocation
for the class of 1950.

It was just five years ago, in 1955,
that the custom of the spring reun-
ions was begun. It followed on the
heels of two highly successful gen-
eral reunions, in the Bicentennial
year of 1949, and again in 1954.
At first, only the twenty-fifth and
fiftieth year classes came back. In
1957, the fortieth year class was
added. Now in 1960, another class
is being included, to make the re-
union even larger, more interesting,
and more representative of all seg-
ments of alumni.

Alumni and their wives of the
law and academic classes of 1910,
1920, 1935, and 1950 will be guests
of the University for this reunion,
following the established practice.

12

They will be housed in hotels and
nearby motels.

The tentative program is set up
like this: first item, registration, to
be held on Friday, May 20. A
smoker will follow that night. In-
cluded among the other events, but
without a time schedule as yet, are:
discussions by college officials on
the State of the University, class
banquets, a golf tournament, and
programs and side trips for the
ladies. Conclusion of the reunion
will be a service in Lee Chapel on
Sunday. The program will be de-
signed for enjoyment and inspira-
tion, irrespective of the class.

University students will be hav-
ing final examinations at that time,
so, other than the Reunion excite-
ment, the campus will be fairly
quiet.

Each member of the four anni-
versary classes will receive further
details through the mail in the
coming months.

But meanwhile, you men of ’10,
20, °35, and ’50, circle in red the
dates of May 20-22 on your calen-
dar, and make your plans NOW to
come back for Reunion time!

IFTS TO WASHINGTON AND LEE’S
(y capital funds campaign reach-
ed the $1,900,000 mark on Feb-
ruary 1. Of this amount $1,400,000
has been designated for new phys-
ics, geology, biology, pre-engineer-
ing and journalism facilities  to-
ward the goal of $2,000,000 for
these buildings. Approximately
$500,000 has been donated to the
University’s endowment, the in-
come to be used chiefly for scholar-
ships and faculty salaries.

Since the drive for capital funds
began in July 1958 gifts have been
received from approximately 4,000
alumni, parents, and friends of the
University from all over the coun-
try. Campaigns involving intensive
solicitation were planned for 44 dif-
ferent geographical areas which
had a concentration of 100 or more
alumni, friends, and parents.

Of these 44 areas 31 have been
completed or are now in the active
solicitation stage. The 13 remain-
ing areas where campaigns will be
conducted in the following months
include Long Island with Clark B.

Students Take Good Art

Along With Regular Meals

LOW-PRESSURE PROGRAM to ac-
A quaint more students with
good painting was begun this win-
ter at Washington and Lee.

Two exhibits of paintings are
hung in the lounges of Evans Din-
ing Hall, right on the beaten path
of the students who eat three meals
daily there.

Professor Marion M. Junkin, pro-
fessor of Fine Arts, calls the exhibit
an experimental “living with art”
for students.

He said experience has taught
him that relatively few students
will go out of their way to view
paintings, but most show an inter-

est in art if it is placed within easy
reach.

Idea for the Evans Hall exhibits
originated with president Fred C.
Cole. Dr. Cole, noting the display
possibilities of the lounge walls,
suggested that rotating art exhibits
there would make a new contribu-
tion to the liberal arts education of
Washington and Lee students.

Professor Junkin gave his enthu-
Silastic support to the plan and pro-
ceeded to borrow two exhibits, one
modern and the other conservative,
from the permanent collection of
the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.

The paintings, twenty in all, are

 

to be changed every three months.
An effort will be made to provide
variety and balance in the exhibits.

Conservative or traditional paint-
ings are hung in the right wing
lounge, with modern art works in
the left wing lounge. Dr. Junkin
says the separation will enable him
to study student reaction to the
different forms. But he thinks the
modern group will be more popu-
lar.

“A student may make disparag-
ing remarks about modern paint-
ing, but he will spend ten or fifteen
minutes looking at the pictures
whereas he'll just give the tradi-
tional paintings a brief once-over,”
the professor says.

A printed brochure containing
information about each picture in
the exhibit has been prepared for
student viewers and others by Dr.
Junkin.

Among the American painters
represented in the exhibits are Rob-
ert Gwathmey, Paul Arlt, Henry
Lee McFee, Lamar Dodd, and Gio-
vanni Martino. European artists
represented include Stanley Hayter,
George Braque, and Jean Lurcat.

The Evans Hall exhibits are not
replacing the Fine Arts Depart-
ment’s regular monthly exhibits in
duPont Hall. Rather, they are pro-
viding additional exposure to art
for more students, who are getting
their artistic doses administered in
a painless, pleasant way.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

 

Next Issue Will Have
Special Supplement

The next issue of the Alumni
Magazine will contain a_ special
supplement on “The Alumnus.”
Alumni magazine editors and writ-
ers throughout the country have
joined in this cooperative effort to
tell the story of you, who are, in
the words of the report, “one of
the most important persons in
American higher education today.”

There will be sixteen pages of
pictures and text, prepared by a
group of alumni editors who have
been working on the project for
months. Three hundred and fifty
other alumni magazines in the
United States, Canada and Mexico
will include the supplement in
their spring issues.

scorer with 221 points and a 14.7
average for 15 games. Another sen-
ior guard, Frank Surface, has aver-
aged 11.5, and senior forward Jack
Daughtrey has a 11.6 average.

A pair of talented freshmen, 6-2
Rodger Fauber and 5-11 Ken Ko-
walski, have given the team a big
boost, and the return at mid-term
of 6-3 Steve Rutledge has bolstered
the squad’s depth.

The Generals lost two to Bridge-
water and to Sewanee and Chatta-
nooga before getting their first win
over Emory and Henry. Losses to
Richmond and Catholic Universi-
ty followed, and then they posted
consecutive wins over Randolph-
Macon, Catholic, and Hampden-
Sydney before the exam break. In
February, the Generals lost to
Hampden-Sydney, beat Washing-

Randolph-Macon, and then de-

WINTER 1960

1959-60 Alumni Fund Solicitation

Now Under Way in Certain Areas

Y THIS TIME, a number of you
have received letters from your
class agents regarding the reactiva-

tion of the Alumni Fund on a limit-

ed basis for 1960.

The program, planned so it will
not conflict with the capital gifts
campaign which is now in its sec-
ond year, is set up this way:

No alumnus who has given to the
capital gifts campaign is being
solicited until his pledge has
been paid in full, or in the same
academic year of his gift, even
though his pledge is already paid.
Those solicited are to fall into
two groups—those who have had
an opportunity to pledge to the
capital fund drive and who did
not, and those who had_ paid
their pledges to the drive in full,
prior to September 1, 1959.

In the areas which have not yet
staged their fund drives, alumni are
not being contacted in behalf of the
Alumni Fund.

However, if there is a desire to
make a contribution, alumni may
contact their class agents (see in-
side front cover for names and ad-
dresses). There will be no regional
agents this year during the limited
solicitation, and no established con-
tributor or dollar goals.

This is the twenty-sixth year of
the Class Agent plan. Each year,
the Alumni Fund has shown a
steady increase, both in number
and amount of contribution. In
this year, when the fund is moving

burg, Emory and Henry, and Vir-
ginia.

In a sport that draws no specta-
tors and very little publicity,
Washington and Lee has compiled
a 4-4 season with its rifle team.

from a state of merger with the
capital gifts program to a rejuven-
ated role of its own, Washington
and Lee needs the loyal support of
her sons more than ever.

The ever-present day-to-day
needs of the University are contin-
ually increasing. To meet these
challenges that he ahead, Washing-
ton and Lee must look to the con-
tinued annual support from its
many alumni and friends.

George Washington’s Gift
Is Still Helping Students

OMEWHERE IN Washington and
Lee’s endowment assets of
more than fourteen million dollars
are fifty thousand hard-working
dollars which have been helping to
pay for education of young men for
158 years.

The sum represents the gift of
one hundred shares of James River
Navigation Company stock to the
school by George Washington in
1796, first large gift of securities
to a college in the United States.

And although the gift lost its
singular identity in 1928, when the
state retired the certificates of in-
debtedness, the $50,000 which the
University received from its par
value continues to earn some $2,000
each year.

As Chancellor F. P. Gaines used
to tell freshmen each year, that
means the generosity of George
Washington is responsible for two
to three dollars of their annual tui-
tion expenses.

In all, the Washington gift has
earned for the University approx-
imately $413,000. Interest and div-
idends have ranged as high as 18
per cent, as low as three. The cur-
rent return is about four per cent.

thor of a recent volume of verses, ‘Falling
Leaves,” a collection of 90 of his poems.
One of his poems, entitled, “Alina Mater”
is a very nice tribute to Washington and
Lee. It begins,

“Between the Blue Ridge and Alleghen-
ies

In the vale of Shenandoah

Stands my dear old Alma Mater,

Memory days of long ago.

Blest with ideals grand and noble

Born from out a generous hand—

It has glorified the ages

It has brightened the hopes of man.

Near the banks of old North River,
Beneath the bright Virginia skies.
Where the blue caresses the mountains
And the immortal Stonewall lies,

Came a call from my Alma Mater

An urgent call to General Lee,

Came a call for a brilliant thinker,
Man of force and sympathy.”

WILLIAM A. HYMAN, 712

m™ WHILE NATIONS of men_ have
thrilled to the latest exploits in
space, a New York lawyer with
both feet on the ground has been
thinking of space from a different
angle. William A. Hyman, ’12, 1s
viewing the legal aspects of the
space age with a practiced eye; so
much so, that he has become known
as the world’s leading “space law-
yer.” He has recently returned to
New York from a Far Eastern trip,
where he spoke to groups and was
interviewed in Hong Kong, Manila,
and Japan. In Japan, he was in-
vited to lecture the faculty and
students at Kyoto University on
regulations of outer space, and
in the Philippine Islands, he spoke
on the same subject to the Philip-
pine Lawyers Association.

Mr. Hyman, senior member of
the firm Hyman, Hayman, and
Harris, at 111 Fulton Street in New
York, is an insurance lawyer. Space
law is his hobby—and a very inter-

esting one. He now heads space
study groups for the New York
County Lawyers Association, the
Federal Bar Association of New
York, New Jersey, and Connecticut,
and the Inter-American Bar Asso-
ciation, and formerly headed such
studies for both the New York and
American Bar Associations.

Suppose another nation’s rocket
or missile accidentally hits an air-
liner over the ocean, or perhaps
strikes a city and demolishes a num-
ber of buildings? Property is dam-
aged, people are killed. What’s the
law? What's the remedy? Whom do
you sue?

“As of today,” says Mr. Hyman,
“there is no law, no agreement
among nations, no remedy for in-
dividuals who may be killed or
whose property may be damaged.
We shouldn’t wait for incidents to
happen. What we need is to estab-
lish fundamental law and standards
for regulation of outer space for

what constitutes outer space; pro-

outer space; provision for avoid-

space vehicles; principles of lia-

HEN NORFLEET TURNER, ’24, Was
Wee chairman of the board
of the First National Bank of Mem-
phis last month, Allen B. Morgan,
‘29, succeeded him as president.

This marked another step in the
parallel careers of two alumni who
have worked together as a team
since their entry into the business
world. Mr. Turner began his fi-
nancial career as a transit clerk in
a Memphis bank in 1923, and in
1929, was made manager of the
First Securities Corporation, an
afhliate of the First National Bank.
Shortly after, Allen Morgan, just
out of college, joined the firm as a
bond salesman.

In 1933, when Mr. Turner was
made a vice-president of First Na-
tional, Mr. Morgan succeeded him
as manager of what had then be-
come the bank’s Bond Department.
Four years later, Mr. ‘Turner was
named executive vice-president,
and Mr. Morgan was elevated to
vice-president. In 1943, Mr. Turner
became president of the bank, and
in 1946, Mr. Morgan was named
executive vice-president. Both
men enjoyed the distinction of be-
ing the youngest vice-presidents in
Memphis banking history. Both
are also members of the bank’s
board of directors.

The striking parallel of their
banking careers is matched, in
many ways, by the similarity of
their business, civic, and _ social
activities. Both are Episcopalians;
both are past directors and _ treas-
urers of the Memphis Chamber of
Commerce, Memphis Rotary Club
and Memphis chapter, American
Red Cross. Both have sucessfully
headed the community’s major an-
nual charity drive, Mr. Turner as
president of the Community Chest,
Mr. Morgan as general chairman of
its sucessor, Shelby United Neigh-
bors. Both have also been active
in fund-raising drives for colleges,

hospitals, character-building _ or-
ganizations and_ similar under-
takings.

NORFLEET TURNER, '24, left, chairman of the board, and ALLEN MorcGan, ’29, right,
president of the First National Bank of Memphis, Tennessee.

Both have served on the Execu-
tive Council of the American Bank-
ers’ Association. Mr. Turner, a
former director of the Federal Re-
serve Bank of St. Louis, was re-
cently named to the Federal Ad-
visory Council, a twelve-man board
which makes recommendations to
the Federal Reserve Board. Mr.
Morgan is a member of the board
of directors of Continental Bak-
ing Company, and a former mem-
ber of the Alumni Board of Trus-
tees of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity.

When the Turner-Morgan team
first became associated with the
bank, it was relatively small, with
total resources of about $24,000,-
000. Over the years they have seen
it become one of the major bank-
ing institutions of the South, with
resources last year of $309,939,117.
While this spectacular growth was
due, in part, to changing economic
conditions and population increase,

a substantial portion was directly
attributable to the aggressive efforts
of the two men. One of the first
steps taken by them as heads of
the bank was establishment of a
business development program.
Through sales training and use of
a permanent incentive plan, this
program has been expanded to in-
clude both officers and employees
of the bank, thus increasing the
bank’s “‘sales force.” A profit-
sharing plan was also adopted,
providing added incentive to staff
members in furthering the bank’s
growth.

As a final parallel, both are de-
voted family men. Mr. Turner is
married to the former Elinor Rag-
land, and Mr. Morgan to the for-
mer Elise Wetter. The ‘Turners
have a son, Norfleet Ragland, ’51,
and a daughter, Mrs. Edward
Giobbi of Florence, Italy. The
Morgans have two sons, Allen, Jr.
and Henry, and a daughter, Elise.
