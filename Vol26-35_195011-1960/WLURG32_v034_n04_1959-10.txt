The George F. Baker Scholarships

NE OF THE MOST significant de-
O velopments in recent years at
the University has been the an-
nouncement that Washington and
Lee will be one of twelve liberal
arts colleges in the country to share
in the scholarship program of the
George F. Baker Trust of New
York. An initial grant of $50,000
has been received from the Trust
to establish George F. Baker Schol-
arships for freshmen entering in
1960, 1961, and 1962. Three or four
scholarships will be awarded each
year, to be held by the recipients
over their entire four-year college
course.

The purpose of the George F.
Baker Scholarships is to provide
opportunity for young men of the
highest overall promise in charac-
ter, leadership and _ intellectual
capacity to obtain a high quality
education regardless of their eco-
nomic circumstances.

The size of the stipend will be
gauged by the candidate’s economic
need and may run as high as $2000
a year. The scholarship is intended
to cover all college expenses that lie
beyond a candidate’s own resources.

The Baker Scholaships at Wash-
ington and Lee are open to all en-
tering students. The donors have
expressed the hope that a substan-
tial number of scholarship holders
will seek careers in constructive
business activity, for the awards
were made possible by the work
of men who devoted their lives to
business, and the present ability of
the Trust to maintain scholarships

2

depends directly upon business ac-
tivity. Nevertheless, the donors be-
lieve that leadership of first quality
is needed in every field of human
activity, and they would lke to

have students of ability, whatever
their plans for the future, encour-
aged to apply for the Baker Schol-
arships.

No geographical restrictions for

 

criteria:

I. GHARACTER

IV. NEED

for a scholarship.

 

QUALIFICATIONS

Applicants will be considered on the basis of the following

The recipient shall have an outstanding character as demon-
strated by adherence to the highest possible standards of per-
sonal conduct and influence; by a sense of responsibility in his
life’s purpose; and by a spirit of unselfishness.

Il. INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY

The recipient’s total academic record in secondary school
should indicate both superior ability and achievement. ‘There
should be especial emphasis on steady, independent habits of work,
showing performance regularly consistent with capacity.

Ill. MoOrrvATION AND LEADERSHIP

The recipient shall present evidence of leadership as shown
by a high degree of acceptance by his contemporaries; and by a
strong quality of effective participation in some extracurricular
activities of worthwhile purpose.

Recipients will be selected on their relative rating under the
preceding heads, but the amount granted will be graduated accord-
ing to the actual financial need of the recipient. Candidates who
can well afford to finance their college education should not apply

 

 

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

at Washington and Lee University

selection of candidates are imposed
but the George F. Baker Trust has
suggested that Washington and Lee
seek applicants from the South and
border states as the area from
Washington and Lee now draws
around seventy per cent of its stu-
dent body.

The Trust has requested that
members of the institution’s Board
of ‘Trustees play an important part
in the selection of candidates. The
University Scholarship Committee
will review the records of all candi-
dates, screen them, and present a
limited group who will come to the
campus as the guests of the Univer-
sity. From this number, the trustees
will select the successful winners.
The University trustees who will
serve are Huston St. Clair, Taze-
well, Virginia; Joseph Lamar Lan-
ier, West Point, Georgia; and the
Rev. John Newton Thomas, of
Richmond, Virginia.

Successful administration of the
initial grant of $50,000 will make
Washington and Lee eligible for
additional George F. Baker Funds.

* * *

The George F. Baker Trust was
established by the will of George F.
Baker, Jr., who died in 1937. Trus-
tees include members of his imme-
diate family and close business as-
sociates.

Both Mr. Baker and his father
before him had been, over a period
of many years, generous supporters
of a number of hospitals, educa-

OCTOBER 1959

tional institutions, and private or-
ganizations interested in social wel-
fare. The Trustees undertook to
continue the support of these nu-
merous and excellent organizations.

Mr. Baker and his father had
demonstrated by their own gifts
great interest in the field of educa-
tion. The buildings of the Harvard
Graduate School of Business Ad-
ministration, the Library at Dart-
mouth, the Chemistry Laboratory
of Cornell University, the Baker
Field for Columbia University in
New York City were among their
interests. The Trustees of the Bak-
er ‘Trust in 1946 undertook the sup-
port of scholarships for young men
of outstanding over-all promise at
a number of small, privately en-
dowed liberal arts colleges, geo-
graphically spread across the coun-
try. Since that time, funds for this

purpose have been placed at twen-
ty different educational institu-
tions, and some five hundred young
men have been directly aided in
the securing of their higher educa-
tion. About two hundred holders of
the George F. Baker Scholarships
are now in residence at the different
colleges. Around fifty enter the vari-
ous colleges each fall, and an equal
number are graduated each spring.

* * *

Colleges where Baker Scholar-
ships are being awarded in 1960-61
are as follows: Grinnell College,
Hamilton College, Knox College,
Pomona College, Reed College.
Southwestern at Memphis, Stan-
ford University, The College of
Wooster, ‘Trinity College, Wabash
College, Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, and Wesleyan University.

WAYS IN WHICH
A LOYAL ALUMNUS CAN HELP:

1. Read over the information and conditions in this issue in connec-

tion with the Baker Scholarships.

2. Endeavor to locate one or more outstanding preparatory or high

school seniors who would, in your judgment, be highly qualified for con-
sideration for a Baker award. Sources of information on candidates would
be consultation with school heads, guidance officials, and teachers; sons of
your friends; acquaintances of your own children.

3. Talk to the candidate about Washington and Lee and the Baker
Scholarships. It he is interested, have him make personal application for
admission and scholarship consideration, and you, yourself, write a letter
to the Committee on Scholarships endorsing him for consideration on the
basis of qualifications on page 2, not later than February 15.

GEORGE F. BAKER, JR.
(1878-1937)

George F. Baker, Jr., founder of
the George F. Baker ‘Trust, was
born in New York City, where his
father was president of The First
National Bank of New York City.
The lives of both the father and
son were closely intertwined with
the history and development of
that great financial institution. ‘The
bank was deeply influential in the
building of both the American rail-
road empire and large industrial
corporations.

George F. Baker, Jr. attended
Hotchkiss, and was graduated from
Harvard in 1899. He first worked
at the office of J. P. Morgan and
Company as a messenger. He re-
mained with the firm until May,
1901, when he was offered the post
of assistant cashier at the First Na-
tional Bank, New York. From then
on, his business career was with
that bank. He remained assistant
cashier until early in 1906 when he
became vice-president. Later that
same year he was elected to the
Board of Directors. In July, 1918,
Mr. Baker undertook a mission to
Italy on behalf of the American
Red Cross. On his return in Sep-
tember he enlisted as a private in
the United States Army and was
sent to Camp Zachary ‘Taylor, Ken-
tucky. Returning to the bank after
the war, he became vice-chairman
of the Board in 1922, and, after his
father’s death in 1931, chairman.

His business career brought him
directorates in a number of leading
business corporations including
American ‘Telephone and ‘Tele-
graph Company, General Motors
Corporation, General Electric
Company, United States Steel Cor-
poration, and the New York Cen-
tral Railroad.

Mr. Baker was always exceeding-
ly close to his father, joining in and
backing up his father’s numerous
business and philanthropic under-
takings. He was a man of broad
outlook and the highest standards.

4

 

GEORGE F. BAKER, JR.

His last years were marked by ill-
ness, and while visiting Honolulu,
he died in 1937.

One of Mr. Baker’s close business
associates has written of him:

“The clear and penetrating mind
for affairs, coupled with a stand-
ard of business honor and almost
unique in its severity, and appli-
cable always and_ rigorously
against himself; the conscien-
tious devotion to any task be-
gun, or responsibility assumed;
the patriot’s love of country; the
sailor’s courage; generosity that
sought to make substantial gifts
unnoticed, and yet given with
such tact and skill as to warm
the soul of the beneficiary; can-
dor, simplicity, modesty, innate
consideration for others, and the
kindest heart we have ever
known.”

New President Dr. Fred Carrington Cole, right, is welcomed to the campus by Dean of
Students Frank J. Gilliam and Dean of the University Leon F. Sensabaugh on Sept. 2.

University News

NEW PRESIDENT, the largest

freshman class in its history,
and the opening of the new
$1,500,000 dining hall-dormitory
project highlighted the beginning
of Washington and Lee’s two hun-
dred and eleventh academic year
in mid-September.

Dr. Fred Carrington Cole, named
last June to succeed retiring Presi-
dent Francis P. Gaines, took over
the school’s administration on Sep-
tember 2. He is the fourteenth man
to assume the presidency.

A freshman class of 328 students
registered on September 14, slight-
ly more than last year’s total of 313.
In addition, 682 upperclassmen reg-
istered, plus 116 in the School of
Law for a total of 1126 students
this year. President Cole greeted the
student body for the first time on
September 16, when he spoke at the
opening University assembly in
Doremus Gymnasium.

6

Dr. Cole told the group, “To be
associated with Washington and
Lee, as a student, a faculty member,
or an administrative officer, is a
privilege and a distinction.”

“In pursuit of a degree, however,
it is important that you get the sub-
stance of an education and not
merely the form.

“Wisdom” Dr. Cole said, “is the
possession of the educated man—
not the man with 123 semesters of
knowledge, but the man who un-
derstands what he knows, who con-
tinues to learn, and who makes ob-
jective judgment. The acquisition
of wisdom should be your objective
here. How well you attain that ob-
jective will determine how well you
will be prepared to succeed in your
personal lives and careers, to bring
credit to your university, and to
give your country the enlightened
leadership which it expects and
desperately needs from you.”

This school year will be signifi-
cant in other ways. It will mark
the probable completion of a two-
million dollar capital fund cam-
paign, to provide funds for new sci-
ence and journalism facilities.
Since the University Development
Program began last November, well
over a million dollars has already
been pledged or contributed.

For students, the new year will
bring the twelfth renewal of the
famed Mock Convention, at which
they will seek to nominate a presi-
dential candidate for the Democrat-
ic party. The convention will be
held in early May.

 

SIX NEW TEACHERS joined the fac-
ulty in September. ‘They were: Dr.
Leonard E. Jarrard, assistant pro-

fesor of psychology; Robert D.
Whitaker, °55, assistant professor of
chemistry; Charles F. Phillips, Jr.,
assistant professor of economics; Dr.
Earl L. Crum, visiting professor of
ancient languages; William F. St.
Clair, assistant professor of physics;
and John K. Jennings, ’56, instruc-
tor in journalism and communica-
tions.

Jennings achieved nationwide
recognition as a student fon his
radio coverage of the death of Sen-
ator Alben W. Barkley while ad-
dressing the 1956 Democratic Mock
Convention here. His tape record-
ing of Barkley’s final speech and his
eye-witness description of the sen-
ator’s collapse were used on net-
work broadcasts by the Columbia
Broadcasting System.

m DR. CHARLES W. WILLIAMS, aSsOCl-
ate profesor of math, participated
in an eight-week summer institute
at the University of California at
Los Angeles, July 6-August 28.

Sponsored by the National Sci-
ence Foundation and UCLA, the
institute conducted special courses
in numerical analysis for fifty col-
lege professors.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

# PROMOTIONS HAVE been announc-
ed for two faculty members. Dr. A.
Ross Borden was promoted to pro-
fessor of English, and Dr. Edward
C. Atwood, Jr. to associate profes-
sor of economics.

m TRUSTEES HAVE approved a plan
whereby the University will con-
tribute up to $2,800 for the college
education of children of faculty
and staff members.

The new plan will permit Wash-
ington and Lee’s withdrawal from
a cumbersome tuition exchange
program carried out among 245
colleges. The plan provides for an-
nual maximum grants of $700 for
four years of undergraduate edu-
cation for sons and daughters of
fulltime faculty and staff members
of two years standing or more.

Some seventeen young people are
shortly expected to be eligible for
benefits under this plan.

# THE MEMORIES of twenty-nine
years as president of Washington
and Lee are hard to capsule into
the thoughts of a single hour.

But recalling years of achieve-
ment which made him one of the
nation’s foremost educators, Dr.
Francis P. Gaines said, “No man
could ask for a finer privilege. I
go out of office without a single dis-
appointment, except in my own
performance. I have only happy
and grateful feelings for all those
who have supported me—the trus-
tees, faculty, my staff and the stu-
dents, and the many other good
friends of this university.”

The personal shortcoming which
grieved him most, he declared, was
the unavoidable shrinking of his
intimate contacts with the student
body.

“The apparent and growing op-
portunities for service away from
the campus have denied to me the
opportunity to be a part of student
life,” he said, as he began his re-
tirement on September 1. “When I
came to this office, I wanted to be a
students’ president.” And for many

OCTOBER 1959

years, he was very close to his stu-
dents.

But gradually, the president’s
broadening responsibilities took
him more and more away from the
everyday business of running the
college. “I think the president’s
duties changed when the college
recognized its need for varied and
generous cooperation from those
other than its immediate family,”
he said. “It became necessary to

take the college to the supporting ©

publics, not wait for them to come
to it.”

How well he measured up to this
role can be gauged by Washington
and Lee’s steady march of progress
during his administration.

Dr. Gaines says he commends
new President Fred C. Cole to the
University family “with confidence
and joy” as aman of “uncommon-
ly fine qualifications and influential
leadership.”

He has pledged Dr. Cole his full
services for consultation and _ ad-
vice, but says he is anxious to give
the new president a clear field to
form his own opinions and set his
own course.

As for Dr. Gaines’ immediate fu-
ture, he is continuing to serve as
an active worker in the $2,000,000
fund drive. Within the next few
months, he will address alumni
groups in about twenty cities in
support of the campaign.

With this activity behind him, he
will perhaps turn to writing. He
would like to do a book of remin-
iscences, and perhaps some creative
writing. He hopes the long period
of literary inactivity he has under-
gone will not prove a handicap to
resuming the work he enjoys. He
also plans to engage in occasional
lecturing at other colleges, and
would like to visit Europe once
more.

He and Mrs. Gaines are complet-
ing a new home at the corner of
Estill and Washington streets, ad-
Jacent to six fraternity houses. So
he can look forward to continuing

close relations with the Washington
and Lee students, and he will be a
welcome neighbor to them.

For in fact, he has been more of
a ‘students’ president” than he
perhaps realizes. 7

A STATEMENT OF
APPRECIATION

“Since the announcement of his
retirement, Dr. Gaines has been
widely acclaimed for his eminence
in the field of education, with es-
pecial reference to his 29-year ten-
ure as president of Washington and
Lee University. As President of the
Alumni Association during his last
year in office, I welcome this oppor-
tunity in behalf of the alumni to
express their appreciation of his
magnificent service to their alma
mater.

“Washington and Lee has gained
ever-increasing prestige under his
administration. Moreover, as Past
President of the Association of
American Colleges and winner of a
score or more of earned and hon-
orary degrees, awards and decora-
tions, in peace and war, at home
and abroad, he has demonstrated a
remarkable aptitude for public ser-
vice.

“The magic of his words and
presence has served to remind a
thousand audiences that private in-
stitutions of higher learning are in-
dispensable to the preservation of
the freedoms we are taught to ven-
erate.

“For the superior qualities of the
intellectual, moral, and spiritual
leadership in all phases of his chos-
en profession and the powerful and
eloquent voice with which he has
long served his country and its in-
stitutions, he has earned, not a
page, but a long and_ brilliant
chapter in the history of Washing-
ton and Lee.”

m DR. BRANTSON BEESON HOLDER, asso-
ciate professor of commerce and
economics, retired in June.

Dr. Holder, seventy, joined the
faculty in 1941. In his eighteen
years at Washington and Lee, his
booming voice echoing from New-
comb Hall became a familiar sound
in the warm months when class-
room windows were open. He has
taught courses in transportation,
public utilities, governmental con-
trol of business, and business law.

He was born near Winston-
Salem, North Carolina, and won
his bachelor of arts, master of arts,
and doctor of philosophy degrees
from the University of North Caro-
lina. He also read law, and got a
license to practice in North Caro-
lina in 1921.

He and Mrs. Holder retired to
their 180-acre farm in Lenore
county, North Carolina.

 

m THE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL office
was moved this fall from its old lo-
cation at 214 West Washington
street to the ground floor of the
new Davis Dormitory.

The old quarters were remodeled
during the summer and converted
into an annex of the freshman
dormitory, in order to handle the
large number of new matriculates.

Miss Fannie Page Allen, nurse in
the medical office for the past six-
teen years, has retired. Replacing
her is Mrs. R. Reid Agnor, Jr., wife
of Reid Agnor, ‘46.

LAST SPRING, ten colleges in Amer-
ica featured on film the 1958 ‘Toyn-
bee lectures at Washington and
Lee. Encyclopedia — Britannica
Films, Inc. photographed the lec-
tures, with the help of a grant
from the Fund for the Advance-
ment of Education.

:

The series of fifteen two-hour
lectures were used at five Illinois
and five Virginia colleges, as a pilot
study of techniques by which Amer-
ican students can be exposed to the
great men, great ideas, and great
issues of contemporary society.

Participating were Blackburn
College; Illinois College; MacMur-
ray College; Illinois Wesleyan; and
Millikin University in Illinois; and
in Virginia, Randolph-Macon;
Randolph-Macon Woman’s_ Col-
lege; and Virginia State and Vir-
ginia Union Universities.

# OIL PAINTINGS of General Robert
E. Lee as a second lieutenant, Mrs.
Lee as a young woman, and_ her
father; George Washington Parke
Custis, have been received by
Washington and Lee from the
estate of Robert E. Lee, III.

The Lee portraits are in the Lee
Museum of Lee Chapel, and the
Custis portrait hangs in the lobby
of Washington Hall. The paint-
ings are said to be “quite valuable,”

although the exact value is un-
known. The University has insur-
ed them for $5,000 each.

The portrait of Lee shows him as
a clean-shaven young man in the
uniform of a second lieutenant. It
is believed to have been painted
in 1831, shortly after his marriage,
by an artist known only as West.

The portrait of Mrs. Lee, great-
granddaughter of Martha Washing-
ton, was also painted by West. It
shows her as Mary Randolph Cus-
tis, the portrait used for the jacket
design on the book, “The Lady of
Arlington,” by Harnett T. Kane.
The Custis portrait bears the date
1848 and is by an artist known as
Stearns.

The paintings were bequeathed
to Washington and Lee by “Cap-
tain Bob’ Lee upon his death on
September 7, 1922. ‘The University
assumed ownership after the recent
death of Mrs. Lee. “Captain Bob”
received his law degree in 1892 and
served as a trustee from 1915 until
he died.

University Development Program—Alumni Fund

S OF JUNE 30, 1959, the University Development Program had been car-
A ried to seventeen out of forty-four areas, all of which had not com-
pleted their efforts. The total pledge of alumni, parents, and friends as of
this date was $1,182,839.90 Of this amount, alumni, thus far contacted,
have pledged $495,286.48.

Because of the area type organization, it is obvious not all the alumni
members of any one class have been contacted. These alumni in the areas
not yet covered are encouraged to wait until the program is conducted in
your area before making a contribution.

The following table is merely to depict the record by classes as of June

ATLANTA

The Atlanta chapter gave a most
successful luncheon on September
1 for Atlanta students presently at-
tending Washington and Lee, and
for freshmen from Georgia who are
enrolled this year. The luncheon
was attended by twenty-three alum-
ni, four students, and nine enter-
ing freshmen. Prospective freshmen
from the whole state were invited,
and those who attended came from
Augusta, Clayton, ‘Tallapoosa,
Rome, Griffin, and Atlanta.

Rodney Cook, *46, newly elected
member of the Alumni Associa-
tion’s Board of Trustees, addressed
the group and welcomed the fresh-
men. He reported to alumni on re-
cent changes at the school in both
the physical plant and the faculty
and administration.

Tentative meetings are sched-
uled as follows: a cocktail party in

OCTOBER 1959

the fall; a dinner meeting in Feb-
ruary, with a speaker from the
University; and a business meeting
in the spring. It is hoped to invite
prospective students for 1960-61 to
the February meeting.

WHEN THE AMERICAN Bar Associa-
tion held its annual meeting in Mi-
ami in August, Washington and
Lee alumni met together at the
Kenilworth hotel for a luncheon on
August 26. John W. Ball, ’32, chair-
man, presided, and alumni had
such a good time that they have
planned a repeat affair at the ABA
meeting next August in Washing-
ton, D. C.

Among the invited guests was
H. K. “Cy” Young, °17, former
alumni secretary who now resides
in Fort Lauderdale. He was asked

to name everybody and did so with-
out mistake, and in addition, gave
the class of each alumnus with only
slight prompting. Following his
remarkable exhibition of memory,
the group was welcomed by O. B.
McEwan, ’40, president of the
Florida Bar. Ross L. Malone, ’32,

04 WILLARD NEAL GRUBB is a patient

at Catawba hospital, Catawba, Virginia,
and would be glad to have any alumni in
the area as visitors. He has devoted his
life to teaching Latin and Greek, and stu-
dents in many walks of life are indebted
to him for his years of instruction. He is
now in his late seventies and his sight is
poor, but he has a splendid memory, par-
tarticularly about Washington and Lee
and its personalities at the turn of the
century. He is a loyal alumnus and _ has
exemplified the highest ideals of Washing-
ton and Lee for more than half a cen-
tury.

12 Dr. and Mrs. GordON L. GROOVER
both retired from government service on
June 30, 1959. He put in thirty years, and
she forty years. Dr. Groover was with the
Veterans’ Administration, after coming
to Washington from private practice in
Savannah, Georgia. Mrs. Groover, known
professionally as Mary-Agnes Brown, was
a lawyer with the Board of Veteran Ap-
peals. During World War II, she was dep-
uty to the Director of the WACs, later
was with General MacArthur as the WAC
staff director of the Southwest Pacific
area. The Groovers plan to enjoy their re-
tirement, with travel taking the number
one priority. They hope to visit South
America, Mexico, Europe, and to take a
trailer-camp trip to all the national
parks. Dr. and Mrs. Groover attended the
General Reunion last June, and they say
they hope to come back next year for
more of the same.

13 Dr. P. D. CONveRSE has had an
interesting time since his retirement in
1957 as professor of Marketing at the Uni-
versity of Illinois. He taught at San Jose
State College in the summer of 1958, and
at the University of Texas during the
second semester of 1958-59. He is now in
Europe, lecturing at various universities
on marketing, under the sponsorship of
the European Productivity Agency. Dur-
ing the fall term, he is in charge of the

12

course on marketing in the new Euro-
pean graduate schooi of bur!ness admin-
istration, Institute European d’Adminis-
tration Les Affaires, at Fontainebleau.
This is Dr. Converse’s forty-seventh year
of teaching. The Texas Bureau of Busi-
ness Research recently published two
monographs by Dr. Converse: ‘“The Be-
ginning of Marketing Thought in the
United States” and “Fifty Years of Market-
ing in Retrospect.”

PauL C. Burorp is again president of
Shenandoah Life Insurance Company. He
had resigned the post about four years ago
because of ill health. He served as pres-
ident of the company from i938 until
1956, when he became chairman of the
board. Headquarters are in Roanoke, Vir-
ginia.

/ 6 E. B. SwHuttz, after more than

twenty-five years of service with the Ten-
nessee Valley Authority, is retiring on
November 1, to be on the faculty of New
York State School of Industrial and La-
bor relations of Cornell University. He
will engage in a study of retirement poli-
cy and practices, made possible by a Ford
Foundation grant. He will be co-director
of the study, along with John McConnell,
dean of the school. Mr. Schultz has been
chief of the Labor Relations branch of
TVA for twenty-two years, and for the
past five years has been directing a study
of the retirement system.

25 Dick BEARD was one of twenty-nine

Alabama farm leaders who toured Euro-
pean farms during the summer. The trip
lasted three weeks and even extended into
Russia. Dick said, in his opinion, Russian
agriculture is far inferior to that of our
country, but if they had mechanization
equal to ours, the Soviets could out-pro-
duce us in five to ten years. The most
impressive factor he noted in his tour
was the vast amount of manpower work-
ing on farms. In some countries, he said
he saw thirty-five workers doing the job

done by two men on larger Alabama
farms. Holland had the most diversified
farming, he pointed out. Dick’s 250-acre
Glen Dale Farms near Trussville is con-
sidered one of the best organized and
managed in the United States. He raises
some of the best bee® in the world.

26 Dr. RoBert C. YATES, head of the

mathematics department at the College
of William and Mary, was a speaker at

tute” last July at Hampton Institute in
Hampton, Virginia. He addressed seventy-
three high school science teachers from
twelve Southern states and the District
of Columbia.

m ROBERT M. WHITE, I, ’39, widely-
known small town Missouri editor

and publisher, took over on August
3, 1959, as president and editor of
one of New York’s largest news-
papers, The Herald Tribune.

Bob White is a third-generation
newspaper man. His grandfather
and father before him_ published
and edited the Mexico Ledger in
Mexico, Missouri. After graduation
from Washington and Lee, Bob
joined the Kansas City staff of
United Press. During World War
Il, he was a member of the armed
forces, and was released as a lieu-
tenant colonel in public informa-
tion in 1945. He has been co-editor
and publisher of his family’s news-
paper since. From 1956-58 he was

special consultant to Marshall
Field, editor and publisher of the
Chicago Sun-Times.

Bob’s editorials won him the Sig-
ma Delta Chi Distinguished Service
Award in 1952. In 1958, he was
named ‘Missouri's outstanding
young newspaper man.” He is a
member of the board of directors
of the American Newspaper Pub-
lishers Association and of its Re-
search Institute, and is chairman
of the Associated Press nominating
committee.

His Missouri newspaper has a
circulation of 8,828 and thirty-four
fulltime employees. His New York
paper has a daily circulation of
355,466 and 527,000 on Sundays,
plus two thousand employees. But
as White sees it, a good small-town
newspaper editor should be a good
big-town editor as well. “I don’t
have any qualms, but I do have an
abiding respect for the size of the
job,” Bob said.

John Hay Whitney, principal
owner of the paper, and U.S. Am-
bassador to England, declared, “‘I
believe we have found the man
with the dynamic ideas and sound
newspaper background we _ have
been looking for. Bob White has
been editor of one of the finest
small daily newspapers in the na-
tion. I know that he will bring vig-
orous new leadership to The
Herald Tribune.”

three daughters, 10, g, and 4.

a thriving industrial village making barrel
staves for wooden oil barrel. Later, when
oil was placed in metal drums, Bacova’s
star waned. However, Malcolm hopes to
change that by attracting an industry
which might revitalize the local economic

thoroughbred horses were raised.
