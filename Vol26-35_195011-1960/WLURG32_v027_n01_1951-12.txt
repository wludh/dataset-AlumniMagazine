School Year Opens with 1044 Students

 

Orientation in a cool spot

The 203rd opening of Wash-
ington and Lee University, in a
year of war and world-wide ten-
sion, was singularly quiet and nor-
mal in tenor.

The opening week was sunny.
Rush week and fraternities took
precedent over the beginning of
classes, on September 21. Fresh-
men were displaying “beanies,”
and carefully keeping to the side-
walks. By the following Monday
college life was in full swing.
Weekdays became quiet and stu-
cious. Week-ends became gay and
wonderful.

The current world conditions,
however, were not without their ef-
fect on the students. The faculty
—and the students themselves—
have noticed a new feeling of se-
riousness of purpose upon the cam-
pus. Contrary to the condition last
February when each student felt
the next week might be his last be-
fore entering the service, General
Hershey’s liberal draft deferment
policy for college students has
coupled with a settling of the emo-
tions to produce a hard working
student body.

Dean of Students Frank J. Gil-

liam says he is “immensely heart-

4.

ened” by both the large enrollment
and the attitude of this year’s un-
dergraduates. Last winter it was
feared by University officials that
the enrollment for this year would
drop far below normal. But there
are only twelve fewer freshmen on
campus this session than last. The
total enrollment, 1044, is only 103
beneath that of last year’s, 1147.
Enough students had a faith in

tea

the future and a determination to
continue their education so that
the number paying the advance
registration fee for this session was
only one less than the preceding
year.

Included among the 1044 stu-
dents present this year are men
from thirty-four states, the District
of Columbia, and nine territories
and foreign countries. Virginia
leads the list with 249 students
present. New York has 90, West
Virginia 77, Maryland 70, and
Pennsylvania has 65 students on
campus. ‘l'wo students are from
Maine and even far away Cali-
fornia sent four students to Wash-
ington and Lee this year. Among
the territories and foreign coun-
tries five students are from Hawaii,
three from Mexico, two from Eng-
land and Puerto Rico. Brazil, Den-
mark, France, Germany, and Vene-
zuela, have one student each on
campus. In addition there is one
student attending the University
whose parents recently fled from
Czechoslovakia.

An important reason for the un-
expected high enrollment this year

 

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

is the high average made by the
students on the selective service
board’s tests recently given to aid
in determining those eligible to
continue their education before
going into the service. Unofficial
records show that only two Wash-
ington and Lee students failed to
make the qualifying score. This is
an average of only .2 per cent fail-
ing as compared to a national col-

legiate average of 37 per cent fail-
ures. University officials state they
believe this is direct proof that
high entrance requirements and
the College Board examination pre-
requisite are paying off.

Three other reasons have been
advanced for the large number of
students present. The liberal pol-
icy followed by most of the coun-
try’s boards in regard to college

students prior to their entering

couraged many old _ students

enrolled in the course a sense

students has resulted in relatively
little loss in the upper classes. As
yet the induction age hasn’t been
lowered sufficiently to affect many

as

freshmen. The establishment of the
new ROTC unit (covered in an-
other article in this issue) has en-

to

return, and has given freshmen

of

 

94 Sons of Alumni Currently Enrolled

There are 94 sons of alumni now enrolled as students in the University; 23 of whom are in their first year
at Washington and Lee. The classes represented by alumni fathers cover a period from 1907 to 1931, the

class of 1925, with 15 sons, leading.

security concerning their career.

The students themselves put
forth the reasons for the new seri-
ousness of purpose. Says one stu-
dent, “You have an added incentive
to work when you know that be-
ing in the upper half of your class
may determine whether you can
return to college next year or
whether you go into the service.”

Another states, “I fully intend
to enter the service eventually.
However, Id like to finish college
first. Just thinking about this gives
you a feeling that you’d better
grow up and get to work.”

A third student says, “When
you feel for awhile that you may
not be able to finish college, you
suddenly realise just how impor-
tant an education really is.”

The Korean war has not affected
the age of the student body as yet.
Only three Korean veterans are
now on campus. But University
officials feel that next year, or the
year to follow, may bring a small
influx of veterans to the school.

“Our experience with the vet-
erans during the years 1945-
1950,” says Dean Gilliam, “indi-
cates that the new veterans will be
a welcome addition to our campus.
For the most part they are mature,
serious students, with a construc-
tive and sobering influence upon
the student body.”

But even the new “seriousness
of purpose,” the war tension, or
an unpredictable future, hasn’t
changed the Washington and Lee
campus life. Students spend the
days and nights engaging in ac-
tivities and feverishly “boning” for
the next test, the one which is al-
ways around the corner no matter
what the day. The weekends find
the “Minks” with the largest col-
lection of beautiful women to be
found on any campus.

The 1951-1952 session of
Washington and Lee is off to a
good start, and concerning the new
school year Dean Gilliam says,
“Barring all-out war, we are headed
for a good year of productive
work, with a student body of re-
markably fine spirit.”

MACE: A Symbol of Authority

A mace is a staff traditionally
used as a symbol of authority. The
British houses of parliament, cer-
tain municipalities and corpora-
tions, and distinguished univer-
sities have long used the mace. It
is carried in procession before the
officials and then placed in rest to
denote the fact that (in this in-
stance ) the official University is in
session.

The Washington and Lee mace
was created in 1951. The carving
is the work of Miss Mary Barclay,
of Lexington, widely known for her
distinguished sculpture in wood.
She and her family have for many
years been connected with this uni-
versity. The mace was designed by
Professor Marion Junkin, ’27, head
of the department of Fine Arts.

The wood from which the mace
is carved is walnut. It was origi-
nally a beam in the old Lexington
town fire house (once the home of
Matthew White, Washington Col-
lege, 1885). The wood is about
150 years old.

The beam was first turned at
the Virginia Craft House at Har-
risonburg, of which Carlyle Lynch,
32, is director, and then the staff
and head were separately carved.
The length of the mace is four
feet. Its head, one foot long, is cut
in the shape of an urn and is nine
inches across at its widest point.

On each side of the head the
Washington and Lee coat of arms
is carved, with its scroll and mot-
to, non incautus futuri, which is
translated, “Not unmindful of the
future,” under the coat of arms.
On top of the mace are a crown
and a bird, both parts of the Uni-
versity crest.

The painting of the mace was
done by Professor Junkin: the
crown, bird and scroll in gold leaf,
and the coat of arms in silver, blue,
and red. The remainder of the mace
is waxed and highly polished.

Professor Charles P. Light, mar-
shal of the University, carries the
mace before the officials and fac-
ulty members when in procession.

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

They're in the Army Now

Alumni returning to the Wash-
ington and Lee campus this year
will be amazed. Dotting the tradi-
tionally civilian University grounds
will be students in army uniform.
If the alumnus looks at the ath-
letic field he will be apt to see
squads of students performing
close-order drill, and if he visits
the school on the right afternoon
he will see a full-fledged Washing-
ton and Lee Corps parade. On Sat-
urday nights he will hear students
singing Sound off and Yowre In
the Army Now.

For the first time in 202 years
Washington and Lee has an efh-
cient complete four year course in
ROTC, the Army’s Reserve Of-
ficer’s Training Corps.

Actually it isn’t the first time
the Army has invaded Washington
and Lee. The school had an ROTC
unit during the 1917-1918 session.
This was dropped the following
year and The Student’s Army
Training Corps came into being.
This also lasted only one year.
With the ending of World War I
and the return to normalcy, Wash-
ington and Lee decided it simply
wasn’t a military minded institu-
tion.

But last year, due to the exist-
ing world tension, it was thought
advisable by the University off-
cials to attempt to bring the ROTC
course to Washington and Lee. An
application was presented to the
War Department, and approved.
This year the unit is in full oper-
ation with an allowance of govern-
ment training aids and a cadre of
regular Army officers and enlisted
men assigned to supervise the
training.

Lt. Colonel Richard W. Jones,
a graduate of St. John’s College
of Brooklyn, is Professor of Mili-
tary Science and Tactics. He re-
ceived his commission in 1926
and served in the Southwest Pa-
cific during World War II. Lt.
Colonel John G. Bowes and Cap-

By J. W. BENJAMIN, JR., 754

 

tain George L. Brashears assist
Colonel Jones. Four Sergeants have
been detailed by the Army to do
the administrative work and serve
as assistant instructors.

In keeping with current prac-
tices at the Army’s own Service
Schools, the ROTC makes maxi-
mum utilization of graphic training
aids, all manner of charts and dem-
onstration equipment, and visual
education methods.

The unit here is equipped with
an auditorium type 16mm motion
picture projector, a large Bal-Op-
tican slide and opaque projector,
a Vu-Graph for visual slides, and
a powerful 2x2 slide projector for
film-strip projection.

Training films and_film-strips
from the Army’s extensive library
at Fort Meade covering a host of
general military subjects are drawn
as required for the individual in-
struction. Visual-cast slides, deal-
ing with the technical subjects of
the course, are sometimes prepared
by the Unit’s instructors here but
most of them are furnished directly
by the Transportation School at
Fort Eustis, Virginia.

Outdoor assistance is rendered

the drillmaster by a complete two-
speaker public address system,
equipped with turntable for march
music when the ROTC band is not
itself practicing or drilling on the
field. ‘Through the cooperation of
the PMS&T, this set has been ex-
tensively used by the University,
at Freshman Camp and at home
football games. The projectors, set
up in the Reid Hall ROTC class-
room where a large screen has
been installed, are likewise avail-
able for other departments’ use
and have been used by them on a
number of occasions.

At the present there are 263
first year basic and 25 second year
basic students. There are 25 stu-
dents in the first year advanced
course. Advanced students receive
credit for prior work in military
schools and high school ROTC
units.

The Transportation Corps was
selected as Washington and Lee’s
branch of service for three primary
reasons. The small student body,
the relatively small amount of
equipment and ground necessary
for training, and Washington and
Lee’s proven reputation as a pro-
ducer of graduates skilled in ad-
ministrative business planning and
leadership.

The first two years, the basic
course, provide indoctrination in
military subjects common to all
branches of service. They include:
an introduction to Military Science,
organization, military policy, evo-
lution of warfare, personnel man-
agement, military psychology, and
other related subjects. The second
year of the basic course includes
an introduction into logistics. A
third of the training time is de-
voted to the development of leader-
ship through drill and the exercise
of command.

The third and fourth years delve
into military transportation tech-
niques in all phases; railway, high-
Way port, and over-sea supply. Be-
tween the third and fourth years,
students attend a six weeks sum-
mer encampment at the Army’s
Transportation center, Fort Eus-
tis, Virginia.

Academic credit is given at the
rate of two hours per year for the
basic course, and four hours per
vear for the advanced course. Ad-
vanced students receive monetary
allowance of $.90 per day, approx-
imately $27 per month. All uni-
forms, books, and training mate-
rials are furnished by the Army.

Students are required to wear
uniform only when attending mili-
tary classes or in actual training.
All military standards of discipline
and courtesy are observed during
these periods.

The Washington and Lee Bat-
talion is organized into three com-
panies, a marching band, and
a headquarters detachment. Ad-
vanced students are alternating in
the responsible positions, which
range from corporal up to lieuten-
ant colonel, the battalion com-
mander.

‘Training includes two full-dress
parades monthly, and also range
firing. The ROTC Department is
now in the process of obtaining and
developing range facilities.

Many activities in connection
with the military program are
either now underway or planned
for the future. Most important is

8

an ROTC marching band which
has been organized from the stu-
dent body under the direction of
Colonel Bowes. Dave Comegy is
the student director. A full com-
plement of instruments has been
obtained from the Army.

It is hoped that the school will
have a rifle team and a schedule is
now being tentatively arranged
with other ROTC schools.

Two military honor organiza-
tions will be formed during the
year; Scabbard and Blade, and the
Washington and Lee Order of
Military Merit. A student chapter
of the world-wide organization, Na-
tional Defense Transportation As-
sociation, is being organized.

One of the most interesting ac-
tivities to emerge from the new
military set-up is a model railroad
club, The Generals’ Short Line
Railroad. Complete equipment for
the building of a large scale-model
railway has been received by the
military department from_ the
Army, and the construction work
is now in process. These activities
will be covered in a future issue of
this magazine.

Students enrolled in the ROTC
under the presidentially determined
quota are deferred from the draft
until the completion of their col-
lege work, provided they are in
good standing both in ROTC and
academic work. When a student
registers for the ROTC he must
first agree to accept a commission
in the Army, if offered, upon grad-
uation from college, and thereafter
to perform twenty-four months
military service as a commissioned
officer.

Colonel Jones, the Professor of
Military Science and Tactics, says
he finds Washington and Lee an
ideal environment for a technical
branch training center. No Vir-
ginia Military Institute facilities
are used although Washington and
Lee maintains an excellent liaison
with the VMI ROTC staff.

“We take our work seriously,’
says Colonel Jones, “Young Amer-
icans selected for commissions

9

must have the integrity to lead
troops in ground combat. Among
the fundamentals of leadership we
are attempting to develop here are
those of character, initiative, intel-
ligence, and energetic alertness. At
Washington and Lee we _ have
found some exceptionally fine ma-
terial in which to further develop
these traits.”

“Among the students now in
my classes,” Colonel Jones con-
tinues, “may easily be found some
who will eventually serve under
me, or even lead my son into battle.
With that in mind we cannot afford
to be lax. I take my job, and my
responsibility, seriously.”

Dean of Students Frank J. Gil-
liam says, “I am amazed at the
simplicity and efficiency of the
ROTC program. It has fitted into
our schedule without a hitch.”

And actually, returning alumni
will hardly be aware that they are
walking among hundreds of future
United States Army Officers. The
alumnus may be aware that there
is a new feeling of seriousness of
purpose among the students. But
Washington and Lee University,
for all intents and purposes, is still
a civilian institution.

Nation's Radio Executives on Campus

Leaders of the nation’s radio
and television industry gathered
at Washington and Lee University
November 12 to mark the dedica-
tion of the Alfred I. duPont Foun-
dation awards to purposes of edu-
cation.

Highlighting the ceremony,
which was attended by heads of the
four major networks and important
communications figures, was the
transfer of administration of the
du Pont awards to Washington and
Lee University. In addition, three
annual scholarships in the field of
communications were created.

O. W. Riegel, director of the
Lee Memorial Journalism Foun-
dation at Washington and Lee,
was named Curator of the awards,
which have been granted for dis-
tinguished public service in radio
and television since 1942.

Among the visitors were Mrs.
Jessie Ball duPont, widow of the
famed scientist and founder of the

awards, and representatives of the
broadcasting industry who were:
Wayne Coy, chairman of the Fed-
eral Communications Commission;
Joseph H. McConnell, president of
the National Broadcasting Com-
pany; Dr. Frank Stanton, president
of the Columbia Broadcasting
Company, and Frank White, presi-
dent of the Mutual Broadcasting
System.

Dr. Francis P. Gaines, president
of Washington and Lee University,
accepted responsibility for adminis-
tration of the annual awards on be-
half of the University, long a leader
in journalistic and communications
education.

Washington and Lee was the
first institution in the world to offer
journalistic instruction at the col-
lege level, during the presidency
of General Robert E. Lee. It was
chosen to supervise the adminis-
tration of the duPont awards, ac-
cording to the Alfred I. duPont

Foundation, because of its “tradi-
tionally sound and universally rec-
ognized principles of education.”

Under the new scholarship plan,
winning radio and television sta-
tions and commentators may use
the award of $1000 to establish
scholarships or fellowships in com-
munications. The award winners
may select the student and the
university, subject only to certain
eligibility requirements and a re-
view by the advisory institution. In
some instances, the scholarship’s
value can be increased to cover all
educational expenses from one to
four years.

Other important figures in the
radio and television field who at-
tended the dedication were:

Commander Fanning M. Hearon
is back on active duty in the Navy
as Officer-in-Charge of the Combat
Camera Group of the Pacific Fleet.
This picture of Hearon and “Danny
Boy,” a South Korean boy adopted
by the Marine Corps, was taken at
the Korean air station headquarters
of the First Marine Air Wing.

It is Hearon’s job to direct the ac-
tivities of the several units of the
Combat Camera Group in making
of motion and still pictures of the
Navy’s combat action and opera-
tions. The Group has been in the
Korean zone since the beginning of
hostilities.

Operating bases are maintained

in Korea, Tokyo, the Philippines,
Guam, Pearl Harbor and San
Diego. The material photographed
by the Group is used in newsreels,
documentary motion pictures, on
television, and in magazines and
newspapers.

Commander Hearon volunteered
for active duty when the Korean
war began in June 1950. At the
time he was living on his “Run-
ning Ridge Ranch” at Ojai, Cali-
fornia. After being released to
inactive duty after the last war,
Hearon was with RKO Pathe in
New York. His last assignment
during his last tour of duty was as
liaison officer on the Bikini tests.

Dr. Cluxton

All Dr. Harley E. Cluxton, Jr.,
A.B., ’37, has to do these days is
to organize the world’s intense ef-
fort to learn to use one of its
newest and most powerful weap-
ons.

It is not the atomic or hydrogen
bomb, or a rocket, or a jet fighter—
not a weapon of death at all, in
fact, but the latest medicine’s har-
mone, known in headline short-
hand as ACTH.

In its impact on medicine,
ACTH is in the same category
with such epochmaking discoveries
as anesthesia and asepsis, which
opened the field to modern surgery
and the sulfa drugs and antibiotics,
which gave us control of infectious
disease.

ACTH has been much _ pub-
licized for its power to relieve
chronic diseases such as arthritis
and rheumatic fever, psoriasis, lup-
us erythematosus, and other condi-
tions as ugly as their names. For
many of them medicine has hither-
to had no really effective weapon.

But ACTH is much more than
that. It is the first clue, in many
medical minds, to the basic mech-
anism which determines whether
we are to be sick or well, and, if
sick, what form the disease will

Explores Uses of ACTH

take and why. In actual use, it
seems to drop a sort of “chemical
curtain” between the cells and
organs of the body and any sort
of injury, whether a blow or a
burn, or a bacterium, or a metal-
lic poison, or snake venom.

It does not kill the germ or cure
the disease as the antibiotic does;
instead it protects the cells from
the consequences, the inflammation
and the pain, which are the symp-
toms. It is regarded to exercise
tremendous influences on the whole
course of medical education and
the practice of medicine; but that

 

Dr. Harley E. Cluxton, Jr., ’37

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

 

will not happen until medical men
have ferretted out its peculiarities
and learned how and when and in
what dosage to use it. And that
brings us to Harley Cluxton, the
35-year-old director of medical re-
search for Armour Laboratories in
Chicago.

Dr. Cluxton received his A.B.
degree from Washington and Lee
University in 1937, where he was
elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He re-
ceived his M.D. degree from the
Johns Hopkins Medical School in
1941. He did special work in path-
ology at Vanderbilt University
Medical School in 1939, and also
special work in internal medicine
at Harvard Medical School in
1940. He interned at the Baltimore
City Hospitals. Following the com-
pletion of his internship, he entered
the Mayo Clinic as a fellow in in-
ternal medicine in 1942, and re-
mained there until 1944 at which
time he entered the armed services.

Following the completion of his
Medical Field Service course at
Carlisle, Pennsylvania, he was sta-
tioned at the Army and Navy Gen-
eral Hospital, Hot Springs, Ar-
kansas, where for one year he was
in the rheumatic disease section and
was for two years chief of the gen-

11

eral medical section. Major Clux-
ton received the Unit Citation
award and also the Army Commen-
dation Ribbon for meritorious ser-
vice. After completing his tour of
duty in the army, in July, 1947,
he went back to the Mayo Clinic
where he was awarded the Master
of Science degree in medicine, by
the University of Minnesota and
the Mayo Clinic, in 1949.

Dr. Cluxton remained at the
Mayo Clinic until February, 1949,
at which time he opened his office
for the practice of internal medicine
in Savannah, Georgia, and _ prac-
ticed until October, 1950, at which
time he assumed the position of Di-
rector of Medical Research for the
Armour Laboratories, Chicago, II-
linois.

Dr. Cluxton is a member of the

following professional organiza-
tions: The American Medical As-
sociation; “The Association for the
Study of Internal Secretions; The
American Diabetes Association;
The American Rheumatism As-
sociation; The New York Academy
of Sciences; Diplomat of the Amer-
ican Board of Internal Medicine.
He has recently returned from
Europe where he attended and
lectured at Paris, France, Geneva,
Switzerland, and attended and lec-
tured at the Second International
European Congress on Rheuma-
tism at Barcelona, Spain.

He was married to Miss Eliza-
beth Parsons King in 1940 and
they have two children; Betsy, 8,
and Harley, III, 5. Home address:

Robert Spahr Receives Award

Robert Hoover Spahr, B.S. ’09,
received the James H. McGraw
Award in Technical Education
from the Technical Institute Divi-
sion of the American Society for
Ingineering Education in June
1951. The award was inaugurated
only a year ago, and this is the
second time it has been presented.
The presentation read as follows:

“To Robert Hoover Spahr for
his outstanding contributions to
technical institute education; for
the stimulus which was _ provided
by his authorship of the technical
institute section of the Report of
the Investigation of Engineering
Education, completed in 1929
under the direction of the late Wil-
liam E. Wickenden; for the en-
viable example of sound curriculum
development and instructional su-
pervision which has characterized
the General Motors Institute for
more than twenty years under his
gvood-natured and effective leader-
ship; for his stimulating participa-
tion in a wide variety of technical
education activities of both a na-

12

 

Robert Hoover Spahr, ’09

tional and international  signifi-
cance.”

Mr. Spahr, who retired in 1950
as Administrative Chairman of Co-
operative Engineering and Dealer
Cooperative Programs at General
Motors Institute, received the de-
gree of Bachelor of Science from

Trustees Meet

The University Board of Trus-
tees held its fall meeting on the
campus on October 12, with
the following members present:
Herbert Fitzpatrick, Clarence A.
Avery, W. Lapsley Carson, James
R. Caskie, Christopher T. Chenery,
Homer A. Holt, Dr. Morrison Hut-
cheson, John N. Thomas and
Randolph ‘Tucker.

The Board granted a cost-of-
living salary increase of $300 to
all full-time faculty members and
salary increases of varying amounts
to members of the administrative
and maintenance staffs. All in-
creases effective as of November 1.

The trustees said several factors
made the modest salary increases
possible. First, the unexpected nor-
mal enrollment this fall, and sec-
ond, a substantial gift to the uni-
versity last spring by Mrs. Jessie
Ball duPont, long a benefactress
of the school.

Dr. Gaines cited three reasons
for Washington and Lee’s good
enrollment picture. Students made
an exceptional showing in the na-
tional draft board tests given last
spring. In addition, improvement
in world conditions and the estab-
lishment of an Army ROTC unit
on the campus had beneficial re-
sults.

Mr. Christopher T. Chenery,
09, invited the Board and _ the
Washington and Lee faculty to be
his guests at a reception and dinner
on January 18, the date of the next
regular meeting of the Board.

 

Washington and Lee University in
1909 and his Master of Science
from the University of Kentucky in
1912. He did further graduate
work at the University of Ken-
tucky and at the University of Chi-
cago.

From 1929 until he retired in
1950, Mr. Spahr was a member
of the administrative staff of Gen-
eral Motors Institute. Since his re-
tirement he has been living in
Smithsburg, Maryland.

The 1951 Edition of the Generals

The 1951 edition of the Wash-
ington and Lee Generals didn’t
fare as well in the won-lost column
as last year’s Southern Conference
champions, but they made history.
For the first time in the annals of
Washington and Lee football the
Big Blue defeated all three of their
big rivals in one year. Virginia was
upset 42-14, West Virginia was
vanquished 34-0, and VPI was
tromped 60-0. In each case it was
the largest score rolled up by the
Generals in the history of the riy-
alry.

Led by Coach George Barclay,
All-Southern Conference quarter-
back Gil Bocetti, and end Bob
Thomas, the Generals played what
was possibly the roughest schedule
in the school’s history. ‘They were
swift lightning on offense, one
of the nation’s leaders in pass de-
fense, but weak on stopping ground
attacks. Taking all things into con-
sideration local fans consider this
year’s eleven one of the best the
University has produced, and the
season one of the most successful.

FURMAN

The Generals opened the 751
season with a convincing 25-7 vic-

16

tory over the Purple Hurricane of
Furman. Quarterback Gil Bocetti,
completing eight of his last ten
passes, accounted for two of the
Generals’ touchdowns by heaves to
ends Dave Hedge and ‘Talbot
Trammell. Wes Abrams and Jack
Garst accounted for the other
two touchdowns with short runs.
Thomas kicked the extra point.

Furman scored in the third quar-
ter when Pedrick plunged from the
four after a sustained drive.

MARYLAND

The University of Maryland
jumped to a quick 14-0 lead in
the opening minutes of the game,
and went on from there to humble
the Generals 54-14. Broyles drop-
ped a punt with only two minutes
of the game gone, and Pete
Ladygo, Terp guard, fell on the
ball across the goal for the first
score. Six minutes later a 14-yard
pass from Decker to Lindsey gave
the Terps a two-touchdown lead.

Fullerton scored on a _ pitchout
early in the second quarter, and
Modzelewski bucked over from the
one shortly before the half ended.
The hapless Generals, who had
an acute case of fumbleitis through-

out the game, managed to capital-
ize on a Terp fumble midway in
the third quarter, tackle Rollo
‘Thompson recovering. Gil Bocetti,
out with a bruised knee, made one
of four appearances during the af-
ternoon to crash over from the
two. Jay Handlan converted. Mary-
land led at the half 27-7.

Early in the second half an in-
terference penalty on an_ inter-
cepted pass gave the ball to Mary-
land on the Washington and Lee
11. Modzelewski ran it over. Fol-
lowing this the Big Blue opened
up like a sieve and the Terps
poured through three more scores.
Ray Leister tossed to Bob Thomas
on a 70-yard pass play for the
other Washington and Lee score.
Behind their 205-pound line the
Maryland backs rolled up a total
gain of 362 yards rushing, to the
Generals’ 27. Bocetti and Waters
were sidelined because of injuries.

WEST VIRGINIA

Bouncing back from the Mary-
land landslide, the Generals beat
the West Virginia Mountaineers
34-0. Halfback Jack Garst cli-
maxed a 99-yard drive in the first
quarter by receiving a 21-yard pass

THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE

from Bocetti for the first score.
Ray Leister’s 17-yard run and 40-
yard pass to Tal Trammell, set
up the scoring play.

Broyles scored twice in the sec-
ond quarter on runs of one and
49 yards. A 3l-yard Bocetti to
Thomas pass set up the first of
these. Just before the half Tram-
mell snared a 47-yard pass from
Bocetti and drove to the one foot
line. Bocetti bucked over for a
score.

Following a Trammell intercep-
tion in the fourth quarter, Bocetti
pitched 35 yards to end Bob
Thomas for the final W. and L.
score. Jay Handlan converted four
times.

The Mountaineers threatened
only once, in the fourth quarter.
Sweeny returned a kickoff 53 yards
and broke away on the next play
for 11 more, placing the ball on
the Generals’ 34. But these gains
were nullified by an intercepted
pass.

‘The Generals completed 10 of
16 passes, and picked up 143 yards
with their running attack. The re-
turn to action of both Bocetti and
Waters aided the Washington and
Lee cause considerably.

VIRGINIA

After thirteen long years the
Big Blue finally had its feast as
the underdog Generals gobbled up
the University of Virginia 42-14.

Playing almost perfection foot-
ball, the Washington and Lee ma-
chine hit paydirt six times. A short
punt by Virginia’s Hal Hoak went
out of bounds on their own 28 early
in the first quarter. Broyles broke
loose to the nine and Bocetti passed
to Thomas for the score.

Virginia bounced back imme-
diately. Jimmy Ashwell grabbed
the kickoff following the Generals’
score, and dashed 95 yards to tie
up the game. But this was the Gen-
erals’ day. Runs by Garst, Broyles,
and Bolt set up the next touch-
down, and with four minutes left
in the quarter Bocetti passed to
‘Thomas on a 38-yard scoring play.

Karly in the second quarter
Thomas took a deceptive hand-off
from Bocetti to score from eight
yards out. With only seconds left
in the half Broyles broke into the
clear for a 77-yard touchdown gal-
lop. Washington and Lee led at
the half, 28-7

Virginia rallied momentarily in
the third quarter when Bob Pate
raced 48 yards to score. But the
fourth quarter found the Generals
on the march again. Bocetti to
Thomas accounted for a 62-yard
pass play which carried the ball to
the Virginia two. Dave Hedge
pounced on Abram’s fumble over
the goal line. When the Big Blue
got their hands on the ball again
they marched 95 yards to score.
Ciro Barcellona’s 63-yard run cli-
maxed the drive. Broyles broke
through from the one for the score.
Jay Handlan booted six for six in
a perfect afternoon.

As a result of this game, Lex-
ington’s outstanding and
memorable in years, quarterback
Gil Bocetti was picked by the
Richmond Times-Dispatch as the
“back of the week” for the second
time this year. Bob Thomas took
over the lead in Southern Confer-
ence scoring, and Randy Broyles
placed fifth.

MIAMI

Washington and Lee was simply
swept off its feet when it met the
Hurricane of Miami University in
the Orange Bowl. The final score
was 32-12, favor of Miami.

The Generals fumbled twice in
the opening minute of the game
and Miami grabbed the second
one on the W. and L. 11. Melear
scored on a quarterback sneak. The
Generals bounced back to drive
all the way down the field. Bocetti
plunged from the one for the score.
But late in the second quarter the
Hurricane hammered a second one
across to grab a 13-6 halftime lead.

The game was never in doubt
in the second half as Miami racked
up three more touchdowns. ‘Tram-
mell scored the second Washington

runback of an intercepted pass.

Following a sluggish and score-

The Generals handed the hap-

trounced them, 60-0. All nine
Washington and Lee scores were
made via the ground.

Moody drove over from the
two to climax the first General
drive of 80 yards. Two minutes
later Broyles crashed from the two
for the second score. Following a
long Leister to Hedge pass, Leister
cracked the Gobbler line from the
three. Bill Scott intercepted a Tech
pass and lateralled to Bay Arnold
to complete the first period scoring.

The Generals scored only once
in the second quarter, when Bo-
cetti went ten yards for a touch-
down. Early in the third quarter
Bocetti threw a long pass to
Thomas to set up a score, and
then drove over from the two.
Wes Abrams, Landis, and Connie
Flanders finished the marathon
scoring parade, going over with
short line bucks. Bob Lafferty
kicked four extra points. Bocetti
ran two over.

The Generals ground out 394
yards while holding the Techmen
to only 76.

TENNESSEE

The Generals stepped out of
their class when they met the
high flying Tennessee Volunteers.
The nation’s top ranking team
handed the Generals their worst
defeat of the season by rolling up
an easy, 60-14, victory.

Two Bocetti to Thomas passes
accounted for the W. and L.

18

scores. The first was an 11-yard
pass play in the second quarter.
The second, good for 35 yards, oc-
curred late in the fourth quarter.
The Volunteers, led by highly
touted Hank Lauricella and his
replacement, Harold Payne, led at
the half, 35-7.

Washington and Lee players de-
scribed the Tennessee eleven as a
perfection team, “loaded with re-
serves, and talent.” Only bright
spot of the afternoon for the bruised
and battered Big Blue were the
Bocetti scoring passes. It was the
first time any team had _ scored
against the Vols through the air.

Lauricella carred the ball six
times during the afternoon, aver-
aged 19 yards per trip, scored
two touchdowns.

LOUISVILLE

The University of Louisville
struck twice with lightning speed,
bottled up the Washington and
Lee offense, and upset the visit-
ing Lexingtonians, 14-7.

The Cardinals opened the scor-
ing early in the first period when
Johnny Unitas stunned the Gen-
erals with a long pass from his
own 46. Babe Ray pulled it in on
the W. and L. 20 and romped into
the end zone. The Generals con-
trolled the play the remainder of
the half, driving to the 12, 8, and
14-yard lines. But they didn’t have
a scoring punch.

Jack Williams, Louisville full-
back, grabbed the second half kick-
off on his own four-yard line and
ran it all the way. The Generals
had charge of the game from then
on, but could only cross the final
stripe once. Broyles went ten to
score on a pitch-out from Bocetti.

RICHMOND

The Generals’ exhibition against
the University of Richmond wasn’t
its best of the season, but the Big
Blue had no trouble in racking up
a 39-7 victory.

Bocetti climaxed a_ brilliantly
engineered 73-yard drive by a

pitch-out to Randy Broyles for a
14-yard scoring play. A few min-
utes later Barcellona broke through
for a 63-yard touchdown jaunt.
Early in the second quarter, Rich-
mond’s Bobby ‘Tyler connected
with Joe Purinai on a scoring play
which covered 45 yards. A Bo-
cetti to Trammell pass gave the
Generals a 19-7 half-time lead.

In the third quarter, Dave
Waters intercepted a spider pass,
and ran it back 73 yards. Wes
Abrams went 15 yards through
the line for the score. Barcellona
stepped off 55 yards for his sec-
ond touchdown.

On the final play of the game
freshman end DeBeer, in his first
play in intercollegiate football, in-
tercepted a pass and ran it back
to score.

Gil Bocetti was removed from
the game two minutes prior to the
final gun, and received a stand-
ing ovation from the crowd of
7,000 that shook the bleachers. He
was sent back in for the final extra
point but the one and only point
after touchdown kick of his col-
legiate career was low. Bocetti was

Betore Inflation Struck Football

Rummaging through some old
papers a short time ago, John L.
Campbell, A.B. ’09; LL.B. 711,
came upon a wrinkled sheet dated
1906, and on closer examination
found it was signed by himself as
manager of the Washington and
Lee University football team 1906.

Forty-five years after they were
compiled, the figures in the report
seemed hard to believe. To present
W. and L. athletic officials, strug-
eling to hold down the high cost
of football, discovery of the old
report was like a voice from the
forgotten past.

For the entire season of 1906,
disbursements totaled $1411.76!
Uniforms for the entire team, for
example, and “lime, etc.” for the
playing field—entered in the re-
port as one item—cost only $157.-
61. Today that sum is_ hardly
enough to fully equip one player.

Biggest item of expense for the
1906 season was the salary and
board of Coach R. R. “Buster”
Brown—$556. Among the other
entries were “guarantees, hotel bills
and loss on trips, $513.25”; “tele-

gee

phone, telegraph and advertising,
$18.40”; and “printing, $17.25.”

At the end of the season, in sub-
mitting his report, the manager
turned over to the University the
balance to his credit amounting to
$2.00.

Despite its shoe-string budget
the Washington and Lee team of
1906, captained by H. M. Moo-
maw, now a Roanoke, Virginia, at-
torney, enjoyed a highly successful
season. The Generals won four
games, lost one and tied one.

Washington and Lee opened its
season by defeating Augusta Mili-
tary Academy 10-0 (touchdowns
counted five points in those days)
and closed out the year with a
rousing 18-0 victory over the Uni-
versity of Maryland, rated among
the top teams in the nation then.

The two other W. and L. wins
were at the expense of St. John’s
College and Randolph-Macon Col-
lege. The single loss for the Blue
and White was to Georgetown
University by a one-point margin,
6 to 5. The Generals tied North
Carolina State that year, 4-4, with

both teams scoring on a field goal.
Even with a winning team the
Generals of 1906 were unable to
draw the large crowds from miles
around that witness W. and L.
gridiron contests today. Gate re-
ceipts for the 1906 season totalled
only $110.37. Season tickets from
professors amounted to $10. The
bulk of operating revenue came
from the Athletic Association.
Members of the team, in addi-
tion to Captain Moomaw, were C.
B. and C. F. Bagley, both deceased;
C. William Streit, now president
of the Southern Cement Co., Bir-
mingham, Alabama; C. S. “Pat”
Osbourn, in the life insurance busi-
ness in New York City; Donnell C.
Dinges, Alexandria, Tennessee; E.
A. C. Hoge, general manager of
the Hoge Construction Co., Cin-
cinnati, Ohio; Hiram A. Whitting-

ceased; E. L. “Dutch” Alderson,
Houston, Texas, engineer; John
Izard, deceased; T. O. Bagley, Fay-
