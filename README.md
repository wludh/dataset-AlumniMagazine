# Alumni Magazine Data Set

## Description

This dataset is derived from the Alumni Magazine of Washington and Lee University.  The first issue was published in 1924. We created this dataset using [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to OCR the .tifs of each page then combined the pages of each issue into one text file. These issue level files are organized in folders by decade.  The number of issues in each volume varies. Each folder and and file name include the Volume, Issue, Year, and Month/Season.  

These files are intended for textual analysis and not as a stand-in for the scanned copies to be read cover to cover. If you'd like to read the issues and see the photographs, please go to the [The Washington and Lee University Alumni Magazine online collection](https://dspace.wlu.edu/handle/11021/34868) in the [Digital Archive](https://dspace.wlu.edu/).
