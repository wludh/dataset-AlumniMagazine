From the Alumni President

Many Thanks

Let me begin with congratulations to John Elrod on being named the 22nd presi-
dent of Washington and Lee. John has already made many contributions to W&L as a
professor of philosophy, as vice president of academic affairs, and as dean of the col-
lege. Many of you alumni also know John’s wife, Mimi,
through her work with Special Programs and the Alumni
College. We look forward to her new role in the life of
Washington and Lee—and I’m sure we will be hearing
more from John in the months ahead.

As the end of another academic year draws near, |
want to take this opportunity to thank the many volun-

 

 

teers who have supported Washington and Lee’s various
alumni programs. As I write this, we have just completed
what is traditionally a busy season, with almost 40 R.E.
Lee birthday celebrations and/or Washington’s Birthday-
related events held around the country. Many thanks to
those of you who attended these events and especially to
the event organizers and hosts. It is through these and
similar activities that we can help to keep Washington and Lee in the minds of alum-
ni, prospective students, and friends of the University throughout the country.

We have also recently concluded another year of work with the Alumni Admissions
Program. This year, some 410 committee members in 98 cities and regions conducted
905 interviews with high school seniors who have applied for admission to W&L. Bill
Hartog and his admissions staff comment regularly on the tremendous value this
process adds to our ability to identify and attract top students to the University.

With the help of alumni in several major cities, Beverly Lorig and the staff in the
Career Development and Placement Office have been busy strengthening the stu-
dent summer internship program. The objective here is to tap into Washington and
Lee’s extensive alumni network to help identify companies and organizations who
may have openings for summer interns. These internships are then promoted among
the student body. This is a wonderful program that benefits not only the students
and the sponsoring organizations, but also benefits Washington and Lee via an even
stronger student placement record.

Thanks also to the class agents and other Annual Fund volunteers who continue
their work toward this year’s record $2.7 million goal (see page 3). These funds, as
chairman Alan Tomlin °69 would be the first to tell you, are vital for Washington and
Lee to maintain its outstanding reputation among undergraduate and law schools.

Last, but by no means least, the men and women who make up the University’s
Board of Trustees deserve our sincere thanks. This very talented, interested, and
committed group of individuals contribute to the success of Washington and Lee in
countless ways. We are grateful for their efforts on behalf of Washington and Lee and
for their support of the Alumni Association.

The Alumni Board of Directors and the Law Council join me in inviting all alumni
who have class reunions to join us for what is always the highlight of out
annual calendar—Reunion Weekend festivities on campus in May. There will always
be changes at Washington and Lee, but the Colonnade and all it represents—tradI-
tion, honor, and excellence—looks better than ever.

Regarding Wilson

Robert Mottley’s feature on John
Wilson (“Without Fear or Favor,” Fall
1994) qualifies as required reading for
leaders at every quality liberal arts col-
lege facing current or future challenges.
Here’s why, I believe: Through some
autobiography and in his own ruminat-
ing, our departing president tidily places
change within the longer arc of values
inborn at Washington and Lee.
Moreover, his opening remark, “A uni-
versity education is a conversation,” has
all sorts of implications; to my way of
thinking, positive ones about the truly
“neutral” but well-fertilized common
ground any outstanding liberal arts col-
lege must offer any educated adult, of
any stripe, for the millennium. You have
to be a complex progressivist-conserva-
tive to have been the W&L steward
President Wilson seems to have been.

Jim Applebaum °62
Silver Spring, Md.

I would like to publicly thank John
Wilson for bringing joy to my years at
Washington and Lee and for remaining
a dear friend to me since. President
Wilson gave me a sense of belonging
during my days at W&L—a sense that
not only was my presence on campus
wanted but that it mattered. As an
African American woman clearly in the
minority at an institution steeped in
Southern tradition, his reassurances
were welcomed and appreciated.

I was disappointed in Cameron
Humphries’ rather snide response
(Letters, Winter) to Robert Mottley’s
profile of President Wilson in the
Alumni Magazine (“Without Fear or
Favor,” Fall 1994). Humphries insists
that Wilson has a “proverbial other side”
and questions his judgment as an
administrator, claiming his tactics have
not only “overwhelmed faculty depart-
ment heads” but have also “diminished
a once-pervasive trust and camaraderie

among professors.” While I am curious
to see Humphries’ list of those who have
allegedly bellowed these pleas for deliv-
erance, I will have to be content with
my list which includes the names of
department heads, faculty, and staff who
have said how sorry they are to see our
president go. One department head
went so far as to say he did not feel that
Wilson’s work has been fully appreciat-
ed during his years at the University.

I was also confused by Humphries’
description of the president as an “aloof
academic whose eccentricities of dress
and habit possess an endearing quality.”
When I think of President Wilson, the
image which comes to mind is of that
wide grin of his and the rippling laugh
which generally accompanies it. As for
“eccentricities of dress,” I never saw
President Wilson wear anything particu-
larly weird—not that clothes have a
thing in the world to do with one’s
effectiveness as an administrator.

Besides, what’s wrong with a little
eccentricity of dress? Just ask Tom
Wolfe °51. Weird can be good.

Mussolini and Lee?

“McDowell on Powell” (Fall 1994)
was a typically enjoyable Charles
McDowell piece, and it also brought
back for me some vivid memories of the
past. I, too, lived at Annie Jo White’s
home down in “The Hollow” in 1934-
35, with now-retired Major Gen. Arch
Sproul ’37 as my roommate. I recall
Annie Jo’s frequent laudatory references
to Lewis Powell, who was obviously one
of her all-time favorite students. I
remember, too, the photographs in her
living room—not only of Lee but also
one that troubled me considerably: an
autographed photo of Mussolini, whom
she admired for having cleaned up Italy
and made the trains run on time!

My fascination with the Lexington
past also reaches back to Robert E. Lee
through my paternal grandmother, nee
Mary Ella Sumner, of Louisa Court-
house, Va. She loved to tell me how she

had rolled Mrs. Lee in her wheelchaip
around the porch of the president’s
home during her visits to Lexington re}.
atives. Her reminiscences of the Rey,
Dr. John William Jones, Baptist minis-
ter, a college chaplain and biographer of
Lee, and Capt. Walter Bowie, proctor
and later treasurer of the college, who
also managed the Old Blue Inn (stil]
standing in 1933), fascinated me. I am
sure that her memories played a signifi- —
cant part in my decision to enter
Washington and Lee. In my freshman
year my parents drove my grandmother
to Lexington and she delighted in
pointing out the porch of the president’s
home as they drove up the Washington
Street hill!

These memories substantiate for me
Faulkner’s observation that “the past is
never dead. It’s not even past.”

Life and Taxes

Although I was well aware of Profes-
sor Tim Philipps’ most serious illness, it
did not lessen my sadness in learning of
his passing from the A/umni Magazine (In
Memoriam, Winter).

As a member of the law class of 1981,
I had the pleasure of being introduced
to and studying tax under Professor
Philipps during my final year of law
school, which was Professor Philipps’
very first academic year at Washington
and Lee. While few who would charac-
terize the study of tax law as a pleasure,
Professor Philipps succeeded in captuf-
ing my attention and sparking my intef-
est. This was no small task, but “Timmy
Tax” was so positive and so animated
about tax law that he literally breathed
life into the pages of the Internal
Revenue Code, transforming what hae
been a dreaded course into an enjoyable
experience. In speaking with Professof
Philipps at our five- and 10-year clas
reunions, it was clear that he had los

  
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  

none of his enthusiasm for tax law.

Professor Philipps was so effective
that, although his courses in Federa
Income Taxation I and II are the only

_

formal tax courses I have ever taken, I
landed my first job and subsequently

built an entire tax practice on the foun-

dation that he provided.

All of us no doubt realize far better
now than when we were students the
ubiquitous impact of taxes on our lives
as well as the importance that even a
basic knowledge of taxation has to so
many areas in the practice of law. Part of
Professor Philipps’ enduring legacy to
Washington and Lee is that his contri-
butions as a member of the W&L facul-
rv not only strengthened his students as
future lawyers but also strengthened the
School of Law as an institution.

Mere Words

I suppose that there has never been a
written obituary that adequately ex-
pressed the true worth of the individual
described. The “In Memoriam” section
of the A/umni Magazine (Winter) devoted
a paragraph to Dr. John H. Margolis *73.
Although the blurb was technically
accurate, it failed in its attempt to de-
scribe John Margolis, the human being.

‘Those of us who knew John during
his days at W&L would remember him
as being kind-hearted, energetic, and
loyal. He warmly greeted everyone he
met with a firm handshake and a sincere
smile. When he spoke to you, he always
made you feel as if you were especially
important. He approached every task
with determination and enthusiasm.
Whether the job was as menial as orga-
nizing the practice jerseys because he
Was the manager of the 1969-70 fresh-
man basketball team or leading his ZBT
fraternity through a financial crisis as its
President in 1972, John was someone
you could simply count on.

In his home in Dayton, Ohio, John
had an entire room devoted solely to
W&L memorabilia. The room looked
like W&L’s midwest outlet store filled
With chairs, glasses, hats, pennants, pic-
tures, lamps, clocks, and plates. When-
€ver I visited him, John would drag me

in a 6 a
to his “Generals” room where he

would play a tape of the W&L fight
song, make me a glass of grain punch,
and attempt to order a pizza from the
College Inn.

As I grow older, I have tried to accept
the inevitability of death. It has never
been easy. In the case of Dr. John H.
Margolis *73, the world has lost a kind
soul; a caring father and husband; and a
dedicated healer. I have lost someone
that had literally been my friend for my
entire life. We aren’t given very many of
those. Wherever you are, John, they
can’t take away your memory; you will
always be a part of me.

Dick Anderson wrote what some
readers might think to be an excellent
piece about Gerry Lenfest (“Gerry

who know that Gerry was and is a Sigma

Nu. For what it’s worth, I do not believe
Gerry would even associate with Sig

Th | Habitat for Humanity’s ‘Feel-Good’ Leader
C () ONNd C Francie Cohen ‘95 Builds on a Promise to Make a Difference
By her own admission, senior Francie
Cohen is a “reformed procrastinator” —
but when did she ever find the time to
procrastinate? During her first two years
at W&L, she was active in the Big Sisters
program, and when she witnessed home-
lessness firsthand—families living on
dirt floors in Lexington—“it really hit
me in the gut.” Then she remembered
hearing former President Jimmy Carter,
Habitat for Humanity’s most famous vol-
unteer, speak on campus as a freshman.
Cohen knew what she had to do next.
“There’s something about Habitat for
Humanity,” she explains. “It’s not a gov-
ernment handout. It’s not what people
consider charity. Something about it
really motivated me—the idea that one
person really can make a difference.”

So Cohen contacted
Habitat’s national head-
quarters in Americus, Ga., assembled some students on campus, and
began working toward a $10,000 challenge grant to W&L with a dollar-
for-dollar deadline of Dec. 16, 1994. She organized various fundraisers
on campus, one or two of which flopped (“The triathlon here did not
work out at all,” she says laughingly). “Three weeks before the dead-
line, “we were still about $1,600 short,” she recalls. Then she wrote a
letter that went to every member of Washington and Lee’s faculty,
staff, and administration. In her plea for help, Cohen quoted a 1979
text by James Graham Leyburn, and with a final boost from an anony-
mous donor, Habitat raised $11,500 on top of the challenge grant. “We
embodied the spirit of his quote,” she smiles. “Dr. Leyburn felt stu-
dents shouldn’t turn a blind eye to poverty, Now we have a viable way.”

Habitat is busy building a three-bedroom house on a vacant lot

 

 

 

 

 

Thanks to the efforts of senior Francie Cohen (opposite), donated by Threshold, Lexington’s rehabilitation committee. In addi-
Habitat for Humanity broke ground on tts first Lexington tion to the requisite 500 “sweat-equity” hours a family spends helping

home Jan. 19. Shoveling the ceremonial first dirt are (from with construction, the owners are required to pay Habitat back the
left) former Gov. Linwood Holton °44, trustee Virginia $20,000 cost in an interest-free mortgage over 10 to 20 years. Despite
“Jinks” Holton, Lexington mayor H.E. “Buddy” Derrick, warnings about the neighborhood, Cohen says, the community 1S
responding to Habitat’s presence. “A certified electrician offered help,”
she says. “Children from the neighborhood say, when can we help.”

In addition to student groups such as the Executive Committee and Kathekon,
others pitching in have included VMI cadets, local youth groups, even students from
neighboring universities coming for so-called “building blitzes” on their spring
breaks. “[Professor of journalism] Brian Richardson has been out there every Saturday
helping us,” Cohen says. “It’s really just a feel-good project.” Fundraising is already
underway for a second house—Habitat is raffling a week at Alumni College during
reunion weekend in May—and Cohen’s goal is to build one house a year.

Her immediate building challenge is to construct and train a committee for next |
year, but the real task, she explains, “is always finding that next piece of property.
That inspiration could come from anywhere: “People have really got to be careful
what they say around me,” she smiles, “because I don’t forget anything.”

‘Passover Portfolio’ to
Hang in Leyburn Library

A series of 10 graphics titled the
“Passover Portfolio” will soon be hang-
ing in the Leyburn Library thanks to a

gift by Alan Corwin ’62 and the generos-
ity of more than a dozen Jewish alumni
of Washington and Lee.

Corwin, who ts vice president of
investments at Dean Witter Reynolds in
Olympia, Wash., gave the signed-and-
numbered prints to the University in
memory of his daughter, Lisa Anne,
who died from injuries suffered during a
fall as a W&L freshman in May 1992.
The 21-by-16-inch serigraphs, by the
late Israeli artist Sholomo Katz, depict
the festival of the Passover—its customs
and the stories connected with it—using
a minimum of 20 screened colors against
a metallic gold background. ‘The series
has been included in the collections of
numerous churches and synagogues
throughout the country.

The prints were framed with the con-
tributions of alumni in honor of Lisa
Corwin. The display will be on perma-
nent exhibit in the Leyburn Library as a
means of celebrating the Jewish tradi-
tion at Washington and Lee.

Explain That to Helen

“No president has ever liked the
press, dating back to George Washing-
ton,” according to UPI reporter Helen

‘Thomas. And while

 

the dean of White
House correspon-
dents doesn’t go
quite that far back,
she has reported on

 

 

eight presidents,
from Kennedy to
Clinton, over the last
35 years with a “ring-
side seat to instant history.”

“Presidents should know, as reporters
always do, that you are only as good as
your last story,” ‘Thomas told an audi-
ence in Lee Chapel Jan. 31. The presi-
dential news conference, is “indispens-
able,” she adds, “because, believe it or
not, it’s the only institution in our soci-
ety where a president can be questioned
and held accountable on a regular
basis.” Or as President Gerald Ford
once said: “If God created the world in
six days, He could not have rested on
the seventh. He would have had to
explain it to Helen Thomas.”

Outstanding Faculty Award by the
Virginia Council of Higher Education.
Simpson was among 11 faculty members
statewide honored at a ceremony held in

Sophomore Housing
Coming to Campus

The Board of ‘Trustees in February
passed a new policy requiring all sopho-
mores to live in University housing
beginning with the Class of 1999. Under
this policy, seniors and juniors would
choose their own housing options and
would be given priority in requests for
University housing. Freshmen would
live in the freshman dormitories and
sophomores would live in University
housing including Gaines Hall, Woods
Creek Apartments, fraternity houses,
the International House, Chavis House,
and the Outing Club House.

The new plan takes into account
both residential and financial considera-
tions. According to a memorandum from
dean of students David L. Howison, the
administration felt that having more
students living in University housing
could improve their educational and
social interaction and provide a more
energetic and positive residential com-
munity on campus. W&L loses between
$1,800 and $2,500 for every vacant space
in University housing (except for frater-
nities, which must pay for all spaces
whether they are occupied or not).

Liberty Hall Archaeology
Subject of Recent Book

An Archaeological and Historical Assess-
ment of the Liberty Hall Academy Complex
1782-1803, by John McDaniel *64, Kurt
Russ ’78, and Parker Potter °79, has
been published as the second volume in
Washington and Lee’s James G. Ley-
burn Papers in Anthropology series. The
book summarizes the archaeological
fieldwork and artifact analysis undertak-
en from 1973 to 1991 and addresses the
Scotch-Irish settlement of the area, new
findings about the evolution of the acad-
emic campus at Liberty Hall, and the
nature of 18th-century student life.

Professor of anthropology McDaniel
co-wrote the work with former students
Russ, a research archaeologist at W&L,
and Potter, historical archaeologist with
the Division of Historical Resources in
New Hampshire. The $20 book is avail-
able through the University Bookstore.

Familiar Quotations
From a Reluctant Pundit

Does associate professor of politics
William F. Connelly Jr. (shown above
with Indiana Sen. and Republican presi-
dential wannabe Richard Lugar) know
something we don’t? Last May, he coau-
thored a book titled Congress’ Permanent
Minority? Republicans in the U.S. House.
Six months later, the minority became
the majority—and faster than you can
say “Newt Gingrich,” Connelly’s name
turned up on every reporter’s Rolodex
who had a question about the new
power brokers in Washington.

“The title was not meant to be a pre-
diction,” he insists. “It simply refers to
the Republicans’ seemingly permanent
majority status that had become a defin-
ing characteristic of the House. There
had been no serious books on this body
tor 25 years. The timing was fortunate.”

Connelly was quoted everywhere
trom USA Today and The Washington Post
to the /nternational Herald Tribune. But
the life of a pundit is not an easy one,
and Connelly is glad that his 15 minutes

+s

( Ps ,¢ ’
f sound bites are over. “I’d rather

teach, try to install a love of politics in
rn _— 7 $9 “ /

Y students.” But he adds, “I did get a
Call] trom George Will once...” And a

Smile cnre ’  f.
ule Spreads across Connelly Ss face.

 

 

 

 

Resume Padding? It’s
All in the Pudding

things you did in college? Well, we
won't get into them here, but odds
are that pudding wrestling wasn’t
among them. Times have changed,
folks. The vaunted Jello-like sport

The Other John Elrods

Funny things, these electronic
database searches. En route to look-
ing up news of our newly minted
president, we found a story about a
baggage handler loading luggage
onto carts at the new Denver Inter-
national Airport. You can guess his
name. Then there’s the man who,
as a cellmate of Lee Harvey Oswald
on Nov. 22, 1963, made headlines
again in Dallas last summer as one
more footnote to the Kennedy con-
spiracy theory textbook. Our John
Elrod has an alibi, we are told.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fancy Dress, Strom!

For his white-tie debut in the
nation’s capital in December, con-
gressional aide Richard Perry °91 of
Aiken, S.C., borrowed his ensemble
from a friend in high places—U.S.
Sen. Strom Thurmond. The 40-
year-old tux and tails required some
alterations—Perry’s 6'3", Strom is
5'10"—but hey, the Republicans
promised us change in Washington.

A nationwide search for Washington and Lee’s next president
came home with the unanimous selection of our own John Elrod

The moments leading up to the
announcement of the 22nd president of
Washington and Lee were filled with
excitement, curiosity, and not the least
bit of uncertainty. Though the buzz on
the street pointed toward John W.
Elrod, vice president for academic
affairs and dean of the college, few peo-
ple knew this fact for certain, and Lee
Chapel was packed to the rafters with
anticipation, exhilaration, and close to
600 friends and well-wishers.

In such a highly charged environ-
ment, it’s understandable how even
Elrod could forget himself, however
briefly. As he and his wife, Mimi, were
escorted ahead of President John
Wilson and his wife, Anne, to General
Lee’s pew in Lee Chapel to await the 2
p.m. announcement, they were stopped
in their tracks by a student marshal.

“This space is reserved for the new
president,” she told them politely, but
firmly nonetheless.

“This zs the new president,” she was
told, politely but firmly nonetheless.

The Elrods were promptly seated.

The announcement minutes later by
A. Stevens Miles Jr. °51, rector of the
Board of Trustees, was the culmination
of a highly confidential search that took
almost a year to complete and entailed
137 candidates, 11 semi-finalists, four
finalists, and the work of two commit-
tees: the presidential search committee,
chaired by professor William J. Watt,
former dean of the college; and the
Board of Trustees selection committee,
chaired by Miles. Following a final
round of interviews in Charlotte, N.C.,
in January, Elrod emerged as the unani-
mous recommendation of the commit-
tee and, subsequently, the full board.

“Elrod was conceded only a place
among the finalists in the selection
process,” Miles says. “Each finalist was
measured against the qualifications we
sought in the next president of our
University. To have survived a highly
competitive final round of interviews is
indeed a tribute to John Elrod.”

The announcement was met with an

BY BRIAN SHAW

eruption of applause—long, sustained
applause—from the gathering of
trustees, faculty, students, alumni, and
friends, and Elrod was visibly moved as
he stepped to the podium. “The
response shows that he has the com-
plete support of the faculty, students,
and trustees,” professor of politics and
former dean of students Lewis John °58
told the Roanoke Times © World-News.
The wait, at last, was over. And the
choice, in the minds of those assem-
bled, was one worthy of Robert E. Lee.

John Elrod knew something about
Washington and Lee growing up in
Griffin, Ga., a town of 20,000 located 40
miles south of Atlanta and some 500
miles from Lexington. He earned a B.A.
in English from Presbyterian College in
Clinton, S.C., and later his master’s and
doctorate in the philosophy of religion
from Columbia University. It wasn’t
until 1983, when he visited Washington
and Lee from Iowa State University t0
deliver a series of lectures—titled

“Einstein and God”—that he became
familiar with the campus.

Some two months following Elrod’s
visit, Bill Watt, dean of the college since
1971, announced his intention to step
down and return to teaching, and
search was subsequently underway.
Someone suggested that the philoso-
pher from Iowa State might make a
good candidate for dean, and Elrod’s
name was added to the search.

“When we moved to lowa State in
1971,

years,” says Elrod, who rose from assis-

we thought we would stay a few

tant professor of philosophy to depart-
ment chair during his time at lowa State
(where he chaired the religious studies
program as well). “But those few years
turned into 13 and we thought maybe
ve’d stay on the plains. Then I became
a candidate for the dean’s job and gladly
accepted it when offered.”

In returning to their native South, the
Elrods found an institution in the throes
of change. “We came to Washington and
Lee not knowing if we would be part of
a single sex or coeducational institu-

+s

tion,” Elrod recalls. “Either way, it
didn’t matter—there was already a solid
curriculum and a good core of courses.
The University was committed to hiring
outstanding faculty.” He and Mimi
moved into their house on White Street
in Lexington on July 14, 1984. That
same day, the Board of ‘Trustees voted
in favor of coeducation.

In the years since that historic deci-
sion, Elrod has worked as dean and vice
president for academic affairs toward
strengthening the faculty and develop-
ing the academic programs that are the
lifeblood of Washington and Lee. “The
thing that I am most pleased about is
deepening and strengthening the facul-
y,” he says of his record as the Univer-
sity’s principal academic officer. “To my
mind, the key to successfully delivering
a quality education to young people is
finding the brightest and most able
teacher/scholars available. We are suc-
ceeding in doing that.”

Another area in which Elrod takes
pride is the growing interdisciplinary
relationships between departments.
Over the past decade, Elrod has over-

seen the expansion of the curriculum to

12

 

As PU niversity’s ninth suc

embrace new programs including cogni-

tive science. neuroscience, Russian
studies. and Medieval and Renaissance
Studies, and the disciplinary boundaries,

he says, are growing fuzzier every day.

“The sciences, for example, are being

drawn closer together, and there are
some interesting developments in the
humanities as well,” he says. “We are
seeing these kinds of changes through-
out the curriculum. We must continue
to take advantage of these opportunities
when the interests of the faculty make

them possible.”

Elrod also points to the strengthening

of the sciences at Washington and Lee

over the last 10 years. The $21 million

science center currently under construc-
tion is the embodiment of that growth,
he says, but Elrod also sees the addi-
tional faculty and the commitment to
teaching through research with students
as another example of how the sciences
have grown and developed at the

University.

John and Mimi Elrod are both quick
to say they want their lifestyle to contin-
ue much as it has since they came
Lexington. Yet, given the trappings of
the presidency, they realize that might
not be easy.

While they will keep their house 0?
White Street, the Elrods are eager ©

make Lee House their home and will

move in over the summer. The Elrods
clearly believe that General Lee’s house
belongs to the Washington and Lee
family: “Lee House has always been a
special place for alumni, students, and
Parents,” says Mimi. “We want to de-
vote a lot of time to having guests in and
to making people feel welcome there.”
Phat includes continuing their long
running tradition of frequent informal
dinners with students. The guest lists
for those dinners are assembled by

\ . . »
limi from students she has come to

k sa
a through auditing classes and
tnre a e : ,

ugh her work as associate director of

Ss e 1h . rT
Pecial programs. “The students help

 

with everything from setting the table to
washing the dishes,” John explains. “It’s
a wonderful opportunity to find out
what’s on the students’ minds.”

John Elrod will still be among the
first to arrive at work at Washington and
Lee, settling in often before most mem-
bers of the buildings and grounds
department and sending E-mail mes-
sages to colleagues around 5:30 a.m. He
is considering moving the traditional
Monday lunch meeting of the presi-
dent’s senior staff to a breakfast meeting
to accommodate lunchtime exercise.
Mimi, meanwhile, plans to continue her
work in the Office of Special Programs,
although after this summer she will con-

centrate exclusively on the Summer
Scholars program (see page 39). She will
also continue with her volunteer activi-
ties in the community. Both avid tennis
players, John and Mimi plan to contin-
ue playing as much tennis as their
schedules will allow. Grown sons Adam
and Joshua will visit when they can.

Then there is the travel. Although
both John and Mimi are well known to
alumni across the country, they plan to
visit as many alumni chapters and indi-
vidual alumni as they can. Travel will
begin in earnest this fall.

“We have had a marvelous outpour-
ing of alumni support in the capital
campaign,” Elrod says. “One of the
great strengths of Washington and Lee
is that it is a family. If there is one thing
that sews the alumni together in a
seamless way it is the commitment to
the Honor System and to the traditions
of the University. It is extremely impor-
tant that the president make the alumni
continue to feel they are an important
part of the family.”

There’s a point in the campaign
video On the Shoulders of Giants where
the narrator asks rhetorically, “Where is
Washington and Lee going?” The
response, spoken in a soothing, reassur-
ing tone tipped with Southern inflec-
tion, says: “You may not be satisfied
with this answer, but I’m going to say
we're not going anywhere. By that I
mean, there are going to be... . changes
in the curriculum, but we’re going to
continue to be a college which values
very highly the development of the
whole person.”

That voice, spoken from the heart in
an interview and not from a script,
belongs to John Elrod. As Elrod stands
ready to assume the presidency of
Washington and Lee, he sees his princi-
pal role as continuing the traditions of
high standards and excellence created
by John Wilson, Robert E.R. Huntley
50, °57L, and their predecessors. (Elrod
is only the second president this centu-
ry to come from within the administra-
tion; the first was Huntley, in 1968.)

Of the tasks facing Elrod immediate-
ly, the first is to find his successor as
vice president for academic affairs and

13

 

dean of the college (associate dean of
the college Lad Sessions will serve as
acting dean for the coming academic
year). With a faculty search committee
already in place, he hopes to have the
new dean in position by next summer.
The second task is to develop a five-
year plan that examines every aspect of
University life from academic programs,
athletics, and student life to bricks and
mortar. “We all have to work on forward
progress,” Elrod says. “We must contin-
ue to operate the University as efficient-
ly as we can. Higher education is a
labor-intensive, expensive enterprise.
We need to continue what we’re doing
and improve upon it. We must develop

14

more efficient and effective ways to

spend our dollars.”

Elrod feels Washington and Lee
must continue to bring more interna-
tional focus to the academic program in
the largest sense. “Our students are
graduating into a world growing smaller
by the day, and we must prepare them
for that,” he says. “I will ask the faculty
to think about ways in which an
enriched international focus can be
brought to the curriculum, to student
and faculty profiles, and to student life
as well.”

Although the new science center
remains the University’s number one
construction priority, there are other

As dean of the college, Elrod has overseen
the expansion of the curriculum to embrace

interdisciplinary programs at W&L.,

areas that need immediate attention—
such as the new student center which
was tabled midway through the cam-
paign out of deference to the construc.
tion of the science center. “I supported
that decision when it was made and stij}
do,” Elrod says, “yet we must return to
that decision now and see if a new sty-
dent center is in our future.”

Other projects to be considered
include accommodations for W&L’s
four sororities, renovation of Reid Hall,
new space for art or music, a thorough
examination of all athletic facilities, and
a review of the University’s master plan,
“Obviously we can’t do all that in five
years,” Elrod admits. “Now we must
determine our priorities.”

Admissions also remains a priority of
the highest order for Elrod. “We have
enjoyed a wonderful time in recent
years in attracting students of the high-
est quality, both in academic credentials
and in their capacity to contribute out-
side the classroom,” he says. “We must
continue to pay attention to the children
of alumni and to attracting multi-talent-
ed classes each year. There is a symbiot-
ic relationship between attracting good
students and good faculty. We must do
all we can to maintain that relationship.”

On the morning Elrod was formally
chosen to be the next president of
Washington and Lee, the Board of
Trustees gathered for its regular morn-
ing meeting before adjourning to execu-
tive session to elect the new president.

Following what was probably the
shortest executive session in W&L
history, board members wanted Elrod to
return to the meeting to offer congratu-
lations, but he was nowhere to be found.
Soon enough, it was discovered that
Elrod had taken advantage of the break
in the meeting to get in a few laps
around the Wilson Field track. The new
president’s activities prompted one
trustee to quip, “I guess the Elrod
administration is off to a running start.”

Yes, and there’s no slowing dowm
from here. ®

Mike Marshall ’86 and his family’s management company
are making plans to restore the wonder to Natural Bridge

15

“Tt is impossible for the emotions
arising from the sublime to be felt beyond
what they are here; so beautiful an arch,
so elevated, so light, springing as it were
up to heaven. The rapture of the specta-
tor is really indescribable.”

—Thomas Jefferson,
future president of the United States,

describing Natural Bridge, circa 1782

“Tl bet this is the biggest collection of
Junk anywhere in the world.”

—Edward Atwood,

then dean of students, describing the

Natural Bridge gift shop, circa 1962

or more than four decades of

Washington and Lee men, the

image of Natural Bridge conjures

up distant memories of three days
of freshman camp: of lengthy sessions
under a tent listening to the exhorta-
tions of Dean Gilliam or Dean Atwood;
of coach Norm Lord’s motivational
speeches; of being indoctrinated into
the Honor System by those compara-
tively worldly upperclassmen; of win-
ning the name contest (first prize: a
W&L blanket), or the talent contest
(first prize: a W&L chair); or, perhaps,
least memorably, of sleeping four to a
room—there were only two beds—with
a large and equally uncomfortable
stranger for a bedmate.

From 1932 until as late as 1979, fresh-
men were sequestered far from the dis-
tractions of Lexington and the tempta-
tions of fraternities—they were captive,
really—to be introduced “to the work,
recreation, friendships, traditions, and
ideals of Washington and Lee in an
informal, relaxed atmosphere,” as the
University catalog once put It.

Mike Marshall °86 was born too late
to experience the comforts of freshman
camp at Natural Bridge (although his
parents stayed at the Natural Bridge
Hotel during Parents’ Weekends at
W&L). But the wonders of Natural
Bridge have found their way into his
business life as vice president of opera-
tions for Marshall Management Inc. of

16

Salisbury, Md., which in January as-
sumed the duties as managing agent of
all 1,600 acres of the Natural Bridge of
Virginia—from the hotel to the wax
museum and everything else in between.

Marshall Management operates
hotels and other properties in eight
states, from a 406-room Quality Inn in
Chicago to a 96-room Comfort Inn in
Salisbury, as well as airport and resort
properties. Natural Bridge’s principal
owner is Angelo Puglisi, a Washington
(D.C.) investor who with his associates
purchased the landmark in April 1988
for $6.5 million. Marshall Management's
success in handling other properties for
Puglisi landed them the Natural Bridge
assignment.

“Our main job is taking over bank-
rupt or distressed properties and making
them profitable again,” says Marshall,
who has been with the family business
(founded in 1980 by his father, company
president Charles L. Marshall) for seven
years now. “We've made other hotels
profitable and we worked hard trying to
get management of Natural Bridge.”

 

On his first visit to Rockbridge
County’s biggest attraction, Marshall
wasn’t all that impressed with the hotel
itself, which was finished in 1964 at a
cost of $1 million (fire destroyed the
original hotel in 1963). “But I was
impressed with the facility,” he says.
“And the bridge itself is magnificent.”

egend has it that Natural Bridge

was discovered by the ancient

Monacan Indian tribe when they

crossed the bridge to safety while
being pursued by the warring
Powhatans. (The Monacans called it the
“Bridge of God” and worshipped it; in
April, descendants of the Monacan tribe
gathered at Natural Bridge for an hon-
est-to-goodness powwow featuring
Indian crafts and the like.) The first
written account of the Bridge dates back
to 1742, in the journal of John Petet
Sallings, the first white settler in the
Valley of Virginia. Some seven or eight
years later, an 18-year-old assistant
working for Col. Peter Jefferson named
George Washington surveyed the origi-

 

 

Everything has its price: Among the items not shown here awaiting the unsuspecting tourist in
the Natural B

nal 157 acres surrounding the bridge,
climbed the south wall, and chiselled his
initials into the rock.

Peter Jefferson’s son, ‘Thomas, pur-
chased the property in a land grant from
King George III of England in 1774, and
built some cabins on the site, none of
which have survived. Natural Bridge
remained in the Jefferson family until
his grandson, Thomas J. Randolph, sold
the Bridge to Joel Lockland in 1835 for
$1,500, and the property passed through
many hands over the next 100 years.
There are extensive archives at Natural
Bridge which document its rich her-
itage, and Marshall is anxious to play up
the historical aspects in his marketing
Plan. “You could say Natural Bridge was
the first presidential retreat,” he says.

He admits he may be stretching
things a bir.

riving along Interstate 81, travelers
can’t miss at least a few of the 31
billboards that advertise Natural
Bridge as far north as this side of
Woodstock. Va., and as far south as

<i

idee gift shop are rattlesnake eggs, everything Elvis, and all manner of découpage.

below Roanoke. It attracts some 250,000
visitors each year—and the bridge itself,
one of the “seven natural wonders of
the world,” isn’t all there is to see.
‘There are caverns, hiking trails, canoe
rentals, a gift shop, and the infamously
campy wax museum with its 125 waxen
denizens, from Elvis to Jesus and the 12
apostles (as depicted by Michaelangelo
in the Last Supper room).

You might have missed the bill-
board—yes, one billboard—that men-
tions the hotel itself. “As a result,
tourists stop to visit the attractions,
spend about three hours, then get in
their cars, and continue down the inter-
state,” Marshall says. “It is now just a
stopping place. We want to make it
more of a destination.”

Marshall Management is embarking
on a major marketing plan to, as Mike
puts it, “get that place rockin’ and
rollin’ again.” He points to the Home-
stead and Greenbrier, less than 100
miles away, as role models. “You pay
top dollar at those places,” he says.
“You can have a similar experience at

Natural Bridge for a lot less money.”

Well... maybe someday. The com-
pany hopes to buy back the land that
was sold to developers who began con-
structing a golf course, a venture that
failed. A golf course would bring
Natural Bridge a little closer to becom-
ing more of a resort property.

Marshall says they also want to go
after the corporate market. Natural
Bridge has wonderful facilities already
—180 guest rooms, meeting rooms, ball-
rooms, and an elegant Southern-style
dining room. It would be a comfortable
place for corporate meetings, training
sessions, and retreats. “You can’t get
into too much trouble at night at
Natural Bridge,” he notes, assuring cor-
porate clients that their employees will
have no trouble making it to their early
morning meetings.

Renovations have already begun at
the hotel. A third of the rooms have
been remodeled with new furniture,
carpet, drapes, and bedspreads and work
will begin soon on some bare-bones
refurbishing. Plans call for a major
upgrade in landscaping, including
dredging the pond down by the bridge
to bring back the swans. Stocking the
pond with trout is another possibility.

ven if freshman camp is only a

three-day blur now, Natural

Bridge continues to link W&L

alumni Over a certain age with
their first brush with the University and
its traditions. Alumni returning for their
25th reunion in May will celebrate the
occasion with a dinner banquet at the
Bridge. They'll remember the games,
the tent, the beds. A few of them may
even leave with souvenirs.

And as for that remark about the gift
shop being “the biggest collection of
junk anywhere in the world,” it seems
that former Natural Bridge general man-
ager James N. “Piggy” Hunter had the
last word on Dean Atwood, as Frank
Parsons °54 recalls the story.

“At the Grand Canyon,” Piggy
cracked, “they have a couple of thou-
sand square feet more.” @

THE ORIGINS OF LEADERSHIP

Honorary ODK initiate Bill Smith ’63 relates

the ‘epiphany’ that led him to education reform

In 1968, Bill Smith °63 and his wife,
Becky, were packing to leave Birming-
ham for their new home in Minneapolis.
Smith had finished his MBA and taken
a job with General Mills, and the newly-
weds were excited about beginning life
together. Then he got a call from Lew
Adams, dean of the school of commerce
and administration at Washington and
Lee. Adams asked Smith to consider
changing his career and come to Lexing-
ton as an instructor. “Forever since,”
Smith says, “I have had this poignant
longing for what the road less traveled
might have been like.”

Smith has since enjoyed a distin-
guished career as chairman of Royal
Cup Coffee, which rang up sales of $66
million in 1993, and has found a second
calling in education reform, as he details
in the following story, which ts adapted
from his talk at this year’s Omicron
Delta Kappa initiation ceremonies held

on Jan. 19 in Lee Chapel.

18

I matriculated, by accident or coinci-
dence, at Washington and Lee in the
fall of 1959. My father had gone to VMI
from Birmingham, and my first expo-
sure to W&L was looking up at the
Colonnade during a VMI reunion when
my dad and his two closest friends
walked with their three young teenage
sons up the street on the way to a
reunion party at VMI. Years later, those
other two first sons became brother rats;
knowing only that I absolutely could
not see myself at VMI, I accepted a
scholarship to Princeton—probably for
no better reason than that I was trying
so hard to impress all those people
around me.

But then, for me, an amazing thing
happened: For some reason, two people
here at W&L did not give up on me
that spring and summer of 1959. Dean
Frank Gilliam kept writing and calling
my mother, a Richmond native, about
the venerable Southern traditions here
on campus. And coach Bob McHenry
kept telling me there was no way |
could hope to make the basketball team
at Princeton. At some point, I changed
my decision, and I came to W&L.

It didn’t take me long, however, to

shatter Dean Gilliam’s expectations. Six
weeks or so into my freshman year, an
episode involving a barrage of firecrack-
ers and roman candles in the Freshman
Quad led a now altogether unfriendly
Dean Gilliam to place me on social pro-
bation and toss me out of the freshman
dormitory for three months. I was in a
quandary about where to live for those
months when I received a call from my
advisor, Dr. James Graham Leyburn,
who asked if I would be interested in a
small apartment upstairs in his home.
And in just that way, early on at
Washington and Lee, I came under the
substantial influence of one of the many
great liberal arts scholars and teachers
who have become legends in the history
of this University. There were many
others who followed Dr. Leyburn in
working to shape the thinking and val-
ues which have become guiding pafa-
meters for my life, but the influence
that resonates throughout my life comes
from Dr. Leyburn. I lived with him fot
two years; he stretched my mind fre-
quently with gentle insistence. And I
struggled to understand this manner of
man whose ascetic lifestyle and spartan
disciplines belied the richly varied cul

cure of his interests and knowledge. I
can still hear, in my mind’s ear, the
notes of Chopin or Debussy as they
came up from Dr. Leyburn’s piano in
the late hours of every afternoon.

Because | was young, and shallow,
what Dr. Leyburn—and Washington
and Lee, really—did for me was to lead
me to discover what was “right” and
what was “wrong”—what was “good”
and “bad” about the world around me.
This kind of ethical relativity ultimately
bred the development of a social con-
science, or social responsibility—the
notion that we, in our generation, were
only stewards of the world around us—
and finally led to the conviction that we
should leave our small parts of this
world better for those who come
behind.

So W&L was, for me, a sort of
“moveable feast” —academics, competi-
tive athletics, social binges to be sure,
but most of all a life-shaping interaction
with great men whose intellectual hon-
esty and curiosity have been a light-
house for the last 30 years.

So what does any of this have to do
with leadership, or the origins of leader-
ship? You students will shortly graduate
from W&L and will go on, no doubt, to
have very successful lives in your occu-
Pation or profession. Many of you will
have families, and you will accumulate
much in the way of material possessions
and experiences. But there will come a
day when you will have the opportunity
to Provide leadership to those around
you, In a way that will make their lives
richer or better—and you will have to
Choose if you are to be a leader.

You see, I come to Lee Chapel this
morning a vastly different individual
than the person who celebrated his 25th
reunion here on campus in 1988. Then I
was a Birmingham businessman, an
employer of some 500 men and women;
I had been involved in running six dif-
ferent corporations, four of them start-
ups, and served on the many, standard,
corporate and nonprofit boards; I was a
husband, with a wonderful wife, a father
of three sons; I coached a Little League
team and was an assistant Scoutmaster.
I thought of myself as reasonably happy
and fairly successful. Most of my wor-
ries were about such things as business
profits, or return on investment; about
our sons’ SAT scores and where they
might be accepted to college; what our
next “unforgettable” family vacation
might be. And I thought of myself as a
decent contributor to our society—
tithing, if you will, about 10 percent of
my time to a variety of community and
state causes—paying my Civic rent.

But all of that vaguely smug self-sat-
isfaction vanished when I helped found,
and then participated in, a statewide
program called Leadership Alabama,
spending five wonderful weekend
retreats over nine months with 50 other
so-called state leaders networking
among ourselves, and being sensitized
to the challenges and opportunities
which faced and would face our state
during the next decade. The moment of
epiphany for me came when we spent
three days examining our public educa-
tion systems in Alabama, more precise-
ly, our state’s K-12 schools. I learned
that, by most available yardsticks,

Alabama’s schools in 1980 had ranked
about in the middle of the southeastern
average—behind Virginia, North
Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, and
Georgia—but ahead of South Carolina,
Arkansas, West Virginia, Kentucky, and
of course, Mississippi.

But in 1990, all of those states that
had 10 years earlier trailed Alabama now
were ahead of our state on those same
yardsticks—except, of course, Missis-
sippi (and Mississippi has now pulled
ahead, too). I learned that our state was
dead last in the amount of local financial
support for our K-12 schools; that we
had more portable classrooms than pos-
sibly any other southeastern state; and
that we had only one computer for every
26 students in our classrooms.

I learned that some of our state’s
high schools do not offer a foreign lan-
guage of any kind in a world where bar-
riers between most nations no longer
exist. In Alabama, there are high schools
in which the most advanced math
course offered is something called
General Math, and schools where you
could not even consider applying to a
college like W&L, or even Alabama or
Auburn, because your high school did
not offer a single laboratory science
course such as biology, physics, or
chemistry.

And what was the payoff—the result
of this neglect? Roughly 80 percent of
our public school students score below
the national average on the Stanford
Achievement tests at fourth grade and
eighth grade levels—30 percent of our
public school students drop out before
they earn a high school diploma; one out

19

of eight of our state’s citizens, or half a
million people, are functionally illiter-
ate; and 90 percent of those in Ala-
bama’s prisons and two-thirds of those
receiving food stamps and Medicaid
payments were these self-same high
school dropouts.

In 1991, we asked our top elected
state officials and our top state educa-
tion leaders, how can this be fixed? To
our collective amazement, they ex-
plained to us that Alabama would never
join the rest of the South and the nation
in the reform of our schools—until the
people in Alabama rose up and demand-
ed that the reforms be made. That our
state was so riven with special interest
politics that the political process simply
would not respond to the public need—
no matter how compelling—until forced
to by a groundswell of angry voters.

Later that weekend, one woman
stood up and asked all of us, “If we are
supposed to be leaders in this state, we
have only two choices. We can continue
to complain and moan, and to criticize
those with the responsibility for public
education; or we can roll up our collec-
tive sleeves and work to offer solutions
to the crisis in our educational system!”

And in just that way, a grassroots
organization called A-Plus was born.
Hundreds of us initially, but with a cur-
rent membership today of more than
25,000, have spent more than three
years working to make Alabama’s
schools better. We criss-crossed the
country, finding the programs that were
working in public schools; we worked
with the finest education minds in the
country to build a reform plan that

20

“1 am certainly not the same person who
came to his 25th reunion in 1988. The
smug, self-satisfied, comfort level of my
life has disappeared, perhaps, for good.
| have become a missionary for public

schools... and it has become my strong

conviction that a rigorous liberal arts
education 1s a necessary bedrock of good

soctal leaders.”

would propel Alabama not just ahead of
Mississippi, or the rest of the south, but
to a place as good as any in the nation.
Both the Business Roundtable in Wash-
ington and the National Governors
Association recognized our reform
strategies as among the top five or six in
the nation. We were awarded grants
from the Annie Casey and BellSouth
foundations to continue this work; and
teams of educators from other states—
North Carolina, Michigan, and even
Virginia—met with us to see what we
were attempting.

But then we ran, naively, headlong
into the political season. We were
opposed by the Eagle Forum, by our
state’s Teacher Union, and by the
Christian Coalition, and we failed in two
special legislative sessions to pass some
of the essential reforms. But we have
elected five reformers to our eight-mem-
ber state school board, and the issue of
quality public schools has become an
imperative in every corner of our state.
We cannot agree, at this point, on the
nature of the specific reforms needed;
but, thank heavens, we all agree that our
schools must improve.

And today, I am changed in some
ways, I think, forever, because of this
effort. | am certainly not the same per-
son who came to his 25th reunion in
1988. The smug, self-satisfied, comfort
level of my life has disappeared, per-
haps, for good. I have become a mission-
ary for public schools.

It has only been in these last five or
six years that I have begun to under-
stand how significant a role my under-
graduate, liberal arts education has

 

played in coming to this set of responsj-
bilities. And it has become my strong
conviction that a rigorous liberal arts
education is a necessary bedrock of
good social leaders; that the great liberal _
arts institutions like Washington and —
Lee are—and should be—the source of
some of our nation’s finest leaders. a
It concerns me greatly that there is,
afoot in this land, a meanspiritedness
wherein we must personally attack the
holder of a different view or belief, with
mounting waves of anger and distrust,
and a rhetoric of indictment and nega-
tivism that has reached new pinnacles. —
And I worry that we have forgotten how
to be civil to each other. nj
The great liberal arts institutions —
engender a sense of “civility’—a toler-
ance of diversity, and a forbearance for
the disagreement among ideas and
opinions. A liberal arts education
becomes a state of mind, really—search- —
ing, open, curious, tolerant, and con- —
cerned—a conversation that begins here
on campus for four years, but goes on to”
last a lifetime. ts
‘Today in Lexington, this campus —
rests truly on the shoulders of giants—_
George Washington and Robert E. Lee,
most certainly, but also on men like-
Plato, Shakespeare, Aristotle, Adam
Smith, Socrates, and maybe even Dr.
Leyburn. We do not do our world any
favors if we do not know who they are—
or for what they stand.
You undergraduates will leave thi
institution with a marvelous foundati¢
for leadership. Years from now, whet
the time comes—when your opportu
ty comes—do not let it pass you by. #

 
  
  
 
 
 

  
    
    
 

 

 

The eyes of the advertising world are on Ben West ’73,

On March 9, whoops and
cheers went out in Tampa
Bay and St. Petersburg when,
after decades of frustration,
Florida’s largest metropolitan
area was awarded a major
league franchise, the Devil
Rays, to play baseball in 1998.

The following afternoon,
a quieter celebration took
place on the 35th floor of the
Landmark Centre in down-
town Tampa in the space-
age spaces of WestGroup:
Florida’s third-largest adver-
tising and marketing agency
had just won the account to
market Avanti. It’s not a car,
or a computer, but a revolu-
tionary condom. And West-
Group’s success in landing

 

the account—another “David
vs. Goliath” struggle, in the
words of company president
Ben West ’73—is one more
indication that his 10-year-
old ‘Tampa firm is closer than
ever to the major leagues.

In 1994, WestGroup post-
ed billings of $89.4 million,
up 14.2 percent over the pre-
vious year and good enough
for seventh place among the
largest southeast agencies
measured by Adweek. The
firm boasts a client list that
includes Publix Super
Markets, Outback Steak-
houses, Royal Caribbean

Cruise Lines, and divisions
of AT&T and Disney, to
name a few. That list is
always subject to change,
but it’s all part of the game.
“We're going to have to
work really hard to move
onto that national stage,”
says the red-haired and
bearded West (whose resem-
blance to red-haired and
bearded TV ad exec Elliot
Weston on “thirtysome-
thing” did not go unnoticed
during that show’s ’80s hey-
day). “I don’t know of a
more volatile business.”

A “classic liberal arts stu-
dent” at W&L, West consid-
ered a career in diplomatic
relations or law before find-
ing his true calling. His

father owned a small ad firm
in Jacksonville, and he spent
a couple of summers getting
exposed to the business and
“the collection of personali-
ties it seemed to attract.”
West eventually gravitat-
ed in the direction of overall
account management. “You
become somewhat of a gen-
eralist,” he explains, “like a
quarterback on the team.”
He spent nearly a decade in
New York working at some
of the world’s largest firms:
Young & Rubicam, Ogilvy &
Mather, and D’Arcy Mac-
Manus Masius WorldWide.
High-end, sophisticated,
anthropologically-based
research became his forte,
and as associate director of

multinational client services
at D’Arcy, West handled
worldwide account planning
for brands like M&M/Mars
and Anheuser-Busch while
working in the corporate
think-tank of a billion-dollar
firm. “I thought, God, this is
great. I’m young, and I’m
blessed,” he recalls.

Then he got a call from
his father, Cecil, an illustra-
tor-turned-agency man who
was preparing to retire from
the firm he started in 1968.
Would his son be interested
in returning to Jacksonville
and running the business?

Emboldened by the fact
that some of the industry's
best creative work was
emerging away from the ad
hubs of New York City and
Chicago, West took his dad
up on his offer and returned
to his native Florida in 1985.
He assumed the reins with
one client (Independent
Life), two people, and 4
trade association member
ship, and those first few
years were heavy with plan
ning and consulting work
and market research and the
occasional industry accolade
(West & Co. won the Inter
national Broadcasting Award
in 1987 for the “World’s Best
Television Commercial”

 

with a clever spot made for
Jacksonville's Independent
Insurance Group).

Then, at the end of 1988,
West landed its first big fish:
the $20 million Publix ac-
count. The feel-good adver-
tising, marrying the more
laid-back Florida lifestyle
with buoyant music such as
reggae, moV\ ed the grocer’s
image in a whole new direc-
tion, and West moved his
company from Jacksonville
to Tampa in 1989. Today,
WestGroup employs 90 peo-
ple in offices in Tampa,
Atlanta, and Miami, and
keeps a small administrative
office in Jacksonville (in the
Independent Life building).

While the agency per-
forms four central functions
—account management, cre-
ative, media, and research
and account planning—the
creative drives the rest of the
business, and under the guid-
ance of executive creative
director Martin Macdonald,
Who worked on the Saturn
#Ccount for Hal Riney, West
has a team that can play with
the big boys: “We have the
quality of clients and quality
of people to compete regu-
arly for national accounts.”

senior management. “One of
the benefits of doing your
own business is picking your
own people,” West says, and
in addition to Macdonald,
who hails from Scotland by
way of Manchester, West-
Group’s chief operating offi-
cer, director of planning, and
chief technology officer are
British. “I often get accused
of being an Anglophile,”
West confesses, “and there’s
some truth to that.”

West’s vision for his com-
pany five years from now is
to be a national profile firm
out of the southeast two-
and-a-half to three times the
size it is now. The agency’s
“Declaration of Intent,”
drafted last August, says in

part: “The West Group only
does great work....We have
and we seek only clients
who want great work. We
have and we hire only great
people....We are profitable.
We are philanthropic. Above
all, we are mavericks.”

West takes this stuff seri-
ously. His office shelf is
lined with many of the
Bibles of corporate manage-
ment by Tom Peters, John
Naisbitt, and others, and
coworkers’ nicknames for
him include “Zen Ben.”

“Ben takes a very active
involvement in client work,”
explains Rob Iles, West-
Group’s senior account plan-
ner, who joined the firm
from the Florida Lottery in

1991. “His role would be as
agency leader, but also chief
strategist, head thinker, cap-
tain of the cheerleaders
and...I think keeper of the
flame is a little idealistic,” he
laughs. Referring to the
vision statement, he adds,
“Ben has to be emblematic
of everything on that.”
WestGroup’s maverick
personality is evident in the
design of its Tampa head-
quarters, which it has occu-
pied since 1993. West hired
avant garde Miami design
firm Architectanica and let
them run wild within his
walls. “They had never done
an ad agency,” West ex-
plains, “and we wanted them
to give us our own feel and
That look
included circular quarters,

personality.”

one inside the other, and
WestGroup employees were
asked to bring in plates—
some of them custom-made,
others straight out of the
china cabinet—which line
the circular walls. “Clients
come up here and expect to
come into a different world,”
West says, and they do. So
many people were coming in
off the street to look at the
fish-tile mosaic, in fact, that
access to the 35th floor had
to be closed off to the public.

23

West moved his office
downstairs from the 36th
floor about 10 months ago to
be closer to the creative
heart of the agency. If
there’s a signature style to
WestGroup’s work, it’s a
high-end sheen that belies
its regional origins. Depend-
ing on the product, West’s
ads can be youthful or nos-
talgic, cutting-edge or main-
stream. For Outback Steak-
houses, the agency hired
supermodel Rachel Hunter
—who isn’t Australian but
sure as heck sounds the
part—and sold attitude with
its A-1, launching the up-
and-coming chain nationally.

They even found a way to
make condom use funny.
“The whole underpinning
for our [Sheik] condom cam-
paign came out of some con-
versations with college stu-
dents,” Iles explains. “Re-
gardless of disease issues,
they still like to have sex.
And you cannot preach the
gloom and doom.” If the
company’s tracking surveys
are any indication, Iles adds,
the Generation X spots have
been “fabulously successful.”

But advertising isn’t
everything. West enjoys a
solid reputation as a market
planner—defining the audi-

24

 

 

“Clients are very demanding,” West says. “Just as you get feeling
comfortable at one level, it ratchets up a notch.”

ence for the product and the
product for the audience.
“The field work is far and
away the most interesting
part of the job,” says Iles,
who wound his way through
crack- and prostitute-heavy
neighborhoods throughout
the South to study the
saliency of life insurance
itself among Independent
Life’s older and lower-mid-
dle-income clientele.

‘The approach is decided-
ly different with Celebra-
tion, Fla., the town that
Disney is building on about
5,000 acres in Osceola
County. What Disney is cre-
ating is not a development,
but a town—a self-govern-
ing, self-schooling, business

district-and-fire station-and-
golf course-and-espresso bar
town. Phase I, scheduled to
open in July 1996, will offer
350 to 400 homes, and Cele-
bration’s initial advertising
will target the Orlando and
Central Florida community,
incoming corporate reloca-
tions, and others who for
whom a significant lifestyle
change may dictate a change
in housing.

The Celebration account
will be a mix of roughly 70
percent advertising to 30
percent consulting for West-
Group, according to Iles. In
addition to developing a
clear brand image for
Celebration (much as Big
Blue is for IBM), the firm is

also charged with enhancing
Disney’s image in the Orlan-
do community, and, perhaps
most importantly, “drive
people through the gates
and sell houses,” Iles says,
The campaign, which em-
braces outdoor, radio, and
print media, will break some-
time this summer.

WestGroup was the only
Florida agency asked to bid
on the account, beating out
several New York heavy-
weights and regional giants.
The agency prevailed, Iles
believes, with a “stunning”
creative pitch and a strong
database component. “I
truly believe we demonstrat-
ed we knew the market.”

But there’s always the
next account. Advertising 1s
one of those trades where a
concept that was new and
exciting yesterday will be
tired and shopworn tomor-
row. Where money and mar-
ket share are at stake, clients
can be demanding, and there
are no certainties. But West
seems up to the challenge.

“Putting an ad out there
is like those salmon swim-
ming upstream—how many
of them will make it?” he
asks rhetorically. “It’s not fof
the faint of heart, that’s for
sure.” ®

In the 1990s, it’s the Information Revolution.
Guess which one means the bigger changes?

of Washington and Lee’s computer sys-

kind of inside joke that reminds all who
enter not only how far we’ve come, but
how impossible it would be to go back.

Unless you’ve spent the last five
years holed up in a VMI barracks, you
may have noticed that the inundation of

By William Cocke ’82

hype surrounding the arrival of the
information superhighway has reached
saturation level. Maybe you feel a little
like George Jetson on his out-of-control
space-age dogwalk at the close of every
episode, frantically shouting, “Jane, stop
this crazy thing!” But like any other
technological transformation, from the
wheel to the airplane, the computer has
become part of the fabric of everyday
life. We couldn’t stop this “crazy thing”
—not even if we wanted to.

As an institutional purveyor of infor-
mation, W&L has an opportunity to be
a leader in the rapidly evolving world of
information technology. And its director
of university computing, John Stuckey,
is someone who can not only steer the
course, but who can read the road signs
up ahead. “We need to focus our efforts
on arriving at the proper information
technology for a traditional liberal arts
institution,” he says. “We all realize that
Washington and Lee is no Carnegie
Mellon, MIT, or Cal Tech, but the
University can use information to do
better what it already does so well.”

Stuckey came to W&L nearly four
years ago from Northeastern University
in Boston, where he was director of aca-
demic computing. Prior to that, he was
director of computing at Carnegie
Mellon University’s College of Human-
ities and Social Sciences from 1980 to
1987. He held computer service posi-
tions at the University of Michigan and
the Berlin Science Center in Germany.

Yet the 52-year-old Stuckey, who has
a bachelor’s degree in international rela-

tions from the University of Kansas at
Lawrence and a master’s degree in
political science from the University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor, and who served
as a Foreign Service Officer in southeast
Asia, credits his computer expertise
with being at the right place at the right
time. “I was fortunate to have started
using computers at Michigan when the
technology began to explode,” he says.
“T also have a passion for helping people
learn how to use computers.”

Stuckey has three main constituen-
cies upon whom to practice his pas-
sion—students, faculty, and administra-
tion. “Since you’re no doubt aware of
our reputation for a solid, traditional
education in the liberal arts and the law,
you might find it surprising to think of
us as a high-tech place,” he writes in his
annual letter to incoming freshmen.
“We manage to use information tech-
nology to further our rigorous and
diverse curriculum in ways that would
make a technology institute jealous.”

Since 1992, each student has been
provided with his or her own E-mail
address, full access to networked cam-
pus resources, and a ticket to ride on the

26

global Internet. For those in the dormi-
tories, the student user is connected to
the campus network through a terminal
server from which the student can
choose such resources as the Law and
Leyburn Library’s electronic online
information system, Annie, and the
main campus UNIX server, dubbed
Liberty (after Liberty Hall). The latter
controls the student E-mail system and
is the gateway for access to Internet
resources from all over the world.

Students (as well as faculty and staff)
living elsewhere—whether it’s a frater-
nity house in Red Square or a rental
property at Goshen—are served by dial-
up modems connected to a terminal
server on the network. For those with-
out computers of their own, more than
150 computers in labs are scattered
about the campus, available for use by
any student when not otherwise needed
for class instruction.

In other words, combined with the
integration of faculty and administrative
computers into the system, the Univer-
sity community is now fully networked,
both internally and externally. Wash-
ington and Lee’s computers can talk to

each other and to other computers
throughout the world. “W&L was fully
connected to the Internet well before
most of its peers,” notes Stuckey,
adding that the resource has really blosl
somed in the last three years.

While a growing number of students
coming in are ready to push the limits of
the system, most student (and adminis-
trative) computing consists of sending
E-mail and word processing. The super-
highway is still so new that it is going to
take some time before everyone figures
out just how much juice they can really
get out of their system.

Not so the faculty. They’ve taken to
the network and embraced it whole-
heartedly. “I have faculty in every
department saying that they utterly
depend on computing for their teach-
ing,” says Stuckey. “It’s amazing when
highly literate people become aware
that they can suddenly discover things.
It’s part of the magic.”

President-elect John W. Elrod con-
curs: “Computers have become indis-
pensable to the instructional program at
Washington and Lee,” he says. “Soon
there will be no discipline taught here
that will not heavily rely upon the com-
puter for instructional purposes. It ts
transforming research as well.”

For teachers, particularly those in the
sciences, computers provide a painless
visual alternative to some of the build-
ing blocks of the curriculum. “If you
think I got into chemistry because I
loved to do all those equations, you Te
wrong,” says Steve Desjardins, associate
professor of chemistry. “If we can sub-
merge the tediousness in the depths of
the computer, so much the better. We
have just four years to put a lot of chem-
istry into a student’s head, so the com-
puter is helping us to figure out bettet,
quicker ways to teach things.”

No wooden ball and stick moleculaf
models in his chemistry class. Desjat
dins uses a software program called
HyperChem in his physical chemistty
courses, a molecular modeling guide

that allows students to construct any

molecule— |
reins—and manipulate them graphical-

“Ir used to be hard to explain how a
vibrated, for example,” he

-even complex ones like pro-

ly.
molecule

explains. “Now we can move them

around, animate them, and the students
can picture what was very difficult to
imagine before. It went from something
[| couldn’t explain to something that is
obvious to them.”

Thanks to HyperChem and a math-
ematics program called Maple, Des-
jardins and professor Mike Pleva can
offer Disorder and Chaos as a general
education course with no prerequisite.
“The mathematics behind chaos theory
is complicated,” he says, “but again, the
programs take away the theoretical
math and let students get a feel for the
equations and work with abstract ideas
that were formerly denied to all but the

most advanced chemistry students.”

When the frustration factor is taken
away and students are exposed to ideas
earlier, Desjardins thinks that they learn
better. “It’s like the difference between
painting a wall by hand and spraypaint-
ing it,” he explains. “The concept is the
same. Computers are simply tools that
augment our mental capacity.”

Over in the department of physics
and engineering, professor Robert Akins
punches a few keys and up on the
screen appears a moving graphic—a
plucked guitar string. Like his colleague
in the chemistry department, Akins
loves the way computer programs (in his
case Maple) can show complicated
problems that make sense visually.
“This is a fairly difficult equation to
resolve,” he says. “We couldn’t visual-
ize it before Maple and we certainly
couldn’t do a two-dimensional plot

an 150 computers in labs on campus. Some 67 percent of entering freshmen,

first-year law students, owned their own systems by registration day last fall.

 

before in the course of a normal class.”

Students in Akins’ physics classes
draw a lot of graphs—the end results of
difficult calculations. Graphs that would
have taken a week of laborious work to
complete can be done with Maple in
two minutes. “Students still have to do
the thinking,” he says. “They still have
to set up the equations but now they
can see the end results very quickly. If
an equation is wrong the picture will
show it. We can do things that could
never be done by hand in the amount of
time we have.”

So what the computers allow the stu-
dents to do is understand the math and
see its results without exhausting them-
selves in repetitive calculations. The
technology lets the computer help with
the tedious and the mechanical, freeing
the student to understand the theoreti-
cal and the general.

While professors such as Desjardins,
Akins, and others like associate psychol-
ogy professor Tyler Lorig (“Sniff ’n’
Scratch,” Winter 1995) are using com-
puters to expand the boundaries of the
classroom, two University librarians are
expanding its use as a research tool.
John Doyle, associate law librarian, and
Hugh Blackmer, assistant professor and
reference librarian, are pushing W&L to
the perimeter of the “bleeding edge,”
in info slang, of the Internet.

Doyle, in fact, has made W&L some-
thing of a celebrity in Internet circles.
He created the Netlink server, an index
of some 12,000 Internet resources that
fields about 45,000 requests a day from
users outside the University. He’s con-
stantly updating the server, adding
about 350 new sites a week (recent
additions include the University of
Goettingen, the Virtual Library of
Virginia, and Cyber Cyclery).

“It’s just a way of organizing re-
sources,” Doyle explains. “We're offer-
ing organization, and we're doing it
because no one else is.” With the whole
process of information categorization
under development, competing server

Associate law librarian John Doyle created the Netlink server, an index of some 12,000 Internet

resources that fields about 45,000 requests a day from users outside the | niversity.

options have emerged in the year since
Doyle developed the Netlink server.
Still, his system is the yardstick by
which the others are measured.
Amazingly, the man who made W&L
a hub of Internet activity is a self-taught
computer whiz; his training is not in
writing programs, but as a lawyer and
librarian. And he did it all in his spare
time, putting in 40-hour weeks at home
for the last couple of years to come up
with his system. “Right now, the Inter-
net is incredibly complex, chaotic,” he
says. “There’s so much volume it’s
humanly impossible to keep up with it
all.” With the Netlink server up and
running, he’s limiting himself to picking
the best new sites to add to the system.
In his spare time he’s gone decidedly
low-tech—he’s writing poetry instead.
“lohn is what I call the Geek—he’s
the one who knows the witchcraft, the
complicated stuff,” jokes Blackmer.
“I’m the Weenie—the one who, after it’s
set up, takes the time to explain it all.”
Blackmer is fast becoming the Univer-
sity’s Internet uncle, and it’s a role he
relishes. “The Internet is anarchy—you
have to impose order on it,” he says.

28

“All the time you're finding things,
putting them together, and they're out
there on a semi-permanent basis. When
you put things onto a server, your audi-
ence is the world.”

Increasingly, Blackmer assists other
faculty in integrating the Internet into
their classrooms. For Biology 182 (Use
and Understanding of Biological Liter-
ature), which is required for majors, he
helps access all the information neces-
sary for budding biologists: books, jour-
nals, databases. “Five years ago, this
resource was not here, and now we can't
do without it,” he says. “Biology, espe-
cially, is a discipline where the Internet
has solved the problem of quick
retrieval. Journals are too slow—for the
vast amounts of knowledge necessary to
keep current, the Internet is king.

“It’s a struggle just to keep abreast of
everything that’s out there,” he adds. “I
find it challenging to show people how
to get beyond the surface, into the
essence of the medium. In a way, this 1s
always how a librarian has worked. ‘The
whole electronic library thing is not
unlike what’s been going on historically,
but now it’s a library without walls.”

Given the enormity of his task,
Stuckey is fortunate to have these two
field-decorated veterans to augment his
staff of 12. He also acknowledges his
debt to the hierarchy he inherited from
his predecessor, Tom Imeson. Staff
members are still dedicated to academic
departments—there are four main diyj-
sions: law, sciences, humanities, and the
commerce school—each of which re-
ceives the ministrations of its own com-
puter center person. “Our people are
the key to what I'd like to think is our
unique success at W&L,” he says. The
same model is being adapted for admin-
istrative Computing.

With his far-flung lieutenants report-
ing back to him on the state of universi-
ty computing, Stuckey manages to keep
up with increasing demands being
placed on steadily aging equipment, and
relief has come from some unexpected
sources. Upon visiting Lexington a few
years ago, non-alumnus Charles Stein-
metz was inspired, out of his admiration
for Robert E. Lee, to offer several gifts
to the University. Steinmetz works for
the Hewlett-Packard Co. and over the
last couple of years, he has donated a
group of H-P printers and an advanced
graphics workstation to the department
of physics and engineering.

Last fall, Steinmetz and his employer
donated a Model E55 computer from
H-P’s 9000/800 series to the University,
augmenting the networked resources
already available at W&L. The $13,000
system, roughly twice as powerful as
Liberty, allowed the further division of
computing tasks among the UNIX
hosts, improving performance system-
wide as well as increasing gross capacity.
Joining an H-P network that includes
workstations with designations like
Liberty, Honor, and Justice, the gift is
officially known as Logic but is affec-
tionately nicknamed “Chuck.”

Even with these improvements;
Stuckey hopes to increase the system
flow from the current 56,000 bits pet
second to a faster 1.5 million by next
year. (Imagine trying to stuff a golf ball

-

‘nto a drinking straw.) The system is
é :

slow 4 ia
times get frustrated. “W&L has been
very successful in equipping faculty
with computers,” Stuckey says, “but

nd cranky, and its users some-

compute! lifespans now run in three-

vear cycles. An old computer is good for
word-processing and E-mail, but not
adequate for the expanding technology.”

With the more than 500 computers
that W&L owns scattered around cam-
pus, it costs about $500,000 a year just
to keep the system current. And that’s
nothing fancy, just replacing computers.
Meanwhile, the academic and adminis-
trative Primes—the mainframes behind
the glass—are already becoming more
dinosaur-like each day. Compared to
them, the Liberty system is the size of a
file cabinet and six times more power-
ful. Logic is even smaller.

“It’s ironic,” says Stuckey, “but the
easier a computer is to use, the more
complex it is to make—and more
expensive.” Endowment for the com-
puter center is a $4 million line item for
the Campaign for Washington and Lee,
and one of the University’s greatest
challenges in the coming years will be
not just to keep its computer technolo-
gy ahead of the curve but comparable to
that of its peer institutions. In addition,
Stuckey and his staff will have to not
only maintain this system, but will have
to make sure that its human component
is using it efficiently and with skill.

“The creativity and power and diver-
sity of W&L resides in its faculty and
students,” he says. “What I should be
doing is to get out of the way and pro-
vide them with the chance to do what
they do best—teach and learn.”

There’s a faculty kid named Andy
Jacob that Hugh Blackmer and other
“omputer people know. He’s 12 years
old and he already knows more about
the Internet than just about anyone on
“ampus. He, and hundreds of thousands

of kids like him, will be applying to col-
lege by the turn of the century.

They are already on the superhigh-
Way. It’s not hype to them. @

W&L Law

Clayton E. Williams began his long
legal career as a student at Washington
and Lee in 1908, graduating with a law
degree in 1912. A professor and dean at
W&L for 49 years, the Woodstock (Va.)
native retired in 1960 and remained on
the University faculty as a distinguished
lecturer in the law of property until his
death in 1968.

Williams’ successor as law dean,
Charles P. Light Jr., joined the W&L
staff in 1926 and retired from teaching
in 1973. During World War II, he took a
nearly six-year leave of absence for
active duty in the Judge Advocate
Generals’ Corps, rising to the rank of
full colonel by 1944. At the time of his
death in 1976, more than 100 of Dean
Light’s former students, who called
themselves the “Light Brigade,” held
federal judgeships and two of his stu-
dents were elected presidents of the
American Bar Association.

Catherine Feland McDowell was the
wife of beloved law professor Charles R.
McDowell. Known as “Mrs. Mac” to
generations of law students, McDowell
served as secretary to five law school
deans, including Williams and Light,
and was, for all intents and purposes, the
law school administration for 30 years.

Williams, Light, and McDowell each
made a lasting impression on the quality
of legal education at Washington and
Lee. It is only fitting, then, that the Law
Alumni Association honors their memo-
ries in the form of three full-tuition
scholarships to some of the law school’s
most promising legal minds:

Amanda Shaw wants to be a country
lawyer after she graduates, working for a
small firm in a rural area. “I want to help
the people who need it the most—to
fight the good fights,” says Shaw, a sec-
ond-year student and current holder of
the Clayton E. Williams Scholarship.

Shaw graduated cum /aude from
Harvard University as a government
major. Once she decided that she no
longer wanted to be U.S. ambassador to
China, she began to think about law

Second Thoughts on First Impressions
Why Three Honor Scholars Came to Washington and Lee

school. Through her cousin Emmitt
Yeary ’66L, who practices law in Abing-
ton, Va., Shaw became interested in
W&L. After visiting the law schools to
which she had been accepted, she came
away most impressed with W&L.
(Husband Joe, meanwhile, is enrolled in
graduate school at the University of
Virginia.) “It was obvious to me that the
W&L law school was ready and willing
to spend money on its students,” Shaw
says. “When they had more students
than carrels, they just built more carrels
and added more computers.

“It is a true learning atmosphere at
Washington and Lee,” she adds. “There
is not this sink-or-swim attitude that you
find at other schools. ‘The professors are
interested in teaching, not getting
caught up in their research with no time
for students.”

Ranji. M. Garrett entered college at
the age of 16 with intentions of being a
scientist. But when he got to the
University of South Carolina at Aiken,
he changed his focus to major in

English. ‘That set in motion his plans to
go to law school. “People who knew me
when I was young would be shocked to
know that I’m now in law school,” he
says. Garrett is the recipient of the
Charles P. Light Scholarship.

After graduating from USC-Aiken
magna cum laude in 1992, Garrett worked
as a reporter for the Aiken Standard fo,
two years, first in general assignment,
then covering public safety and legal
issues. He knew he was going on to law
school—his goal is to be elected state
prosecutor for the state of South
Carolina—but the experience of work-
ing those two years had a maturing
effect on him. “There was a lot I didn’t
know and a lot I needed to know,” he
says. “After working for a while I
became better at dealing with people.”

Garrett had already been accepted to
law school at the University of South
Carolina and the University of Georgia
when he heard from W&L. When he
was invited to honor scholars weekend
at the law school, he didn’t even want to
accept a free trip to Virginia, having
already decided to go to USC. “At the
urging of friends, | came anyway,” he
recalls. “I fell in love with the place, and
completely changed my mind.”

Finally, first-year student Tina M.
Clark is the recipient of the Catherine
F. McDowell Scholarship. A magna cum
Jaude and Phi Beta Kappa graduate of
the University of Connecticut, Clark
was invited to visit Lexington for an
honor scholars weekend. The lifelong
Connecticut resident was looking for a
change, and with relatives in Richmond,
living in Virginia appealed to her.

Clark majored in psychology as 4m
undergraduate. Her education prepared
her well for the rigors of that first year of
law classes—“Psychology teaches you ©
listen and listen carefully, to dig below
the surface”—but nothing quite pre
pared her for her first impressions of
Lexington. “I arrived on Easter Sul-
day,” she recalls, “and the school and
the town were deserted. I was staying

a

an historic country inn down-

Law School Ranks 21st
in U.S. News Survey

W&L moved up one notch, from 22
to 21, among law schools measured in
U.S. News © World Report's 1995 survey
of “America’s Best Graduate Schools.”

Law schools were ranked using five
criteria: student selectivity, placement
success, faculty resources and two sepa-
rate measures of institutional reputation
(one, using deans and faculty members;
the other, a survey of practicing lawyers,
hiring partners, and senior judges).
W&L fared best in faculty resources
(10th overall), which measures such fac-
tors and expenditures per student as
well as student-to-teacher ratio; and stu-
dent selectivity (19th), which measures
median undergraduate GPA, median
LSAT scores, and proportion of appli-
cants accepted. W&L also scored well in
the employment category, with 91 per-
cent of its graduates employed six
months after graduation.

“The real measures of a law school
are the quality of its faculty and stu-
dents, the rigor of the learning that goes
®n, and the professional competence
and integrity of its graduates,” says law
dean Barry Sullivan. “If you know our
faculty, Students, and graduates, you
= the kind of job we are doing at
Vashington and Lee. That’s the impor-
fant thing, but it’s reassuring when oth-

‘Compete on Principle,’
Guinier Tells Students

Minority rights activist Lani Guinier
addressed race relations before an audi-
ence in Lee Chapel Feb. 23 as part of
the University’s celebration of Black
History Month. Guinier’s talk was titled
“America’s New Policy on Civil Rights:
‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Don’t Pursue,’ ”
and her visit was sponsored by the
Minority Student Association, the Black

W&L Conferences Tackle
Law of the Sea Treaty,
Contingent Employment

 

“Our society exaggerates the importance of

winning,” Guinier told the WEL crowd.

Law Students Association, the ACLU,
and the politics department.

As reported by the Associated Press,
Guinier urged students to work toward
consensus opinions on issues such as
racial discrimination and affirmative
action and to “compete on principle, not
just on greed. Try to understand how
the losers must feel. Fight to resolve a
difference, not just win.”

Guinier is a professor of law at the
University of Pennsylvania and the
author of The Tyranny of the Majority:
Fundamental Fairness in Representative
Democracy. Best known for her contro-
versial nomination—subsequently with-
drawn—for assistant attorney general in
1993, she has become a leader of a new
movement for fairness and minority
rights as the founder of Commonplace, a
national nonprofit center designed to
connect citizens, communities, and
ideas. Guinier is also planning a series of
national conversations on race, the first
one to be held at the University of
Pennsylvania this fall.

In a word, the 1994-95 winter sports
season at Washington and Lee was a
splash. W&L’s swimming teams took
center stage all season long, capped off
by a fantastic showing at championship
time in February. But that was far from
all the excitement this winter for
W&L’s sports teams. ‘The men’s basket-
ball team gave departing head coach
Verne Canfield a wild final ride; the

32

 

women’s basketball team played over
the heads all year; the wrestling team
had several new faces making some
noise and the track teams gave a deter-
mined effort at the ODAC Indoor
Championships.

Vien’s Basketball

A late-season slide took some of the
luster off Canfield’s final season as
W&L’s coach, but the Generals’ final

effort was something special. The
Generals won just two of their fina] 10
games but took eventual ODAC cham-
pion and NCAA quarterfinalist Hamp-
den-Sydney to the wire in a 76-73 loss in
the ODAC Tournament to finish the
season at 10-15. Canfield recorded 469
wins and 337 losses in 31 seasons.

W&L opened its schedule with an
85-72 victory over 1994 NCAA quarterfj-
nalist Amherst and carried a 3-4 record
into the holiday break. After dropping
their first game back, the Generals
reeled off three straight wins, including
a 20-point win over archrival Roanoke
and a 126-121 win over Mary Washing-
ton in a game that broke two NCAA
records, including points in overtime by
one team and combined points by both
teams in overtime, and broke or tied
five W&L records. The Generals then
lost a pair of games before coming back
to beat Catholic and Bridgewater. The
Generals trailed Bridgewater by 15
points in the second half before rallying
for a 78-74 win that put W&L at 8-7
entering a three-game road trip. W&L
lost all three games away from home to
start their 2-8 stumble to the finish line.

Junior forward Cam Dyer ranked
among the league leaders in scoring
average (17.2) and rebounding (8.1 per
game) to earn second team All-ODAC
honors. Senior center Mark Connelly
was an honorable mention all-league
selection and was second behind Dyer
in scoring (11.9) and rebounding (6.7).

Women’s Basketball

W&L’s women’s basketball team
made its varsity debut last year with a
winning record of 11-10. The Generals
entrance into the rigorous waters of the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference was
not as successful, but the Generals
played admirably in a 6-18 season.

W&L’s biggest win of the season was
a 64-51 victory over eventual ODAC
runner-up Emory & Henry, but even if
defeat the Generals gained the respect
of their league counterparts. W&L
played several close games against
established ODAC programs, including
a stretch of three straight losses by 4
total of 16 points against Bridgewatels

—

Lynchburg and Virginia Wesleyan.

‘In addition to the win over Emory &
Henry, the Generals swept the season
es from
:dolph-Macon Woman’s College,

seri Hollins and picked up wins
over Ral 7
Chestnut Hill, and Mary Baldwin.

Junior co-captain Sandra Holmes was
W&L’s cop all-around player for the sec-
ond straight year and earned honorable

mention all-league honors after leading

the team in scoring average (12.8) and
rebounds (8.2 per game). Junior co-cap-
rain Allison Hull also had a big year and
led the team with 68 assists.

Men’s Swimming

Generals coach Page Remillard was
all smiles after his team’s second-place
finish at the Southern States Champion-
ship capped a highly successful season.
W&L went 6-1 in dual meets, with just
an eight-point loss to Johns Hopkins,
and was represented by five swimmers
at the NCAA championships in March.

W&L finished second to Davidson at
the Southern States meet, but more
than held its own as the only Division
III school in the 11-team field. The real
story of the meet for the Generals, how-
ever, was sophomore Nathan Hottle.
Hottle shattered school records in the
100-yard breaststroke (by more than 2
seconds) and the 200-yard breaststroke
(by better than 4.5 seconds) to automati-
cally qualify for the NCAA champi-
onships. Ac the time Hottle’s times were
the fastest in Division III for the season.

A number of other W&L swimmers
posted NCAA provisional qualifying
times at the meet and the trump card for
the Generals was the 400-yard freestyle
relay team being selected to the meet.
That allowed senior Tony Diederich
and junior Craig Sears to join Hottle,
Junior Frank Braden and junior David
Stillman at the NCAA meet. That also
allowed W&L to enter relay teams in
the meet for the first time since the
1988-89 team finished eighth at the
NCAA meet.

Women’s Swimming

The 19:

/S season was a year of streaks
for the W

&L women’s swimming pro-

gram. W&L won eight dual meets for
the third consecutive year and the
ODAC/Atlantic States Championship
for the second year running, while junior
Rebekah Prince earned first team All-
America honors for a third year in a row.

All totaled, nine different W&L
swimmers earned All-ODAC honors and
head coach Kiki Jacobs was named
Atlantic States Coach of the Year. Prince
was named the ODAC Swimmer of the
Year for the second time in her career
and her fourth place finish in the 200-
yard backstroke at the NCAA meet was
her best ever.

W&L’s eight wins tied the school
record for a season and a late-season
weather cancellation against Radford
probably denied the Generals from
breaking that mark. Among W&L’s
most impressive wins during the season
was an upset win over Catholic and a
win over Jacobs’ @/ma mater, Dickinson.

VMien’s Indoor Track

W&L was hopeful of ending Lynch-
burg’s run of ODAC titles, but things
didn’t go the Generals’ way at the
ODAC Indoor meet which was hosted
by W&L at VMI in late February. W&L
finished third behind Lynchburg and

Bridgewater.

W&L had several outstanding indi-
vidual performances, led by junior
Harris Morrison who won the pole vault
and placed fifth in the long jump.
Freshman Will Olson won the 3,000-
meter run and W&L’s 3,200-meter relay
team of Todd Burkey, Taylor Shultz,
Grant Cowell, and Greg Ruthig was
likewise victorious. W&L also got sec-
ond-place finishes from Cowell in the
800 and Shultz in the 1,500.

Women’s Indoor Track

This was supposed to be the year for
W&L’s women’s track team to finally
get its due. The ODAC sponsored
women’s track as a championship sport
for the first time this winter and W&L
had dominated the league’s invitational
in years past. But a rash of injuries to
key personnel was too much to over-
come as Lynchburg edged the Generals.

‘There were performances worth not-
ing. Senior Sue Deutsch was W&L’s top
finisher at the meet, winning the 800-
and 1,500-meter runs, and she helped
the 3,200-meter relay team to victory.
Freshman Maren Wright won the 3,000-
meter run; the 1,600-meter relay team
was also victorious; and senior Sarah
Gilbert placed in high jump, triple
jump, and 55-meter hurdles.

Grudge match: Senior grappler Robert Hull
(right) squares off against a heavyweight
opponent. The football All-American and
former high school state wrestling champion
went 15-9 for the Generals this season.

Wrestling

W&L’s wrestling program began
making positive strides last winter and
head coach Gary Franke hoped the
addition of football All-American Robert
Hull to the heavyweight roster would
complete a highly competitive squad.
But luck was not on the Generals’ side,
and W&L’s top three wrestlers from last
year were all gone by season’s end.

Cole Van Nice, W&L’s wins leader
in 1994 at 190 lbs., suffered a major
knee injury in the off-season which has
likely ended his wrestling career. Senior
captain Eric Shirley, an academic all-
state pick last year, was ahead of sched-
ule to graduate, so he took the winter
term off. And finally, senior captain
Adam Williams spent the semester stu-
dent teaching in Roanoke and was only
able to wrestle one weekend.

Still, the emergence of Hull was a
major bright spot for the Generals. ‘The
former high school state champion from

Lexington led the team with a record of
15-9, highlighted by a runner-up finish

Hull also placed fourth at the NCAA

Freshman Doug Panzer also posted a
winning record with a 6-5 mark in the
150-lb. class. W&L also got consistent
efforts from junior Rob deClerk, who
posted eight wins in the 142-pound
weight class, and junior 190-pounder

Smart Jock

Graig Fantuzzi ‘96 bats
over .400 on the field
_-and better than 4.0
in the classroom

Graig Fantuzzi’s grade-point average
has been slowly falling over his first
three years at Washington and Lee. But
there have been no raised eyebrows, no
lectures from home, and no anxious
meetings with advisors. But it’s not
because nobody cares—it’s because his
GPA has fallen from a 4.330 to a 4.187.
Yes, that’s right—a 4.187.

Fantuzzi, who was recently one of
just 15 junior inductees into Phi Beta
Kappa, has never received a grade lower
than an A and received no grade other
than A+ his freshman year. He hasn't
exactly backed into his No. 1 standing
in the junior class, either. He’s a double
major in business administration and
engineering, majors that don’t exactly
share the same course requirements—
“absolutely nowhere,” by Fantuzzi’s
own admission. “I’ve had to overload
most semesters and take some classes in
the summer.”

This, despite the 24 Advanced Place-
ment credits he had when he arrived at
W&L after graduating as class valedicto-
rian at Toms River (N.J.) South High
School. In fact, those A.P. credits afford-
ed him the opportunity to pursue the
dual majors.

So now you're thinking, this guy’s a
bookworm with no interests outside of
the classroom, right? Think again. All
Fantuzzi did while getting straight A+’s
that freshman year was start all nine
Sames for the football team as a defen-
sive back, take a couple of months off,
and then take over as the ace of the
pitching staff on the baseball team.

Fantuzzi’s athletic background comes
from his father, Al, who played _ profes-
‘tonally in the Brooklyn Dodgers organi-
ation and is presently coaching baseball
at Ocean County College. His academic
background is in the genes: His three
brothers and sisters all graduated in the

Sai

 

 

easy decision: “I don’t
want to be labeled as a
quitter—which is what
I did—but I wanted to
enjoy what I was doing,
and there
enough time for every-
thing.”

Anybody’s lingering
doubts about his tenac-
ity were erased last
baseball season. After
starting off the season
on fire, allowing just
four hits in 12 innings
pitched while striking
out 11 batters for a 0.75
earned run average,
Fantuzzi threw his arm
out. “I was depressed

 

wasn't

because I wasn’t help-
ing the team,” he
recalls. “I wanted to
make a contribution,
but I couldn’t throw.”
So he began concen-

 

Fantuzzi lettered in three sports in high school, played on three

state championship teams, and was class valedictorian to boot.

top ten in their high school class.
“People on the outside think my par-
ents must have really pushed us, but it
wasn’t like that,” he says. “They gave us
a lot of freedom. We all worked so hard
because we wanted to please them.”

At Toms River South, he would have
made any parent proud. In addition to
being class valedictorian, Fantuzzi
starred in football, basketball, and base-
ball and was named high school athlete
of the year by the Asbury Park Press. He
led his school to two state champi-
onships in baseball and one in football.
Consequently, his college choices were
wide open. “I wanted to go to a school
where I could concentrate on academics,
but still play sports,” said Fantuzzi.
“One of the good things about W&L is
it gives you the opportunity to fit a lot of
things into your schedule.”

Fantuzzi found the load a little too
heavy though and stopped playing foot-
ball after his freshman year. It wasn’t an

trating on his swing
and returned to the
diamond in the out-
field. “We thought
he'd help us defensive-
ly covering a lot of
ground,” says head coach Jeff Stickley,
“but we didn’t expect him to hit .400 by
any stretch.”

In fact, Fantuzzi shattered the
school’s hitting record with a .482 aver-
age, picking up first team All-Old
Dominion Athletic Conference and all-
state honors. He was also named to the
GTE Academic All-America second
team. Fantuzzi was as surprised as any-
one by his success: “Some people start
maturing at age 20—I told people that
my swing matured at age 20,” he jokes.

After a comparatively slow start this
year, Fantuzzi has come on recently,
and the Generals have an eye on quali-
fying for the ODAC tournament for the
first time since it switched to a four-
team format four years ago. “I sense a
big attitude change,” says Fantuzzi of a
team that has started the same nucleus
for the last three seasons. “We realize
that if we’re ever going to do anything,
then this is the year.” —By Brian Logue

When you're a newly arrived fresh-
man at Washington and Lee and just
finding your way around—meeting your
roommate, making new friends, or sim-
ply piling up dirty laundry—chances are
the phrase “alumni-in-residence” has
little meaning to you. Then, during a
Freshman Orientation barbecue at the
Liberty Hall ruins, you get your first
taste of class unity. You learn the words
to the “Swing.” And you see a bunch of
upperclassmen who look like they know
what they're doing.

In other words, you've just met the
members of Kathekon.

The concept of a student alumni
group is not unique to Washington and
Lee. When then-associate alumni direc-
tor Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins °68 and
alumni director Dick Sessoms attended
a workshop sponsored by the Council
for the Advancement and Support of
Education in Colorado 10 years ago,

36

they were introduced to the concept on
other campuses and envisioned such a
group at the University. ‘That same year,
Ben Hale °85 was taking a semester off
and working in the alumni office as the
first unofficial staff associate. ‘Together
these three men developed what is now
Kathekon (from a Greek word meaning
“to serve”).

With Hale’s help, the alumni staff
hand-picked its first group from leaders
of various student organizations.
Kathekon’s first president, Jim Kerr ’86,
was elected in the alumni office equiva-
lent of a smoke-filled room—the result
of “a hasty nomination by Ben Hale, by
a quick ‘second’ jointly by Dick
Sessoms and Buddy Atkins, and dazed
affirmation by the rest of the crew,” as
he remembers it. Although Sessoms,
Atkins and Hale had long-term goals for
the organization, it was not clear in the
beginning what Kathekon was going to

Dg 76 se] glesanae , fn ang 07
/}j 45, GANG ESTELLE IQiT associah CAN Vain

94.

be. In the end, Kerr says, “we had a
great deal of fun and I hope made some
contributions.”

Kathekon today consists of 26 juniors,
seniors, and law students representing a
wide variety of organizations on campus.
New members are no longer hand-
picked by the alumni office, but are
selected following an interview process
and careful consideration by current
members. “The successful candidates
must reflect the true Washington and
Lee spirit and show their dedication to
the University,” says current president
Richard Cummins "95,

That dedication manifests itself in
traditions past and present. Periodically,
Kathekon will post “Speak—Continue
the Tradition” signs on campus; during
matriculation this year, members hand-
ed out cards printed with the same mes-
sage and the words to the “Swing.” And
in 1992, hearkening back to a bygone

—

ra when students paraded through
e

Lexington
ing football game, Kathekon president

Tom Hooper °93 revived the Home-

on the eve of the homecom-

coming Parade, and the coveted Mink
crophy that is awarded to the winning
float sparks fierce but friendly competi-
rion among student organizations.

As senior year flies by and graduation
nears, Kathekon steps up its involve-
ment with the senior class. The annual
Bridge the Gap party, promoting inter-
action between the senior class and the
law school, enjoys a large turnout each
fall, while Kathekon also sponsors a
senior class reception at the end of win-
rer term. During Alumni Weekend,
seniors attend the reunion dance as their
first official alumni event. Once spring
term rolls around, “some seniors may
feel that this is the beginning of the end
of their college career,” says Kathekon
vice president Sarah Tune "95. “Kathe-
kon wants seniors to see that it is the
beginning of a long, lasting relationship
between their class and the University.”

At first, Kathekon members dis-
cussed campus life with the Alumni
Board and solicited Annual Fund
pledges from the senior class prior to
graduation. In the years since, Kathe-
kon’s mission has expanded to include
direct interaction with visiting alumni.
Morgan Warner Fuller ’92, a former
Kathekon vice president and now an
instructor of chemistry at W&L,
recounts the group’s involvement with
the Alumni College Theatre Weekend
one spring: “Instead of participating in a
single panel discussion, or showing up
for a single event or cocktail party, stu-
dents had the opportunity to serve more
like hosts and hostesses by spending an
entire weekend with Alumni College
Participants.” As a consequence, she
says, “The weekend provided the time
and vehicle for friendships to grow and
Perspectives to be exchanged between
Students and alumni.”

Kathekon continues to foster this
‘ype of interaction between students
and alumni during Homecoming and
Alumni eekends, Board of Trustees
and Alumni Board meetings, and Class
Agents Weekend. “I hope that when I
“ome back for Alumni Weekend that |

can be as enthusiastic about returning to
W&L as the alumni I have met,” says
junior Kathekon member Betsy Blunt.
After graduation, many Kathekon
members have taken leadership roles in
their alumni chapters and have served as
phonathon callers, chapter officers, or
class agents. Devon McCallister °92 is
president of the New York alumni chap-
ter; Chris Pennewill ’90 is an officer in
the Florida West Coast chapter; and
Alexa Salzman °89 and Dallas Hagewood
90 are on the Alumni Board of Directors.
“Service to the University following

graduation is simply the next step in
Kathekon membership,” says founding
member Lee Hollis *86. It’s a sentiment
echoed by ACAP volunteer Edwin Park-
inson °87: “Because I was already a part
of the system, it was much more natural
to volunteer early.”

And while other recent alumni, such
as Beeville (Texas) resident Raymond
Welder °91, are a little out of the loop
geographically for most alumni activi-
ties, the spirit of service is alive and
well. In Welder’s words, “I’m willing to
‘Kathekon it’ in any way I can.”

Board member Walter Blake ’72, chapter

Dallas’ selection as large chapter of the year.

Dallas, Charlotte Honored
As Top Alumni Chapters

Two cities high on anybody’s “hot”
lists can add another accolade. Dallas
and Charlotte were recognized on Jan.
19 and 20, respectively, as W&L’s large
and small! chapters of the year.

“Over the last few years, we have
seen the emergence of a new generation
of leadership in Dallas,” says director of
alumni programs Jim Farrar ’74. Alumni
like Sam Dalton °85, Dwight Emanuel-
son ’84, Anthony Interrante °84, ‘Tommy
McBride 88, and Mike Wyatt °84, he
says, “have created a new level of é€ner-
gy within the chapter, which is mani-
fested in strong student recruitment and
well-balanced chapter programs.” In
addition, the 10-year-old Dallas Scholar-
ship effort is nearing completion under
the hand of crackerjack fundraiser
McBride and his fellow officers. “They
represent W&L well,” Farrar adds, “and
they have great potential for the future.”

Charlotte’s recognition is direct testi-
mony to a chapter reorganization effort
nN 1991 and the extraordinary alumni
Participation in efforts such as last year’s
Annual Fund drive (an eye-popping 73
Percent). Under the leadership of Phifer
Helms °74, Scott Adams "86, Garrett
Moseley °88, and John Cleghorn °84,

the Charlotte chapter has literally
€xploded at a rapid pace,” Farrar says,

a the University is well aware of
arlotte’s emergence as a major attrac-
tlo . ;

N for new grads and young alumni.”

ank Woods’ School lies

Washington and Lee has always held a special place in the hearts

of Anne and Hank Woods ‘42, but they were so busy raising three
children and tending to business interests ranging from retail sales to
oil wells and mining that it wasn’t until Hank’s 50th reunion three
years ago that the couple found the time to return to campus. [he
renewal of friendships that occurred was like magic, and since then
the Woods have participated in Alumni College programs both on and
off campus, becoming acquainted with the University’s faculty and
acquiring new friends among our alumni. They have since retired to
Gulf Shores, Ala., to enjoy the climate and to spend more time on the
golf course. (A golfer with a handicap in the single digits, Hank annu-
ally participates in the Senior Masters ‘Tournament in Palm Springs.)

The Woods have generously engaged in two income-retained gift
arrangements with W&L. One arrangement provides for growth in
income over time whereas the other offers a fixed, dependable income
stream. Both plans featured the avoidance of capital gains tax on the
transfer of highly appreciated assets, a substantial current charitable
income t&x deduction, and the effective removal of the value of the
appreciated assets from their taxable estate. Interestingly, they have
also initiated another arrangement that replaces for their children the
value of some of the assets transferred to the two trust arrangements.
This particular arrangement is known as a wealth replacement trust.
With a portion of the new and higher income they receive from the
fixed-income plan, a trustee purchases life insurance that will provide,
upon the death of the survivor of Hank and Anne, a very handsome
benefaction for their heirs. The net result of this entire plan is a hand-
some endowment-oriented gift to W&L one day, a much larger
income than that originally provided by the dividends received from
the stock they used to hold, and a lovely gift to their children.

Once again, Washington and Lee’s future has been brightened due
to the generosity of “family” members in such a way as to enhance
their own situation and that of their children. (Uncle Sam ts the only
loser.) Indeed, the Woods’ example demonstrates that thoughtful
planning can result in the establishment of a true legacy at this old
school that will touch the lives of subsequent generations of students.
My colleagues and I celebrate their loyalty and affection for the
University’s hallmark traits of honor, integrity and service to others.

Please do contact me if you'd like to learn more about the methods
the Woods employed in making their gifts.

Sam Rayder, Still Smokin

Sam Rayder ’30L grew up in southeast Arkansas in a town
called Watson, population 300, where school didn’t go past ninth
grade and the bank was a one-room house—“and I mean small,”
he recalls. “No facilities, no electricity, no telephone, no nothing.”
At age 15, “still in knee
pants,” Rayder became
head cashier—while his
predecessor went off to
raise cotton during
World War I.

In 1920, Rayder
closed the bank for

 

three days to attend a
state bankers conven-
tion in Little Rock.
“My luggage was what
[ had on—I didn't
know any different,”
he says. But the trip
opened his eyes: “If I
didn’t get an education
I figured I'd be looking
a mule in the ass plow-
ing cotton.”

So Rayder wrote a
well-to-do cousin in
Little Rock to ask if he

could live with them

 

while he went to high
school. In Little Rock,
James H. Penick °19

took Rayder under his wing and in 1924 sent him to Washington

A man and his lap dog: Sam Rayder ’30L is
now 93, while Digger is 63 in people years.

and Lee on a one-year, Little Rock alumni scholarship. He didn’t
fit in right at first—19-inch leg bottoms were in at the time—but
he got a job at Rockbridge National Bank and put himself through
school, graduating with a law degree in 1930. He worked at the
bank (later United Virginia Bank, now Crestar, a name that
“sounds like a toothpaste,” he says) until 1970, when he retired as
president at age 68.

Rayder’s service to the University knows few peers. He was
student body treasurer for 46 years and kept the books for W&L’s
social fraternities for 25 years. In 1931, he sold 18 bonds valued at
$1,000 each to build the Sigma Chi house after the old house
burned down (“Washington and Lee took 12, and I got the alumni
to pick up the others”). His years of dedication were recognized by
the student body four times altogether, with a key in 1938, a
Revere bowl in 1955, and two silver cigar boxes after that.

Sam Rayder is 93 now. His wife of 64 years, Mayree, is in a rest
home, and Rayder shares his home with his faithful dog, Digger,
and a cat that his daughter gave him. But he still smokes 12 to 15
small cigars a day—a habit he picked up when he and classmates
Allen Penick and Maury Arnd studied together for exams in
1930—and Rayder’s regrets in life are few, although he sometimes
wishes he had heeded the advice of William A. Anderson 1861L, a
trustee of W&L, Civil War veteran, and director of Rockbridge
National Bank. Anderson told him to get out of banking and go
with an insurance company: “He told me, ‘“That’s where the
money is,’ but I didn’t listen to him.”

Sull, things didn’t turn out so bad—remember the mule—and a
visit with Sam Rayder is still like a good cigar.

A Tree Grows in Brookneal

When Susan and John Mullin ’63 lived in New York City, they wor-
ried about things like drugs and crime. Now that they own a nursery
about an hour south of Lynchburg, Susan says, times have definitely

changed: “Now we're worried about yellow-bellied sapsuckers.”

 

 

Green acres: John and Susan Mullin take a rooting interest in WEL.

Back in 1989, John Mullin traded the ups and downs of Wall Street
to return to his roots—or rather, Susan’s. After a 20-year career in
investment banking, he retired as managing director of Dillon, Read
& Co. in New York to open a commercial nursery in Brookneal, Va.,
specializing in shade and ornamental trees. Ridgeway Farm Inc. is
located in Charlotte County, on the banks of the Staunton River. On a
knoll above the river sits their home, a restored farmhouse which has
been in Susan’s family for many years.

The farm has 12 full-time employees and 3,000 partially wooded
acres, with about 500 acres of open fields and 200 planted in nursery
stock. The Mullins sell mostly wholesale to corporate and institutional
clients—those are Ridgeway trees planted along the newly completed

Lynchburg expressway—so they try to stock whatever is popular with

landscape architects at the moment. They have 24 different kinds of

maples and several types of flowering pear and cherry, all perennial
landscape favorites. “Spring is our busiest time of the year,” Mullin
says as he passes a giant machine designed to dig out trees—rootball
and all—that can weigh as much as 3,500 Ibs. “We have a three-to-
four-week window to get our trees out of the ground and shipped off.”

A trustee since 1991, Mullin was actively involved with Fraternity
Renaissance and donated a number of Bradford pears when the hous-
es were renovated. From there the idea blossomed into a five-year
commitment to replacing trees all across campus, including the trees
surrounding the Watson Pavilion and many of the trees that will sur-
round the finished science center. W&L’s Frank Parsons °54 estimates
the Mullins’ gift will translate to roughly 250 new trees over five years.

“There is a real need for Washington and Lee to continue to renew
its landscape, to replace the inevitable loss of older trees,” Mullin
says. He credits W. Thomas Borellis, partner in GWSM Inc., a Pitts-
burgh landscape architecture firm, and Chris Wise, assistant foreman
and arborist on W&L’s buildings and grounds crew, with making his
unusual gift work. The Mullins have carried out similar projects at
Susan's @/ma mater, Hollins, and son Harrison’s high school a/ma mater,
Woodberry Forest. “College and prep school campuses are like mini-
arboreta,”’ Mullin adds. “Each one is unique, and each one needs to
replace trees.” As the pear trees along Henry Street burst into bloom,
everyone who loves W&L can thank John and Susan Mullin for a gift
that will bear fruit for years to come.—By William Cocke ’82

Justin S. Walker "90 may be 26, but he can still pass for 17. In his
case, that’s a good thing, because as an actor, every role he gets falls
into that category.

Unless you've a patron of the New York theater or caught his ads
for Pepsi and Eastpak on TV, or remember his work as a student at
Washington and Lee, you may not have seen Walker until now. The

 

Body of work: “I'm a little old to be in Teen Beat,” says Walker, who plays
Alicia Silverstone’s love interest in Clueless. The film is due out in July.

Boston native makes his big-screen debut this summer opposite MTV
ingenue Alicia Silverstone (she’s the girl in the Aerosmith videos) in
the comedy C/ueless. “It’s a slice of life of wealthy teenagers in Beverly
Hills,” he says, “with a bit more of a witty, dark side than ‘Beverly
Hills 90210.’ ” ‘The Paramount film—formerly titled / was a Teenage
Teenager—is scheduled for nationwide release July 28.

As a student at W&L, Walker majored in English, took some acting
classes, and performed in student productions of Arden of Feversham
and Romeo and Juliet. But it was his experience as an apprentice with
the prestigious Williamstown (Mass.) Theater Festival between his
junior and senior year that convinced him to pursue acting as a career.
After graduating from W&L, he moved to New York and took a very
small apartment in Greenwich Village. (Later, he got an apartment on
Park Avenue.) Within five months, he was on the Broadway stage in
Neil Simon’s Lost in Yonkers.

Then he began studying acting under instructor Maggie Flannigan
at the William Esper Studio. “That really took me to another level in
my craft,” he says. He worked off-Broadway, landed the occasional
T'V commercial, and did some theater work in New Jersey. Along the
way he caught the eye of a woman named Randi Ross at an agency
called Epstein Wycoff. About three weeks later, she submitted him
for Clueless. Walker auditioned in New York for executive producer
Scott Rudin (The Firm, Regarding Henry) and writer-director Amy
Heckerling (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who’s Talking), who
subsequently flew him to Los Angeles for a second audition and a
screen test. Five days later, he reported for work.

The transition from stage to film wasn’t difficult. “I was lucky
enough to work with some very talented people,” Walker says. Now
he’s getting settled in Los Angeles, looking for his next job, and “hap-
pily” pursuing an apartment with his girlfriend. “We met in a restau-
rant in New York City,” he explains. “We moved out here together,
and she’s pursuing a career in wardrobe in film.”

After five years in the business now, Walker has earned the right to
be introspective. “I feel like I’ve definitely paid some dues,” he says.
“But I’m lucky enough to have advanced relatively...” He searches
for the right word. Unscathed? “Yeah,” he says. “Exactly.”

on March 5, 1995. He was 84. A
native of Floyd County, Va., he
received his early education in the
Floyd County, Botetourt County,
and Roanoke City School Systems.
He continued his studies at Virginia
State Normal School (Virginia State
University) and Tennessee State
University. Claytor raised hogs and
cattle on his 310-acre farm near
Buffalo Forge in Rockbridge
County for more than 20 years, and
he also served the area as an insur-
ance agent and funeral director. He
was married to the former Christine
Williams, who died in 1974. In 1980,
he honored his wife and father with
the creation of the Christine and
Solon Claytor Scholarship Fund at
Washington and Lee.

One great song! Ten timeless artists!
it’s the ‘W&L Swing’ on compact disc

It’s the most popular college fight song of the 20th century.
It’s been recorded by many of the biggest bands of them all—
from Gene Krupa and Kay Kyser to Rudy Vallee and His
Connecticut Yankees. And now the “Washington and Lee
Swing”—10 versions in all—is available on compact disc and
tape in time for Alumni Weekend.

For WEL I Yell: The Washington and Lee Swing and Other

Lexington Favorites contains versions of the instantly recogniz-
able tune done by Krupa, Kyser, and Vallee, as well as other
musical luminaries as Tex Beneke and the Miller Orchestra,
Hal Kemp, and the Nicky Dixieland Jazz Band. And if that
weren't enough, consider this: The 31-minute disc contains
bonus renditions of “College Friendships” by Krupa; “The
Washington and Lee Hymn (1956) and (1993),” and even
“VMI Spirit” (the flipside of Kemp’s single, distributed by
Weinberg’s Music Store of Lexington).

With the blessing of the Alumni Association, W&L junior
Richard Weaver of Vero Beach, Fla., assembled the compila-
tion from a collection of 78s and LPs donated to the University
by the Hon. Bleakley James ’50L prior to his death last year.
The broadcast journalism major read about the gift in the
Alumni Magazine (Summer 1994) and thought that the time was
right for a compilation. Once he was given the go-ahead from
professor of journalism and mass communications Bob de
Maria and associate director of alumni programs Rob Mish °76,
Weaver then remastered the old vinyl recordings using DAT

Hats off: Weaver makes things “Swing” again. Below: the CD itself.

 

technology—with a few snaps, crackles, and pops left intact for
nostalgia’s sake—under the direction of Lenfest Center techni-
cal director Gary Humiston. He then negotiated and signed a
deal with a New Jersey tape and compact disc manufacturer in
January. Approximately 2,000 copies of the CD and tape will
be available following Alumni Weekend—first as a favor to
those returning for their reunions in May, and subsequently
through the Alumni Office, the Washington and Lee Book-
store, and local retail outlet Night Owl Music. All profits will
go back to the University.

Written in 1910 by alumni Mark Sheafe °06, Thornton W.
Allen °13, and Clarence A. Robbins °11, the “Washington and
Lee Swing” is used by countless high schools and more than
two dozen colleges and universities as their fight song, accord-
ing to Don Betterton, author of A/ma Mazer, a book on college
trivia. The ubiquitous tune may be the only college fight song
ever used as the official theme for a presidential campaign (by
John W. Davis 1892, 1895L in his unsuccessful Democratic bid
in 1924).

Even though he won’t see a penny from his efforts, Weaver
has the satisfaction of preserving a bit of history—and it’s not a
bad thing to put on his resume. “I’m just pleased to have all
these songs together on one disc.”
