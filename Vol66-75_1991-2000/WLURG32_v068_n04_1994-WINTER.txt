From the Alumni President

College Friendships

In the Fall issue of the A/umni Magazine, associate
alumni director Rob Mish ’76 wrote a column address-
ing the importance of W&L class unity. As I read the
column, I began to focus on a few fundamental facts
about student life at W&L that I had not clearly
reflected on before.

Class togetherness begins at freshman orientation.
Soon after, students become assimilated into the frater-
nity and sorority social structure and they join athletic
teams, drama and singing groups, and other student
organizations. As a result, class awareness becomes less

 

prominent over the following three years.

When we become alumni, however, our graduating class re-emerges as the essen-
tial bond on which our continued involvement with the University depends. Yearly,
we express ourselves financially through a class agent system which is essential to the
success of the Annual Fund. Every five years class reunions are held which have
become increasingly more successful in attracting returning alumni to the campus.
But what do we know about each other in those years between reunions or, in many
cases, the years since graduation? Only what we are willing to send voluntarily to the
Class Notes section of the magazine. And, frankly, only a small percentage seem will-
ing to send information.

In order to improve our class communication system and thereby strengthen our
class awareness we are in the process of appointing class chairs who in time will, with
the assistance of W&L’s alumni office, publish occasional newsletters devoted strictly
to news about the various classes. You should find this information enjoyable reading
and we are hoping each of you will contribute something to the process. Many univer-
sities have found this to be a very successful method of keeping alumni constituen-
cies informed and involved.

Another opportunity for each of us to reunite with our classes occurs on Alumni
Weekend held each year in May. This year, on the weekend of May 12-14, reunions
will be held for undergraduate and law classes of 1944, °49, ’54, ’59, °64, 69, ’74, 79,
84. and ’89. The University, through its very able staff, produces an excellent series
of events and programs which are enlightening and very enjoyable. And, of course,
the students, through fraternity and sorority activities, provide their share of excite-
ment for those who are strong enough to participate! I urge you to attend a reunion
weekend when your class is honored. I know you will be pleased with the experience.

In summary, please respond when your class agent and class chair communicate,
come to your next class reunion, and give us some news about yourself. Your alma
mater will be stronger because of your participation and you will realize how reward-
ing renewing old bonds can be.

Dean Farrar Remembered

It was with great sadness that I
learned of Jim Farrar Sr.’s heart attack
and then his untimely death. W&L has
lost a great man and I have lost a great
friend. I remember my first visit to
W&L as a high school junior. My dad
and I sat in Jim Farrar’s office and dis-
cussed my application and my reasons
for wanting to attend W&L. I knew
when I left that weekend that I had
found the right college.

Jim Farrar, in a manner of speaking,
opened the door to the rest of my edu-
cational life. Jim Farrar believed in me
and I never forgot that. I came to know
him as a friend as well as his entire fami-
ly. His son Jimmy was a classmate and
fraternity comrade. W&L left an indeli-
ble impression on my life.

Jim Farrar was one of the giants of
W&L—yes, right alongside the
Starlings, Shillingtons, and all the oth-
ers, each with their own strengths and
gifts and manner of encouragement.
Much has happened in my own life
since those days in Lexington. Surely
Jim is with the everlasting Father and |
look forward with great anticipation to
our reunion.

Rick McCain °74
Columbia, §.C.

Whenever I recall my happy
Washington and Lee years in the late
’60s, the first images that come to mind,
after those of the beauty of the campus
and surrounding countryside, are of cer-
tain people. Invariably Jim Farrar Sr. is
among these. Alongside Coach Lee
McLaughlin and a number of wonderful
teachers, I always think of Dean Farrar.

For four years I worked for him in the
dean’s office in Washington Hall. He
was unfailingly friendly, upbeat, cheer-
ful, and interested in people. He was a
great conversationalist who was happy to
talk with you about anything from sports

to literature to politics to the state of the
University. Never once did I observe
him treat anyone without courtesy and
respect. Dean Farrar was truly a Wash-
ington and Lee gentleman and an ideal
director of admissions.

There were several of us at that time
who while playing on the football team
spent our summers at Coach Mac’s
Camp Maxwelton, where we first got to
know Jimmy and Scottie Farrar. ‘These
included Jay Clarke, Luke Crosland, Jay
Meriwether, and me. Jim Farrar was so
kind to us in so many ways. More than
once, he and Mrs. Farrar entertained us
in their home with the warmest of easy-
going hospitality. He took a genuine
personal interest in us and we knew
he’d be there enthusiastically pulling for
us each Saturday in the fall.

Dean Farrar is one of my all-time
favorite Washington and Lee people.
He had a permanent positive influence
on me and is synonymous in my mind
with everything that is good about our
University. I will miss him.

Rufus D. Kinney 69

It would be superfluous to recount
the many contributions of Jim Farrar Sr.
to Washington and Lee during the last
half century. He was, in a nutshell, “Mr.
W&L.” No single person more epito-
mized what W&L is, and what W&L
wants to be, than Jim Farrar. His sudden
death last August has left a huge void in
the W&L world, one that may never be
filled.

Thank you, Dean Farrar, for every-
thing.

Of Minor Wisdom...

I read with much interest the article
“Let’s Count All the Lawyers” (Fall
1993). The section on Hunton &
Williams refers to prominent alumnus
Matt Calvert ’75, ’79L as “one of the
last clerks for distinguished Federal

 

Judge Minor Wisdom ’25.”

I had the pleasure of clerking for
Judge Wisdom the same year Matt dig
(1979-80), and I learned much from
Matt (including a little law). Matt woul
be the first to tell you, however, that he
was not one of Judge Wisdom’s “Jase”
clerks. Judge Wisdom has had approxj-
mately 45 clerks since Matt and I were
there, including the infamous Robert M.
Couch ’78, ’82L. Judge Wisdom, now jn
his 88th year, recently celebrated 36
years of very active service on the U.S.
Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit.

Robert G. Pugh Jr. °76

. .. And Minor Rogers

I noticed in the Fall issue of the
Alumni Magazine a mention of Rennyo;
The Second Founder of Shin Buddhism, the
new book by Ann and Minor Rogers, |
can’t tell you how happy I am that
Minor Rogers has been immortalized in
word.

During my senior year at W&L,
Minor Rogers was my mentor. He was ©
an ordained Christian minister who rec-
ognized the importance of other reli-
gious traditions, Buddhism in particular.
I met Dr. Rogers at a time when I was
questioning the beliefs and practices of
my own Christian religion, He had such
an impact on me that I decided to enroll
in the religion department’s senior the-
sis class as a history major. What I

Calling Dr. Gaines

On the occasion of my 84th birthday
last year, my thoughts turned to Francis
Pendleton Gaines, who had been presi-
dent of Washington and Lee from 1930
ro 1958. | did not think it possible Dr.
Gaines would still be alive, but if he
were, | would certainly like to write him
a letter of appreciation for what he did
for me.

During my four years at W&L, I
received monograms in football and
boxing. | was business manager of the
Calyx, Eminent Archon of the SAE fra-
ternity, and was inducted into ODK my
senior year. However, I did not have the
minimum requirements for admission to
medical school you could usually get in
two ycar’s.

| made an appointment to see Dr.
Gaines and told him I wanted to apply
for medical school because I had decid-
ed to go into medicine. Dr. Gaines
reviewed my record and, much to my
surprise, wrote an excellent letter to
Duke University Medical School where
he had connections with Dr. Davidson.
Dr. Davidson had started the Duke
Medical School and was in the process
of selecting students for the first fresh-
man class. In his letter he told Dr.
Davidson that I was the type person
who set goals and would not stop until I
attained them. Dr. Gaines told him, “He
feels we wanted to have an M.D. degree
and | am sure he will be able to obtain
this.”

Dr. Davidson interviewed me and
told me if I could take a year of German
and a year of organic chemistry before
Oct. 1 of that year when the classes
began, he would give me a chance. He
Showed me a class photograph and told
me it was the class that had begun as a
second-year class and there were several

pictures covered by black spots. He told
me those were the ones that didn’t
make it. “I don’t want to have to put a
black spot over your picture,” he told
me.

I was able to fulfill the requirements,
and began class as scheduled. The first
two years were hard and I struggled. In
all honesty, I had never read a novel
from cover to cover up to that time.
After the first two years, I did well in all
my studies and graduated without any
problems.

Following graduation, I took my sur-
gical training at both Duke and the
Lahey Clinic in Boston. I went into a
general surgery practice with my father
in Lynchburg, Va., for 20 years. Upon
his death, I decided there were no new
frontiers in general surgery at that time,
whereas plastic surgery was making sig-
nificant improvements. I developed a
flaming desire to be a plastic surgeon.

Through a good friend, Dr. Jack
Coleman, who was chief of plastic
surgery at the University of Virginia, I
began a three-month fellowship with a
world-renowned plastic surgeon in
Miami, and I subsequently ran all over
town day and night for 15 years doing
plastic surgery before assuming a full-
time position at the University of Miami
Medical Complex.

‘That was eight years ago. I enjoy
good health and my goal is set on being
productive until I am 100 years of age.
Someone up there has been looking out
for me—sending me to Washington and
Lee and Dr. Gaines—and all that has
followed.

The Campaign for Washington and Lee begins 1994 with $92.2 million in the
bank and an ambitious schedule in the coming months. The largest fund-raising
effort in W&L’s 245-year history is expected to cross the $100 million mark by early
March, according to national campaign chairman Gerry Lenfest ’53.

With 18 months to go toward its targeted comple-
tion date of June 30, 1995, the campaign is approxj-
mately $34.8 million from its goal of $127 million,

° meaning that there’s many a major gift to be realized
before the campaign can be deemed complete. Later
this year, plans will be announced for a student-con-
ducted effort to contact all alumni who have made a
campaign gift that will, in effect, amount to an every-
member canvass of the University’s 18,000-strong
alumni base.

Through the end of December, Washington and
Lee has received $92.2 million toward its $127 million
goal. ‘That total includes gifts from the following:

471 alumni with undergraduate and law degrees;

7,252 alumni with undergraduate degrees only;

1,312 alumni with law degrees only;

1,447 parents of former or current students;

197 corporations and 86 foundations;

And finally, the financial support of the Virginia
Foundation for Independent Colleges.

The area campaign schedule resumes in February
with kickoffs in South Florida (Feb. 9, comprising the
Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach chapters)
and Houston (Feb. 24, which coincides with the Board
of ‘Trustees’ winter meeting there), to be followed by
Jacksonville, Fla., in March and by Charleston, W.Va.,
and Lexington, Ky., in April. Alumni chapters in
Winston-Salem, Greensboro, and Raleigh, N.C., will
be launching their respective campaigns in March as
well.

The reach of the University’s philosophy is more
apparent than ever in the eyes of national vice chait-

Murray’s English department colloquium was the first-ever such reading to include music.

The Jazz Man Cometh

When Albert Murray listens to a
Louis Armstrong solo, what he hears is
more—and more significant—than mere
entertainment, though he its the first to
acknowledge Satchmo’s master show-
manship. Murray, noted author and
reigning sage of American jazz intellec-
tuals, was the English department’s
duPont visiting professor during the fall
term. In addition to teaching a course in
Southern regional literature (encompass-
ing works from the classical Greeks to
William Faulkner, and beyond), Murray
offered an interdepartmental course,
The Blues, using his 1976 Stomping the

Blues as a text. That volume, which is far
more than just history, functioned well
as a jumping-off point for a pan-discipli-
nary examination of how the creative
process works in any art form.

David Wilmington °94, who took
both courses (as well as serving as
Murray’s disc jockey in class sessions),
cites Murray’s ability to unify concepts
from far-flung fields, yielding useful
tools for an intelligent approach to all
creative activity: “He brought ideas
together from philosophy, religion, his-
tory, literature, music, and all the other
arts, so that the sum total far exceeded
the parts, in a way that works on an
intellectual level, and—more practically

——

useful—in ways I can draw on when I
come up against challenges in my own
work.” In June, Wilmington will be-
come W&L’s first music major to grady-
ate with a performance emphasis in sax-
ophone. “What I loved most about
Albert Murray as a teacher,” he says, “jg
that he was talking about how to think,
not what to think.”

Wilmington also functioned as DJ at
Murray’s English department colloqui-
um, which was the first-ever such read-
ing to include musical interludes. These
came from the likes of Armstrong, Duke
Ellington, and Count Basie (whose 1985
biography, Good Morning Blues, Murray
co-authored), and made manifest the
uniquely American rhythms of that
music, the same cadences which inform
Murray’s writings.

What he hears in those works is that
which he builds upon in his own: an
appreciation for the richness of one’s
own heritage, using it to good ends for
extending artistic traditions in construc-
tive new directions. As any creative
being knows, this necessarily involves
overcoming adversity, and Murray’s
work makes a strong case for African
Americans being, to put it mildly, quite
experienced and knowledgeable in this
regard. Even in the deepest, low-down
blues, Murray hears a joyful affirmation
of the triumph of the human spirit over
the human condition.

During his semester at W&L, Murray
also put in some time working on Seven
League Boots, which will complete a trilo-
gy of autobiographically-based novels
begun with 7rain Whistle Guitar (1974)
and The Spyglass Tree (1991). His other
non-fiction works include The Omat-
Americans (1970) and South to a Very Old
Place (1971).

Albert Murray is one of the very few
who can cite so many senior members of
the jazz pantheon as primary sources,
and he stands virtually alone in having
put, in a scholarly fashion, the work of
those masters into the larger perspective
of American culture as a whole. He does
so in ways that swing as much as theif
music did. There is no more erudite an
advocate of jazz as America’s finest cul-
tural contribution to our human race.

Lee Letter Presented
By D.C. Law Firm

\fembers of the Washington (D.C.)
firm of Mason, Fenwick & Lawrence
have presented Washington and Lee
with a letter written by Robert E. Lee to
an old classmate, Judge Charles Mason,
a founding partner of that firm. Partners
B. Parker Livingston Jr., Nathaniel A.
Humphries, and Dale Curtis Hogue Sr.
gave the letter to the University (Hogue
is the father of W&L sophomore Stuart
Hogue).

The letter, written in Lexington and
dated July 6, 1869, is unusual because
I.ee grants the firm the use of his name
as an endorsement. Lee received many
such requests in the post-Civil War
years and refused most of them. But in
this case, he writes, “I cannot refuse an
endorsement to a firm, one of whose
members is my friend and classmate,
Judge Charles Mason.” (Mason and Lee
were classmates at West Point, finishing
first and second, respectively, in the
class of 1829, and there are numerous
references to their academic rivalry in
Douglas Southall Freeman’s biography.)

\lason, Fenwick & Lawrence is now
beginning its 133rd year of practice.
Founded at the start of the Civil War,
the firm enjoys an international reputa-

tion in intellectual property law.

“Choosing a card ts like choosing a law school,” says ace recruiter Bobby Lilly ’93L.

The Admissions Magician

At a time when law school applications are on the decline nationwide (for the third
straight year, in fact), it may take more than magic to attract the best and the bright-
est—but a little hocus-pocus doesn’t exactly hurt, either.

As one of three 1993 law graduates sent on the admissions trail this fall (along with
Kimble Reynolds and Kim Wood), Bobby Lilly traveled the country from mid-
September to early November, attending law forums on six consecutive weekends
where roughly 110 schools were pitching potential applicants from their booths in a
trade show-like atmosphere. If the turnout was small, or when things got dull, Lilly
would get the conversation going with the W&L Card Trick—wherein, to make a
long card trick short, he picks the card an applicant’s been thinking of from a full
deck, turns the card over, and reveals the words “Washington and Lee” written on
the back. Neat trick—but when it comes to W&L, “The school sells itself,” he says.

Lilly’s career as a magician began at age 6, when he used a $10 Christmas gift to
order a magic set from a Sears catalog. He performed a different trick each Friday for
his kindergarten class when his teacher suggested that he put on a show. He quickly
graduated to the ranks of church dinners, women’s clubs, Kiwanis, and the like, and
by the time he was 13 he joined the International Brotherhood of Magicians (“the
other IBM,” he calls it), with his parents driving him to meetings.

Lilly studied psychology, speech communications, and theater arts at the Univer-
sity of Richmond, and he utilized those skills—and others—working with emotionally
disturbed and delinquent teenagers at Elk Hill Farm in Virginia. “Magic was a won-
derful counseling tool,” he says. “Magic tricks have themes that generate discussion,
teach lessons, and make points. Magic is a vehicle or medium for a specific message.”

Sporting a black shirt and a black-and-blue tie adorned with Aladdins, Lilly does
not exactly look like he’s on his way to work in a law office. With his admissions work
behind him, Lilly is looking for hands-on experience in a court service unit. But even
when that time comes, he’ll always find time for his other profession. While perform-
ing at a recent department store opening, Lilly was asked by someone where he
learned how to perform magic. “Three years of law school,” Lilly jokingly replied. To
which someone replied: “That’s the best use I’ve heard of for an attorney in years.”

God s Thumbprint: Lhe aptly Nit knamed Burk x Gara HM]. Va.. ]

In 1936, when Washington and Lee
student Jim Hoge had to choose
between continuing his education and
returning to his family farm, he did what
every good son of Burke’s Garden
would do.

He went back to the Garden.

Seen from the air, it looks just like a
giant's thumbprint, but the 260 people
who live in this valley nestled high in
the mountains of ‘Tazewell County, Va.,
prefer to think of it as God’s ‘Thumb-
print. A recent visit to Jim and Louise
Hoge’s 600-acre farm does little to dis-
pute this assertion. One thing is certain:
Burke’s Garden is a place like no other.

At about 3,000 feet, this 20,000-acre

10

) ) f
L0( Cardeners.

MOF} la

limestone valley is the highest in
Virginia, the coldest, and the only one
surrounded by a single mountain.
Formed millions of years ago from
upthrust rock that eroded below the
more resistant surrounding rock, this
huge topographical bowl has only one
opening, known as the Gap, where the
water drains to the sea. For thousands of
years, American Indians used the valley
as a hunting ground, and in 1745,
explorer James Burke became the first
European to discover the valley as he
followed a wounded elk over the crest of
the mountain. A pile of potato peelings
he discarded was found, a year later, to
have grown into a fine crop, and the

 

land was jokingly named Burke’s
Garden. Later settlers found that
indigenous bluegrass thrived in the cool
temperatures (rarely does it get above
90), making the valley perfect for raising
cattle and sheep.

Hoge grew up in the house his grand-
father built in 1880 out of a quarter-mil
lion bricks—all of them made there on
the farm. Knowing the rollercoastef
nature of the cattle business, his parent
set aside some money for their sons’
education. In 1934, Hoge, by his ow?
admission “a real country boy,” decided
to attend Washington and Lee following
his older brother, Francis, who had grad-
uated from the law school that year.

“Two fellows I knew from Marion,
Va., were going to W&L and I got a lit-
tle lonesome,” he recalls. “So I followed
them up there, just went along, and
when | got there they accepted me. I
missed freshman camp and everything!
| eventually interviewed with Dean
[Robert] Tucker who said, “Well, son,
we'll do the best we can for you,’ and |
was accepted into the pre-law program.”
Rather modestly, he adds with a laugh,
“I chink it must have been because of
the Depression and they needed the
students!”

Hoge joined Pi Kappa Alpha fraterni-
tv and took a room in a boarding house
behind the post office. Despite feeling
sometimes that he was “the only farm
boy in the whole student body,” Hoge
soon settled in. But after little more
than a year, his sister’s pending depar-
ture from Burke’s Garden (his parents
were deceased) called him back to the
family farm. “I could have stayed in
schoo! but that would’ve meant selling
the farm,” he explains. “So I had to quit
school.”

‘Then, as now, land in the Garden is
hard to come by. Back in the 1880s, mil-
lionaire George W. Vanderbilt tried—
unsuccessfully—to acquire a large tract
of land in Burke’s Garden to build his
mansion. “Back then especially, the
only way to get land was to heir it or
marry it,” Hoge explains. Eventually,
the Biltmore House and Gardens came
to rest in Asheville, N.C., Vanderbilt’s
second choice.

in 1938, Hoge married Louise Gree-
ver, a schoolteacher with a degree from
Radford, and settled into the life of a
sheep farmer. Over the years, the Hoges
raised a family and many prize sheep. In
the early 1950s, a coyote terrorized the
Garden for months, killing more than
400 sheep before the “varmint,” as it
became known, was finally killed by a
hired coyote hunter from Arizona.
Afterwards, people came from miles
around to gawk at the carcass, and
Burke’s Garden experienced its first
(and only) traffic jam.

The Hoges, now retired, are both
active in the community as well as dedi-
cated local historians. Louise was instru-
mental in having the valley’s one paved

road named a Virginia By-Way, and Jim
is Known as the unofficial mayor of
Burke’s Garden. “After I retired, I start-
ed digging into the records of all the old
land grants in the Garden,” he says.
“lve dug in and worked backward, for-
ward, and in-between—all the way back
to the original survey. Burke’s Garden
was the first land surveyed in ‘Tazewell
County and some of the fences are still
on the original lines.”

Besides taking up the preservation of
old horse-powered farm machinery (“I
was probably the first one to get rid of
that old stuff, and now I want to pre-
serve it,” he chuckles), Hoge is fighting
to maintain the unique rural nature of
Burke’s Garden. Given the uncertainties
of farming, increasing land prices, and
the influx of urban refugees, the Hoges
worry that the old families will move
away and the large farms will disappear,

with “farmettes” taking their place. A
recent wave of Amish farmers, fleeing
the increasing urbanization of the
Pennsylvania Dutch country, has
already brought change into the Garden.
“Some people worry that they will bring
too many tourists here,” says Hoge, “but
I’m glad they came. They are farmers
first, and they want to keep the land as
it was.”

Looking out the Hoges’ picture win-
dow across the gently rolling farmland

Both an old-tashioned joumalist and community activist, MW, Paxton 49
chronicles Lexinoton’s present wile preserving its past * By Bran Shani

Anyone who has spent any time in a
small town knows about institutions—
the people that give small towns their
flavor and character. To be called an
institution is usually a great compli-
ment, although institutions can be as
diverse as a barber, a police chief, or
even a drunk who finds his customary
place on the courthouse wall. Institu-
tions are there when you need them,
can always be depended on to act in a
clear and consistent way, and when they
are gone they are greatly missed, often
leaving a void that is never truly filled.

Matthew W. Paxton Jr. °49 is just
such an institution, although he would
bristle at that characterization. For 42
years he has served the Lexington and
Rockbridge County area as editor of 7he
News-Gazette, a weekly newspaper his
family has owned in part since the last
century. When he steps down as editor
and publisher in March—allowing his
son, Matthew W. Paxton IV, to take
over total control of the news and print-
ing business that is the News-Gazefte cor-
poration—Paxton will keep a hand in
the business in a small way through
occasional editorial writing. But he plans
to leave behind the news and events
that have shaped his life and the com-

12

munity’s for almost half a century. He’ll
play some golf, work on various literary
projects, and stay involved in local activ-
ities. Still, as a newsman, he admits,
“It’s going to be an adjustment.”

The Paxton roots run deep in the
hard, rocky soil of Rockbridge County,
and their connection with Washington
and Lee runs just as deep. Matt Paxton
was the fourth generation of his family
to attend the University, beginning with
E.F. Paxton in 1846, proceeding through
Judge J.W. Brockenbrough (who invited
General Lee to come to Washington
College), through his father and to him.
His second son, Bill, continued the lega-
cy, graduating in 1980 (he works as as-
sistant director of major gifts for W&L).

Paxton was born and raised in
Lexington. He prepped at the Darling-
ton School before returning home to
Washington and Lee. He lived at home,
pledged SAE, and became immersed in
the life of the University. “It wasn’t
unusual to live at home then,” he says.
“Many local boys lived at home. The
fraternity gave me a jumping-off point.”

After a year in the Navy between his
freshmen and sophomore years, Paxton
came back to W&L. He became active

in the Christian Council and with The
Ring-tum Phi, and joined the Glee Club.
After graduating in 1949, Paxton taught
English for a year at the McCallie
School in Chattanooga. He considered
making teaching his life’s work before
deciding to become a journalist.
Although his family owned one of the
two competing weekly papers and his
father was the editor and his mother the
proofreader, Paxton had never spent a
lot of time at the paper. He enrolled in
Columbia University’s masters program
in journalism and headed off for New
York City. “I just loved New York,”
Paxton says of his days at Columbia. “It
was very exciting. There must have
been five or six daily papers going at
that time and the seminars we had were
taught by newspaper people. Just sitting
at their feet and listening to them talk
about what they did was great. It was
the hub of journalism in those days.”
While Paxton’s classmates were busy
angling for jobs with those New York
dailies, Paxton knew he wanted (0
return to Virginia. Although he doesn’t
recall how, he landed a job as education
reporter for the Lynchburg pape! —
(“The fact that my wife’s uncle was edi- —
tor may have had something to do with

Pisicumcneerss ctl
we

it,” he admits.) He spent a year in
Lynchburg before the call came from
his father to come home and run The
County News.

As with many small newspapers at
the time, Paxton was a one-man news
department. He attended meetings,
wrote the stories, edited copy, shot pho-
tographs, and did just about anything
that needed to be done. The competi-
tion between The County News and The
Lexington Gazette was fierce, and Paxton
worked hard to stay one step ahead.
After 10 years of slugging it out, the two

that touches people’s lives is news for
somebody. I like to get a lot of people in
the paper.”

Getting those people in the paper
sometimes takes the form of stories and
mentions that seem almost anachronistic
compared to the fast-paced world of
contemporary journalism. ‘The commu-
nity news pieces in 7he News-Gaxefte are
just what the name implies—news from
local communities. Written by residents
of the respective communities, the col-
umns are filled mainly with the comings
and goings of the people who live in

"We ate strictly a local newspaper. It it doesnt
happen in Kockbndge County, :t doesnt happen.

newspapers decided to merge. “We
went into a room at the old R.E. Lee
Hotel with a newspaper negotiating guy
from New York and came out as part-
ners,” he recalls. “Both papers went
from not making much money individu-
ally to instant profitability.”

Houston Harlow, a VMI graduate
who owned the other paper, became the
business manager, enabling Paxton to
devote his entire efforts to the news and
editorial end. ‘he arrangement contin-
ued until Harlow’s death in 1972.
Harlow was replaced by Tad Hum-
phreys °44, who stayed on as business
manager until 1986, when Matt Paxton
IV assumed the position. ‘That arrange-
ment has continued to the present.

Ask five journalists what their defini-
tion of news is, and you'll get five differ-
ent answers. For Matt Paxton, though,
the question is very simple. “We are
strictly a local newspaper,” he says with
a hint of pride. “If it doesn’t happen in
Rockbridge County, it doesn’t happen.”

Paxton traces that philosophy back to
his days in New York, when he came
“under the spell” of The New York Times.
“Our objective is to cover anything we
can that happens in this county, no mat-
ter how small or how large. Anything

14

those communities. And while the fact
that Aunt Sadie had her two nephews in
for a long weekend may not be news to
99 percent of the readership, Paxton
says, it is news to Aunt Sadie. “We want
our readers to have share in the owner-
ship of our paper,” he says. “Nothing
promotes that feeling more than seeing
your own name in the paper.”

Sometimes that emphasis on local
news and names comes at the expense
of hard-hitting, investigative stories.
With only so many resources at his dis-
posal, Paxton has constantly and consis-
tently chosen to emphasize the human
aspects of the news. He knows that’s a
criticism of his newspaper.

“Yeah, the old marshmallow guy,
that’s me,” Paxton says. “I know I’m too
soft for some people, but I look at our
role as one of being a reconciling force
in the community. Our role is to get
people to pull together. I’ve never writ-
ten an editorial or a story attacking any-
one and I never will. Reporting the hap-
penings is what’s important to me.”

Doug Harwood ’74, editor of The
Rockbridge Advocate, a monthly news
magazine, thinks the Paxton style is per-
fect for the Lexington and Rockbridge
community. “Mr. Paxton does what he

  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
    
   
  
 
  
     
   
 
    
  
  
 
   
   
  
  
  
  
 
 
  

does very well. It’s a good, solid commy
nity newspaper,” he says.

Although Paxton’s role as editor of
the local newspaper has afforded him
the power to influence decisions, it js if
the role of community activist that he
has made a lasting impact on the small
city of Lexington. Back in the mid-
1960s Paxton was one of a small group
of individuals who started the City’s
efforts in historic preservation. He was q_
charter member of the Historic Lexing.
ton Foundation as well as a charter
member of the Lexington Downtown
Development Association.

The historic preservation activities
began when, because of various reasons,
some of the older buildings in
Lexington were being torn down.
Something had to be done. ;

“The first group associated with the
Historic Lexington Foundation had <
real love and feel for this community,”
Paxton recalls. “They didn’t wan
Lexington to be a museum; they wanted
it to be a genuine business community
There was a strong feeling of affectic
for our community and a strong belie
that we had something special that w
should preserve—something unique.” —

Since those modest beginnings
HL F—of which Paxton has been presi
dent for several terms—has grown to b
a model of a private/public partnershiy
for preservation. The city’s initiatives i
the mid-1970s to bury the utility line
and install brick sidewalks in the do
town was another example, in Paxton
mind, of the commitment to keeping
Lexington “a special place.”

“There are so many things that g
into making Lexington what it is,”
says. Washington and Lee and VMI ce
tainly contribute to the cosmopolité
atmosphere of the place, he says, ame
the emphasis on history and the effort
toward preservation show that the ¢i
takes its heritage very seriously.

“I’ve been fortunate enough to spen
my career in a place that is fun to live if
and has enough going on so that putti
out a newspaper is worthwhile,” $4
Paxton, with his typical understatemen=
“I have enjoyed a totally absorbing,
wonderful career.” ®

y story begins in the fall of
1938, the first day I walked into the
beginning physics class of Dr. R.W.
Dickey at Washington and Lee. I dedi-
cate this story to Dr. Dickey, a man who
taught me that perfection can never be
achieved but should always be sought.

The day after I graduated from W&L
with a B.S. degree in physics, I drove
over to Richmond and enlisted in the
Air Corps. | was assigned to aviation
communications school—basic training
first, school, then my commission. I was
not told when I would be called to
active duty.

I returned home and decided to
enroll at the University of Kentucky and
take whatever courses were available
that might help me after I was called to
duty. After some three months I
received a letter from the Air Corps with
unhappy news: I would not be called for
approximately one year.

Soon afterward, Dr. L.A. Pardue,
head of the theoretical and nuclear
physics sections at the university, sug-
gested that | work toward my master’s
degree and start research on my thesis—
thinking that I could probably finish my
thesis and get my degree in the year
that the Air Corps had so generously
given me. He assigned me a project:
build and calibrate an ultra-sensitive
ionization chamber capable of detecting
Stray radiation.

Dr. Pardue had a way of disappearing
for several days at a time—maybe even
for a week—and rumor had it that he
Was off doing some kind of consulting
Work. Meanwhile, I finished my class-

PS KUVOST OCB
l/r Carée

Briel gay)

 

work and research in about 11 months.
Dr. Pardue seemed pleased with it,
which was gratifying.

I was called to active duty about one
week later, reporting to Goldsboro,
N.C., for basic training, then shipped to
Yale University for my communications
training. While at Yale, approximately
15 of us out of a class of 140 were given
a very comprehensive all-day exam—for
what reason we were never told. When
the results were posted, I was No. 1 on
the list.

Upon completion of the course I was
commissioned at 10 o’clock on a
‘Thursday morning. My orders were cut
for me to go to Florida to night fighters
school, after a two-week leave during
which I was to be married (the invita-
tions having long been mailed). But, at 2
p.m. on the day I was commissioned, |
was on a train headed for Cambridge,
Mass., for an intensive course in electri-
cal engineering at Harvard. ‘There went
my leave and my wedding. (My bride-
to-be eventually came up to Cambridge,
and we were married in Harvard
Chapel.)

 

Upon completing my course at
Harvard, I moved across the river to
MIT where I received an intensive
course in electronics engineering—radar
design, research, and operation. I gradu-
ated at 10 o’clock on a Saturday morn-
ing, and was headed home for that two
weeks’ leave. Instead, six hours later, I
was on a plane headed for Denver—
headquarters of the Second Air Force.
No reason was given—and since by this
time I had a Top Secret clearance, I
knew better than to ask.

While at Denver, I was interviewed
by two civilians who made it a point not
to introduce themselves. After the inter-
view, I was told not to mention it or dis-
cuss it in any way with anyone. There
was really very little about me that they
didn’t already know. I later got to know
them well—Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer
and Dr. James B. Conant.

The following morning I was told to
report to the flight operations officer
with all my gear at 1200 hours. My
orders were sealed and stamped, “Open
upon arrival at destination.” I boarded a
plane and was off to a destination

17

known only by the pilot. Later, we land-
ed in the middle of nowhere—nothing
but flat salt as far as I could see in any
direction—the salt flats of Wendover,
Utah.

A Jeep arrived shortly, and I had
opened my orders. They read, “Report
to commanding officer—1st Ordnance
Squadron—Special Aviation—at Field
Headquarters—Major Charles F. Begg.”
It was there, in his sound-proofed office,
that I was given the whole story.

Begg: “You are here to end the war!”

W.O.: “Aren’t we all?”

Begg: “Yes, but you will end it by
August.”

As he talked, everything fell into
place.

; he First Ordnance Squadron was part

of a completely self-sustaining group,
the 509th Composite Group, consisting
of the 393rd Heavy Bombard-ment
Squadron; 390th Air Service Squadron;
320th ‘Troop Carrier Squad-ron; 603rd
Engineering Squadron; 1027th Material
Squadron; and the 1395th M.P. Group.
We reported to no one other than Curtis
E. LeMay, commanding general of the
U.S. Air Force.

The First Ordnance Squadron-
Special Aviation was the last group to be
assembled. Personnel were carefully
picked from all the various sites in-
volved in the project, including Los
Alamos, Oak Ridge, Hanford, Washing-
ton, the University of Chicago, and
CalTech. We were to tie up all the loose

ends at Wendover, check out all the test
equipment, and ensure that everything
going to Tinian, an island in the South
Pacific 6,000 miles from San Francisco,
was available and adequate. ‘The final
assembly, testing, loading, and delivery
were to be done at and from ‘Tinian.

I made numerous trips to Los Alamos
where most of Oppie’s group worked. I
would leave Wendover and fly to an
airstrip in the middle of the desert. I
would get off the plane and settle down
in a 12’ x 12’ shack and the plane would
leave—not having the slightest idea why
he had flown me there, or where I was
going. Thirty minutes later another
plane would arrive, pick me up, and
take me to Los Alamos. The pilot did
not have the slightest idea where I had
come from and knew better than to ask.
Equipment was handled the same way.

Most components, in fact, were made
in plants around the country, no more
than one per plant. Whenever it was
necessary to visit these plants we wore
civilian clothes. ‘The parts were suppos-

edly being made for some bogus compé
ny and shipped to a warehouse at some
out-of-the-way place. These supplie
had no idea that they were making parts
for the Air Corps. Whenever I made
these trips, I was always accompanied
by someone from the Military Intell-
igence Department or FBI. They made
me turn in my civilian clothes when we
went overseas. This made me very
unhappy. If I wanted to write home
when away from Wendover, my letter
were put in a plain envelope and flow!
back to Wendover to be mailed so that
they would be postmarked Wendovef

about—the chow, the weather, the hea

At Oak Ridge one time I saw Dr
Pardue (for whom I had written my th

shoe made me cross the street to avoid
him for fear that he might write home
and say that he had seen me. There wa
no way I could see him: Wendover an@
Oak Ridge were worlds apart.

We were allowed to go in to Salt
Lake City on a three-day pass from time
to time. Whenever we did, we had to go
down to the orderly room and get our
pass—they would make our reservations
for us—always at the Hotel Utah and in
one of the same group of rooms. We all
assumed they were bugged.

‘There were never any transfers out of
the group, but if there were, they were
to Alaska for the duration because of a
security slip-up and truly it was a slip-
up—security was a way of life. A sign
over the guard house at the one and
only gate to the field read:

WHAT YOU HEAR HERE-

WHAT YOU SEE HERE-

WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE-

LET IT
STAY HERE!

Someone once wrote under it—“or
else.” An hour later, a new sign was up.
One did not joke about security.

When we first went overseas, all mail
Was Censored and then flown back to the
states to be mailed. Later we were
allowed to say we were in the South
Pacific but there was never any mention
of Tinian. Tinian and Wendover, like
oil and water, did not mix.

he 320th ‘Transport Squadron was
making almost daily flights to ‘Tinian—
taking only one of each type of equip-
ment (everything had a back-up), and
only a few personnel from each phase of
the work (no two people with the same
qualifications ever flew on the same
flight) for the purpose of setting up the
labs and getting equipment in place.
Some of us made several trips before the
final big move.

We were quartered in our own area,
ate in our own section in the mess-hall,
and never mentioned our work to each
other outside our work area. High chain-
link fence topped with barbed-wire—
one gate with two guards 24 hours a day
in an isolated part of the field made up
our work area. We were divided into
three assembly groups, working in three
separate buildings with only four of us
allowed to go from one building to the
other. No one in any building knew
what was going on in the other. Only the
coordinators knew the whole picture.

The 393rd Heavy Bombardment
Squadron had just about completed its

training for overseas duty when their
orders were changed and they were sent
to Wendover, Utah. After a few days of
routine orientation they met with
Colonel Tibbets, who told them that
they were there to train for a very spe-
cial job that would probably end the war
much sooner than anyone expected but
that this fact was not to be discussed
again—not even among themselves.
‘They were not told that they were going
to drop an atomic bomb until their final
briefing the night the Eno/a Gay took
off. Both crews were briefed at the same
time. They never even knew such a
bomb existed. I had 15 minutes to tell
them what one was and what they might
expect. The tech personnel of the First
Ordnance Squadron were the only peo-
ple that knew what this whole thing was
all about, and most of them did not
know the whole story. There were some
1,500 Air Force, Navy, and civilian per-
sonnel making up the entire group.

The delivery date was finally set,
which meant increasing pressure and
long hours. All the components from the
three groups were moved to the assem-
bly building, which was located in an
isolated area about a mile from the base.
‘The move was made late at night over a
period of three nights.

The final assembly was not too com-
plicated a process, since each group had
previously assembled all its components
making sure everything went together
perfectly (each part had to fit its match-
ing part, each bolt and nut the right
size). All parts were then numbered,
color coded, then disassembled. These

assemblies did not,
of course, include
the nuclear materi-
al; that was put

     
 

into place only at
the final assembly.
The tricky part
was making sure
that the compo-
nents from each
group matched. ‘The assembly crew was
fairly small, and it was at this point that
I saw my ionization chamber that I had
built at the University of Kentucky sit-
ting there, searching for stray radiation.
Every operation that we did was filmed
and at night after chow, we all watched
the films at least three times looking for
anything that wasn’t quite right.

Everything I have talked about above
were repeated for the second bomb but
at an accelerated schedule because we
had only three days. Loading the bombs
in the planes was relatively simple since
dummy bombs (same size, shape, and
weight) had been loaded many times.
The bombays had been modified to
accept the 9,000-lb. bombs.

The flight to Hiroshima, the primary
target, was relatively smooth and
uneventful—the weather plane ahead
radioed back “target clear.” ‘There was
no flack and no fighter planes. At 35,000
feet their flack was ineffective (not
radar-controlled) and their fighters were
not maneuverable at that altitude. ‘The
main reason that there was no resistance
was that, for two weeks, a B-29 flew
over Hiroshima at exactly the same
time—dropping no bombs—turning and

heading home. The people on the

ground, assuming it was a reconnais-
sance plane, never bothered to look up.

The Enola Gay, piloted by General
Paul Tibbets, had only one problem:
how to get out of there fast. He could
not continue over the target as in a nor-
mal bomb run. General ‘Tibbets asked
Dr. Oppenheimer (“Oppie” by now)
about the best way to get out fast. Oppie
lic a cigarette off the one he was smok-
ing—he was never without a cigarette—
did a few calculations in his head, and
answered, “Turn 169 degrees.” General
Tibbets settled for 170. ‘To turn a B-29
169 degrees at 35,000 feet and not stall
out is no small task. He then practiced it
many times, did it with ease, and the
Enola Gay was on her way home.

The shock wave from the explosion
which was set to take place 1,500 feet in
the air, did not reach the plane for about
50 seconds—all crew members wore
welder’s goggles because they knew the
explosion would be bright. When they
saw the fireball, they could only say,
“My God!” They had just dropped a
bomb on Hiroshima that was equivalent
to 20,000 tons of “‘TN’T—the equivalent
to a full load of bombs from 2,000 B-29’s.

The trip to
Nagasaki was a
little different.
We encountered
bad weather all
the way, only to find our primary target
socked in tight. We circled for about an
hour and then decided to try our see-
ondary target, only to find it under cover
too. We returned to Nagasaki, circled
several times, but were running low on
fuel. We decided to make a radar run,
but on our approach the clouds broke up
and we were able to make a visual run.

Before making our final run, I told
our pilot, Major Charles Sweeney, if we
stalled out on the turn, I would person-
ally throw him out the bombay and he
would have to swim home. “Get back to
your knobs and switches,” he told me,
“and make sure this thing goes off.”

On the final run, he turned The Great
Artiste over to Captain Kermit Behan,
our bombardier. We dropped our bomb
within 20 feet of the center of the targes
made our turn and headed for Okinawa
to refuel before heading home.

The 33 seconds from the “Bombs
away” until the explosion were about
the longest 33 seconds I ever lived
through. I had told Major Sweeney, #
the start of the run, “All systems af
go!” I just prayed they were.

before. The lighting effects begged
description. The whole country was illu-
minated by a searing light with an inten-
sity 10 times that of the midday sun. It
was golden, purple, violet, gray, and
blue. It lighted every crack and crevice
in the nearby mountains with a clarity
and beauty that cannot be described but
must be seen to be believed. Thirty sec-
onds after, the explosion came first, fol-
lowed by the sustained roar which
warned of doomsday. Words are inade-
quate tools for the task of acquainting
those not present with the physical,
mental, and psychological effects. It had
to be witnessed to be realized.

Because of the terrain, the damage of
the Nagasaki bomb was not so wide-
spread as at Hiroshima, but considerably
more devastating. Damage survey later
showed that “Fat Man,” as we called it,
had made the first bomb obsolete.

The Manhattan Project (strictly a
code name) was probably the best-kept
secret in military history. When we were
discharged, we signed all sorts of papers
for security reasons. We were told what
we could say and what we could not say.
We were not allowed to talk at Rotary
clubs, Lions clubs, or Kiwanis clubs, or
discuss any of the details before the
public. We could talk in generalities, I
suppose, but I made up my mind, be-
Cause we were threatened with a fine of
sO much and could be confined for a cer-
tain length of time if we said something
that we shouldn’t say, that the simplest
Course of action was just to say nothing.
So, for close to 50 years, I said nothing.

Now, I have spoken.

n 1946, following the war, Shropshire returned to the University of
Kentucky where he taught physics until 1953. From there he joined the
corporate world, working in industrial research and development and
machine design. He retired in 1985 following a successful career with
Hoover Ball and Bearing.

These days, Shropshire stays very busy running his old Kentucky family
farm, tending to his cattle and his profitable tobacco crop. Shropshire
returned to the 550-acre farm where he grew up in Paris, Ky., following his
wife’s death last
year. “It’s a Ken-
tucky ‘bicenten-
nial farm’ since
it’s been in my
family for more
than 200 years,”
he says.

Before retiring,
Shropshire was
a “windshield
farmer,” com-
muting back

and forth to the farm while a full-time manager oversaw the actual opera-
tion (he has since taken over managing the farm himself). His older son,
Walter, and his family also live on the property, in the large old family
home, while Shropshire resides in a small one-story house in the backyard.
He calls it the work house: “My sisters call it the Cottage in the Yard.”

In addition to farming, he has taken up another old favorite hobby—
designing and building furniture. His house is entirely furnished with
pieces he has made, from breakfronts to bedside tables. He also makes
furniture for his sisters and his two grown sons. “I get a lot of custom
orders from my family,” he says, “and I try to make them all something for
Christmas. I just wander around their houses to see what they need.”

Between his farming and his furniture-making, Shropshire has had plen-
ty of time to reflect on his war years. “After the war, everybody just kind of
went his own way,” he recalls. “Some of the participants went on lecture
tours and sent their royalties to radiation victims in Japan.” He still hears
occasionally from Paul Tibbets, pilot of the Exo/a Gay.

Shropshire views his service during World War II as one of the many
chapters in his life. “If I build a fence, I know it’s built and I put it out of
my mind and go on to the next project,” he explains. “I'll build a piece of
furniture and forget about it until I see it a couple of years later. I take life
one project at a time.”

W&L’S FIRST APPEARANCE IN A ‘BOWL’ GAME SINCE 19533

WAS A LONG, STRANGE, AND UNFORGETTABLE TRIS

By Brian Logue

W&L junior Jake Kim-
ball, a 5°10” wide receiver for
the Generals football team,
has done his fair share of
traveling and has a suitcase
full of horror stories. The
California native, who now
lives in the Philippines with
his parents, recalls flying into
Manila just as nearby Mount
Pinatubo erupted, covering
the air field with ash. He and
his mother spent two nights
in the Manila Airport waiting
for some 2,000 Boy Scouts to
shovel out the runway before
travel could resume.

Anyway, getting to the
Bermuda Bowl in Novem-
ber—a journey that encom-
passed three days, four air-
ports, and some 100 compli-
mentary dinners at a hotel in
D.C.—ranks right up there
with Mount Pinatubo, in
Kimball’s estimation.

Few who made the jour-
ney would dispute him.
When typical Division III
football trips consist of box
lunches at a roadside rest
stop, long bus rides to towns
you've never heard of, and
motels that don’t offer room
service, a player is willing to
do just about anything to
play in a place like Bermuda.
And Washington and Lee’s
football team did just about
everything to get there.

The Generals’ Bermuda
Bowl odyssey aptly began in
a triangle, the Research
Triangle area of North
Carolina, where the team
spent Wednesday night,
Noy. 17, in Durham. Local
TV stations warned of the
impending American Air-
lines flight attendants’ strike,
but everyone was convinced
things would go as planned.
The Generals departed for
the Raleigh-Durham Inter-
National Airport early Thurs-
day morning, paid little heed
to the picketing flight atten-
dants as they arrived, and
Went through the time-con-

suming process of checking
in equipment and baggage.

‘Twenty minutes after its
scheduled 9:10 a.m. depar-
ture time, American Airlines
confirmed what by then
were everyone’s worst suspi-
cions: Flight 1993 to Hamil-
ton, Bermuda, was being
canceled due to those federal
safety regulations that re-
quire a minimum number of
attendants on each flight.
Suddenly those very same
flight attendants that people
had ignored were Public
Enemy No. 1.

‘The team and its travel-
ing party (close to 100 peo-
ple altogether, including
coaches’ wives, players’ par-
ents, and Charles “Murph”
Murray) spent more than six
hours in the’ Raleigh-
Durham airport waiting. And
waiting. And waiting. Some
slept, some played cards, and
some just stared at the
empty runways. “My imme-
diate thought was that we
weren't going to go,” recalls
sophomore wide receiver
James Urban. “We spent
almost a year looking forward
to the trip and it looked like
we weren’t going. There was
so much uncertainty. The
coaches didn’t even know
what was going on.”

Meanwhile, some 800
miles away in Bermuda,
W&L athletic director Mike
Walsh—who had lost his
wallet at the Burger King in
Danville, Va., en route to
Raleigh the day before—got
word of the cancellation from
Bob Robustelli, the trip’s
bearded, potbellied chief or-
ganizer. “He called me up
and asked me if I was sitting
down,” recalls Walsh, who
had just walked in from lin-
ing the field for the game.
“My initial feeling was one
of disappointment and panic,
but Bob assured me that he
and his staff would do every-
thing.”

Indeed, Robustelli and
his crew from Robustelli
World Travel worked the
phones like nobody’s busi-
ness, and once the waiting
was over, the incredible jour-
ney began. W&L’s football
coach of 16 years, Gary Fal-
lon, gathered the traveling
party in the middle of the
airport and delivered the
“good” news: The Generals
were to take a five-hour bus
ride from Raleigh to Wash-
ington, D.C., and spend
Thursday night—at Ameri-
can’s expense—at the May-
flower Hotel in the nation’s
capital. Following a 4:30
wake-up call on Friday
morning, they would then
split up (half the team on
Northwest Airlines, the other
on Delta), fly first to Boston,
and finally continue on to
Bermuda.

Looking back on it later,
the coach was pleased with
the way his team handled
the situation and seemed
truly impressed that nobody
missed the bus from the
hotel in Washington to the
airport after that early wake-
up call. “They may not have
looked good,” Fallon says,
“but they were there.”

A special award should go
to the family of junior wide
receiver Hayne Hodges. His
parents and two sisters live
in Great Falls, Va., just out-
side of Washington, and they
got up very early Thursday
morning to catch a flight to
Raleigh and continue on
with the team. They got to
Raleigh in plenty of time to
wait the full six hours with
the team and then hop into
the bus and head right back
to Washington. And they did
it all with smiles on their
faces.

Send a group of 60 college
guys to Bermuda and the
first thing they want to do is
hit the beach. But Thurs-

day’s mishaps had forced the
Generals to miss practice and
Fallon wanted to make sure
his team was ready to play so
Friday’s practice was on.

To someone who has
never played organized foot-
ball, it’s hard to truly realize
just how miserable practices
can be—especially if you
happen to be in Bermuda.
But Friday’s practice session
was one these players won’t
soon forget.

“It was quite an experi-
ence,” says Urban. “Getting
in a taxicab and then going
to some old elementary
school and practicing on a
soccer field. But the image
that sticks the most was
Drew Thomas kicking the
ball and having all those kids
around.”

A two-time all-conference
honoree, Thomas usually
practices on Wilson Field by
himself while the rest of the
team works out on the upper
practice field. For this prac-
tice in Bermuda, he had a
dozen or so kids leaping to
catch every kick and run the
ball back to him. “The prac-
tice was great,” says Kimball,
“the atmosphere with the
kids all around and then
coming down for autographs
after practice. That was
something we had never
seen.”

One of the observers at
the practice was Kevin—a
12-year-old Bermudan and a
big fan of American football.
Kevin spent the practice
answering everyone's ques-
tions about Bermuda and no
one stumped him, regardless
of the subject. W&L trainer
Tom Jones and equipment
manager Woody Cash asked
Kevin to work at the game
the following day, and he
served as the chief ball boy
for the event.

The first players to speed
away from practice were
senior running back Tom

Mason and sophomore offen-
sive tackle Robert Turner,
W&L’s two representatives
in the debate (see accompany-
ing sidebar). Mason and
Turner had plenty of time
Thursday to go over final
preparations, but precious
few moments to gather their
thoughts before the actual
debate on Friday afternoon.
“Honestly, I wasn’t that
nervous, says Turner.
“Mostly because I didn’t
have any time to get ner-
vous. I had practiced it a lot
and I knew Tommy had
done the same. I didn’t want
to embarrass us, but I didn’t
think I would.”

Ryan with helping the duo
get ready for the debate.
Ryan’s main advice was to
relax and have fun, and
Turner certainly did that.
After Mason had given a
solid argument on why the
Olympics should return to
amateur status, Turner deliv-
ered the best line of the
debate. “I find it ironic that
tomorrow I'll be doing every-
thing in my power to help
Tommy score touchdowns,”
Turner said, “but today,
‘Tommy, you’re wrong.”

A great line, but not
enough; the three-member
judging committee judged
Mason and Georgetown’s

Game. From the specially-
constructed goal posts in the
middle of the end zone that
seemed to reach to the sky to
“the guy of the little shed”
handling the public address
duties for the “match”; from
the legal sale of beer inside
the stadium to the locals
playing a game of flag foot-
ball on the field before the
contest; from the Gombey

ettes’ pre-game routines to
the Bermuda Regimental
Band’s moving rendition of
the “Washington and Lee

biance at Bermuda National
Stadium on Saturday, Nov.
20, was truly something to
remember.

Yet from that carnival
atmosphere came a classic
football game decided in the
closing moments. An estji-
mated crowd of 3,300 (or
roughly 5.5 percent of the
island’s total population) got
spoiled in their first chance
to see American football live.

W&L trailed 10-7 enter-
ing the fourth quarter before
the ground game took over.
The Generals ate up most of
the clock in the final period
marching 86 yards from their
own one-yard line to the
Georgetown 13. W&L was
stopped on a fourth-down
attempt, but got the ball
right back after a George-
town punt. Mason ended the
frustration with an incredible

 

Back to the Old Hotel: The expression on Will Hill’s face (second from right)
pretty much sums up the mood following the team’s heartbreaking 17-14 1085.

39-yard touchdown run
where he dodged countless
defenders and broke several
tackles to give W&L a 14-10
lead with 4:45 to play.

That run also put Mason
over the 1,000-yard mark for
his career and was a special
moment for the offensive
line. “That was the most
incredible run I’ve ever seen
on any level,” says senior tri-
captain and offensive guard
John Surface. “He earned
that run himself.” What
should have been a happy
ending came to a disappoint-
ing close as Georgetown
drove the length of the field
for the first time all day and
scored an on eight-yard
touchdown pass—one of just
four TD passes W&L gave
up all year—to win 17-14.

“It was hard to lose the
last game I'll ever play in,”
Surface says, “but it was a
fun game to play. The atmo-
sphere was incredible. It was
definitely bittersweet.”

A trip like this doesn’t
come along often, which is
why the team’s Bermuda
Bow! memories are likely to
endure. “I’ll remember the
views,” says Turner. “It was
real tough to get ready for
the game. Every time you
looked out the window you
realized you were on this
beautiful island. You almost
had to close the blinds.”

“Everything that could
have gone wrong did,” says
Kimball. “We had all the
trouble getting there, we lost
the game, and it rained on
Our only free day, but we
Managed to have a good
time. In spite of all that hap-
Pened you don’t get a
Chance to hang out with a
froup of guys like this in a
Place like that very often.”

“The travel arrange-
ments,” says Urban. “That’s
not a totally negative thing,

but that’s what I’ll remem-
ber.” @

It’s the last storyboard meeting of 1993, and the staff of 7he
Ring-tum Phi is kicking around ideas for the first newspaper in
January, trying to decide what will still be news in a month's
time. News editor Michelle Brien recounts a meeting with
dean of students David Howison, who was meeting with frater-

nity presidents and pledge leaders in an effort to become pro-
active in preventing hazing: “That,” she says, “is a story.”

“Women’s rush starts in January and we need a male to
cover it,” notes executive editor Fran Kefalas, and other topics
are discussed: renovations to Woods Creek Apartments; stu-
dent report cards; a year-in-review piece; how the Ca/yx did
with its photo drive. And then there’s this person known as
Pantyhose Man, who came around last year before the holidays
seeking out ladies’ pantyhose for a personal project. Seems he’s
been back, only this time he’s asking for socks. “We could do a
preview of the Founders’ Day speaker,” Kefalas says, but the
talk quickly returns to Pantyhose Man: “It’s a pretty dead story
now,” someone says. “And it’ll be deader in January,” a second
person adds.

“You never know,” Kefalas says. “He could be needing
socks over Christmas.”

This, in case you’ve forgotten, /s student journalism.

For many years, The Ring-tum Phi was the only game in town
when it came to reporting the news and goings-on of the
University. Even when there was a second staff producing a
second student newspaper, it was called—what else?—The
Ring-tum Phi. But that was well before the invention and prolif-
eration of desktop publishing, which means, in effect, that a
student could produce a newspaper or magazine in the comfort
of his or her dorm room.

But that alone wouldn’t account for the emergence of first
the Spectator, and more recently, the 77dent. Both are student-
run publications; both are ostensibly published by something
known as the Campus Reporting Committee, and both share
the same office space. Beyond that, there is little in common
between the two but one thing: Both publications were
launched out of a sense of frustration over the PAz.

ng editor
Size.

The most dramatic evidence of that displeasure came in aq
vote by the student-run Executive Committee during its bud-
get hearings in October. The Ring-tum Phi, “Vhe Student Voice
of Washington and Lee” since 1897, was allocated $3,848.96
for the 1993-94 year. The 77ident, which was founded last April
and bills itself as “A Weekly Newspaper at Washington and
Lee University,” received $7,105. “I tried to explain to the EC
that we were not the old P47,” says Fran Kefalas. “The first
reaction is, we’ve put out a good newspaper this year—what’s
wrong with us?”

Kefalas, a senior journalism major from Whitestone, N.Y.,
started with the P#i as a reporter her sophomore year and
became a features editor one week when the paper “desper-
ately” needed one. She was elected editor last winter by a vote
of the student-run Publications Board (which includes editors
of the Phi, the Calyx, Ariel, the Journal of Science, and the
Journal of Politics). Perhaps more significantly, she is the only
senior-level carry-over from last year’s P#i, a publication that
found critics on all sides.

She took the editorial reins last April, two weeks after an
April Fool’s issue that, with its scatological and sexually explic-
it attempts at humor, succeeded in offending nearly every-
body. “It was just one giant childish paper,” admits Kefalas,
who calls the parody edition “a bad judgment” and “the culmi-
nation of a bad year.” (The issue was originally intended to be
“like a Hollywood glamour magazine,” she says, reflecting the
theme of Fancy Dress and the presence of Foreign Student on
campus, “but that was not the basis of the editorial content. ) ;

Changing perceptions was difficult, however, and the Phi
weathered a tough spring term. But now, Kefalas says, “We
have a good base of reporters writing for us, and we haven't
had any problems with ads this year. People are getting 4 much
better Phi.” The Phi shifted its publication day from Thursday
to Friday, added a comics page, and expanded coverage of a
rounding schools, such as VMI and the Southern Virginia
College for Women.

But the biggest change is that the paper is free again.
Phi prints anywhere from 2,300 papers on a typical weeken

(The
d to

ae

as many as 3,200 for a “really big weekend” such as Home-
coming.) During the previous year’s budget hearings, the
Executive Committee decided it was only going to pay for stu-
dent subscriptions, and when the University declined to pick
up the cab for professors, anyone who wasn’t a student who
wanted co read a Pfr had to shell out a quarter for the privilege.
Things got so bad, says managing editor Nancy Pavlovic °94,
chat “professors were waiting for students to finish a PAi”
rather than buy one themselves—although “I did see a profes-
sor take one and put 25 pennies in.”

But with a staff of mostly newcomers, things have quickly
curned around. “A lot of these people didn’t know anything
about the way the PA worked, but they also didn’t know any-
thing about how the computer worked,” says Kefalas. “We all
came together. We all wanted the same basic thing: to make
the PAi work again.”

By at least one reader’s reckoning, it’s working. “The Pz
says Marc Kreppel °94, editor of

’

has improved a lot this year,’
the Washington and Lee Spectator (which called itself “An
Independent Journal of W&L Life and Culture” as recently as
last February). Taking the PAs to task for its April Fool’s issue
last year, the Spectator wrote: “Had the Phi been a fraternity
that decorated a party with the pages of this offensive issue,
the Hill would have required them to hire a sensitivity trainer
for sexual re-education.”

While the right-minded Spectator has built a sizable campus
readership of fans and foes alike since its introduction nearly
five years ago, many alumni had never heard of the magazine
until last spring, when nearly 17,000 copies were mailed out to
the entire alumni body—probably the largest print run of a stu-
dent publication in W&L history. The Spectator mailing
included a solicitation letter from T. Kenneth Cribb Jr. °70,
who is a member of the Spectator’s alumni advisory board and
president of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, a non-profit
educational organization that promotes the “importance of a
traditional liberal arts education rooted in the Western her-

itage.” ‘he mailing generated contributions from more than

 

200 alumni and, Kreppel adds, “One thing we were successful
in last spring is getting some of the alumni interested in their
alma mater again.”

(Cribb, a former domestic policy adviser to President
Reagan, is also publisher of Campus, a nationally distributed
student-run newspaper that focuses on “current abuses and
potential reforms in higher education.” Former Spectator senior
editor Marc Short ’92 says of Cribb, “He’s a wonderful alum-
nus who’s very interested in what’s happening at W&L.”)

Having come out with both guns blazing in years past, the
Spectator has adopted a somewhat muted tone of late, publish-
ing only one issue during fall term. “This year there hasn’t
been any big controversy—not that we thrive on controversy,”
Kreppel says with a laugh. A primary goal in the coming year
will be to engage the alumni in the selection process for a suc-
cessor to President Wilson, Kreppel says, although he’s quick
to note, “I think the students enjoy the magazine, and we
write primarily for the students.”

The Spectator was hatched out of conversations about the
Phi between then-sophomores Paul Lagarde and Ray Welder,
1991 graduates of W&L. “We felt like there was not a lot of
good investigative journalism going on and that the P47 was
very one-sided in its views,” recalls Lagarde, now a third-year
law student at Louisiana State University. “We thought,
maybe we can just write for 7he Ring-tum Phi, but then we said,
if we were able to start something up with a specific idea in
mind then it could continue after we left and provide a forum
for other students to do that sort of thing.”

Lagarde and Welder approached the student-run Publi-
cations Board for a start-up grant—“We tried to persuade
them of our good intentions,” Lagarde says, “that it was not a
flash in the pan”—but nothing came of it, and eventually they
went before the Executive Committee, where the motion was
debated and ultimately tabled. While not being able to- get
student funding was a big disappointment at the time,
Lagarde believes that independence has served the Spectator
well in the long run: “There are various rules you have to fol-
low as a member of the Publications Board.”

Putting out the first issue of the Spectator—setting up an
office in the spare room in Lagarde’s apartment above the
College Town Shop, using The Ring-tum Phi’s laser printer and
cutting board after the staff had called it a night, sometimes
not until 2 in the morning—was no small task. “None of us had
any idea what we were doing,” Lagarde recalls. “We sort of fig-
ured it out and got that first issue out.”

Sporting clip art of the University’s namesakes and a cover
blurb that asked, “Is This The Same Place You Left?”, 2,000
copies of the Washington and Lee Spectator appeared on campus
on Reunion Weekend in May 1989. The 12-page, no-ads, pub-
lication cost a little more than $700, and Welder had to cut a
personal check of about $200 to pay the bill, Lagarde recalls.
“We were able to raise enough money over the summer to get
it going again,” he adds, and the Spectator published five issues
in the 1989-90 school year, and seven issues in 1990-91.

Even if the Spectator wasn’t cutting-edge journalism, it was
decidedly the leader of a new pack of student publications,
including a Christian magazine, Common Ground, and The
Traveller, sort of a liberal counterpart to the Spectator. “We
always felt that if we did the Spectator that something like The
Traveller would show up,” says Lagarde, who gave founding
editor Matt Jackson °94 advice and technical assistance during
the start-up stages of his publication, assistance he acknowl-
edged in the first issue.

Cameron Humphries ’93 came to Washington and Lee with
a pile of computer equipment in the fall of 1989, just months
after the Spectator had made its first appearance on campus.
“When I came to W&L I had some vague notion of starting a
small publication of my own and calling it Genera/ Opinion,” he
recalls. Almost immediately, he began writing op-ed pieces for
the Pfi, with titles such as “Atheism: our new religion?” and
“Abortion: The Final Solution?” “Those got somewhat of a
response on campus,” he says.

Soon after, he met Paul Lagarde, and they hit it off pretty
well: Humphries talked about his columns, while Lagarde
talked about the Spectator. “I hadn’t been very impressed with
it at all—from a layout or an editorial point of view,”
Humphries confesses, but Lagarde invited him to apply his
desktop-publishing know-how to the publication, and the
Spectator soon became, as Humphries puts it, “the thing that
overwhelmed and dominated my four years at W&L.”

Humphries took over the editorial reins almost a year to the
day of that first meeting, and in his eyes, the publication found
its niche in the fall of 1991. Its mission, he says, was “not to try
and be National Review, but to try and be an investigative mag-
azine for W&L. We definitely have a perspective or a founda-
tion from which we preach and look at an issue.”

The “absolute low point of the magazine,” he says, was an
investigative piece on affirmative action hiring that he wrote as
a freshman that quoted the late journalism professor Clark
Mollenhoff as saying that a colleague “had been hired strictly
on the basis that she was a woman.” Only the Spectator was
dead wrong. “It was a huge gaffe,” Humphries says, and worse
still, it came at a time when “we had just started developing

30

 

keer the administration

honest, says one former editor
of the Spectator’s mission.

credibility.” The talk on campus, he says, was that “the
Spectator will never be anything more than an extreme, right-
wing rag. ‘That was the one lick that Woke me up.”

Since then, the Spectator has devoted much investigative
energy to exposing shortcomings in the now-defunct Confi-
dential Review Committee, problems that it perceives with
Fraternity Renaissance, and administrative actions that smack
of political correctness in its eyes. If there is a long-term mis-
sion for the publication, “I hope it’s to keep the administration
honest,” says Marc Short. “Ray and Paul and myself and
Cameron and Marc Kreppel have always been dedicated to the
Spectator because we’re dedicated to the traditions of the
University,” he explains. “I loved my four years at WkL—
they were the best years of my life—and I wanted to be able to
hold on to a piece of the University. It should be there for the
generations that follow.”

An often-heard criticism that the Spectator represents 4
fringe element of the student body rings “hollow,” in Short’s
opinion. The Spectator’s senior-level editorial staff, he points
out, has included fraternity presidents, IFC president, Contact
chairman, Panhellenic chairwoman, Phi Beta Kappas,
University Scholars, All-American athletes and law students—
diversity of perspective “the other publications have not see?
in the last five years.”

With grant money from an organization known as che
Madison Center for Educational Affairs to expand its subsermp-
tion base, the Spectator paid an outside firm “many thousands
of dollars,” Humphries says, to key in all alumni names and
addresses for a mass mailing of the Spectator which took place
early last summer. A planned “best-of” collection of articles

 

The 3S} tator exists “for Wé&L,”
says mer editor Cameron Hum-
phris “It’s not to hurt WéL.”

was scrapped for an overview of President Wilson’s first decade
in office, and the task fell to Humphries to produce the story in
under a week’s time (he also contributed an essay in the back
of the book). “Looking back on that article, it was very long” —
roughly 8,000 words—“and probably very tedious and boring.”

But now, he says, “I don’t think that people could give us
the same indictments that they gave us three years ago, that we
weren't thorough. I am proud of that issue.” Of everything,
that is, but the typographical errors that have been part and
parcel of the Spectator since its birth. “The typos that issue
were terrible,” he admits, the result of copy-editing at 4 a.m. “I
think it’s kind of good that people now dwell on the typos—
that people don’t dismiss us now as some tabloid rag.”

With a staff and student body that has never known a
Washington and Lee without a Spectator, he says, “the tempta-
tion for taking it for granted now is at an all-time high. “All
those freshmen never saw what W&L was like without the
Spectator seven times a year. The impetus is not there for them
to sacrifice Friday and Saturday nights several times a year.
They're not journalists; most of the people are not doing this
because they love journalism.”

If there’s one thing that Cameron Humphries wants the
alumni body of Washington and Lee to know about the
Spectator, it is this: If the Campus Reporting Committee goes
bankrupt or otherwise ceases to exist, any Money In its account
Will be donated to the University’s general scholarship fund.
“The Spectator is for W&L,” he explains. “It’s not to hurt
W&L.”

The Campus Reporting Committee was founded not only
© protect the Spectator from bankruptcy, but so that the

Spectator could have other functions to raise money. “We had
all these mechanisms set up and we never used them,”
Humphries says. “Selling T-shirts at W&L is a tough way to
raise money.” But the organization allowed the Spectator the
opportunity to foster a sister publication such as the 77ident—
even if it bore little family resemblance. “There was definitely
a campus perception that the P47 had deteriorated—that it was
attacking the sensibilities of an overwhelming majority of the
University,” Humphries says. ‘Tension in the ranks had caused
several of the most talented members of that paper to leave the
publication, and Humphries saw an opportunity.

“It had always been a vision of mine and the founders and
Marc Kreppel to report straight news; something we could
never do with the Spectator,” Humphries says. With the con-
sent of editor Marc Kreppel—who would be sharing equip-
ment and office space with the new publication—Humphries
contacted Greg Patterson and Leigh Allen with his idea.
“They were very excited and apprehensive about it,” he
recalls, and with good reason: “If it were perceived as a
Spectrident, it would be dead—and it would make the Spectator
look bad.”

Of course, that turned out not to be the case. “It took a lot
of negotiations to convince other people to come on, that I
meant what I said, that I wasn’t going to backstab them and
that it wasn’t a trap. Once the organization was in place, he
says, “We cut ’em loose and let go. They were turning a profit
much more quickly than we anticipated.”

Playing a small part in watching the 777dent develop was
very gratifying for Humphries, now an administrative assistant
to Morton Kondracke (where, ironically, his duties include
proofreading as a copy editor) for the publication Ro// Ca// in
Washington, D.C. “The Spectator sometimes gets a bad rap,”
he says. Alluding to past criticisms by certain members of the
faculty, he adds, “I don’t think the Spectator is a racist, sexist
and offensively conservative publication. I think we [have]
offended the sensibilities of the feminist race-conscious peo-
ple. There is a difference between offending the sensibilities
of the hyper-racist or sex-conscious and being racist or sexist.”

For executive editors Leigh Allen °94 of Jackson, Miss., and
Greg Patterson ’94 of Dover, Del., Humphries’ offer represent-
ed a chance to produce the paper they might have had they
been named editors of the P/i, which had been a goal for both
since coming to W&L. The two left the PAéi early last year—
both had been news editors—over irreconcilable differences
with “two editors who were leading the PA/ in a direction that
we did not think was consistent with this university,” Allen
says. “The one thing the P#i had going for it was everybody
read it—it was a monopoly. Yet the editors systematically went
about reducing the number of people who were interested in
the paper and the number of people who could actually get
their hands on the paper.”

But the circulation brouhaha only overshadowed serious
morale problems among the staff. “They wanted to run The
Ring-tum Phi \ike The Washington Post,” Patterson says. “They
wanted to be a professional level, professional-looking, profes-

31

sional-acting paper.” ‘To which Allen adds: “We believe there’s
a difference between college journalism and journalism for
profit.”

After being passed over for the PAi editorship in favor of
Kefalas last winter, the two had planned to resume writing for
the new P#i regime when Humphries approached them with
an all-but indecent proposal. “Cameron basically said, “This
school needs another paper; you two are capable of producing
another paper; and I have the equipment if you want to use
it,” ” Allen recalls. “He planted the seed. That, unfortunately,
was a week before exams.”

Planning for the yet-untitled paper began almost immedi-
ately. There were two things, Allen says, they couldn’t have
done the 7rident without: “One was an agreement with
Cameron that the Campus Reporting Committee would have
absolutely no editorial control over the newspaper whatsoever
and would not even make offhand, snide comments about the
editorial content.” ‘The second was a staff: “We sat down and
said, OK, we have to have these six people to make up the core
plus six more people to make up the core of the editorial
board. We picked out the six that we thought were the best
journalists at W&L, and they all worked for the P47 at the
time—and we asked them to come to our paper. Every one of
them accepted.”

In the weeks prior to publication, in fact, people were
“stampeding” Allen and Patterson offering to write for the
paper—“good, talented journalists,” Allen says, “who had
never written for the P47.” On the business end, ex-P/7 manag-
ing editor Josh Manning °93 offered his services, soliciting bids
to print the paper as well as setting up ad rates and rates cards
and selling virtually all the paper’s advertising last spring.

That left Patterson and Allen to concentrate on the editorial
content of the 771dent. “Interesting. Vhat’s the comment we get
most: ‘This is a really interesting paper,’ ” Allen says. “We
don’t cover every meeting and every speech and every little
thing that happens on the W&L campus but we cover the top
three or four or five,” Patterson adds. “And then we do stories
that are much more featurey.”

“We have, by design, two news stories and one feature story
on the front page,” Allen explains. “And that feature story 1s
always light and fun and interesting and it shows some bizarre
side of student life.” That slice-of-life feature has included
girls talking about bathrooms on campus (“Lessons from a
senior: Aim for the toilet”), the new popularity of tattoos
Tattoos not just for

“r

among students—even W&L students (
Hells Angels anymore”), and the behind-the-scenes prepara-
tions for Parents’ Weekend (“It’s Wednesday. Have you
cleaned up yet?”). A section inside the paper, named
Distractions, alerts students to concert goings-on as far away as
Baltimore and Norfolk. It also dutifully reported, in a fresh-
man-oriented guide to the lexicon of Lexington, “According to
rumor, B.V. has one of the highest incest rates in the world.”
That advance edition of the 77dent, mailed out last August
to incoming freshmen, generated some 100 subscriptions from
parents at $30 a pop (which is $4 more than a one-year out-of-
state subscription to the News-Gazette) and some much-needed

32

—

income for the 77ident, which published 14 papers before
receiving any student funding. Which begs the question: Will
the University continue to support two student weeklies?

a ae the pune an will have to
wrestle with later this year, but for now, the papers
to stand up on their own merits. “The Pi has done « fa
able turnaround this year—with advertising and with news,”
observes former PAi and Trident staffer Josh Manning. “Fran
Kefalas has done an amazing job resurrecting a paper that was
seriously damaged. I think the 777dent has stayed more or less
unchanged since last spring, and I think it should have grown
some.

That said, he adds, “Both the PAéi and the Trident will be
able to continue at this point.” As for the long-term viability of
two papers? “I can’t say.”

The 7rdent’s founding editors believe the mechanisms are
in place for their upstart weekly to survive their graduation.
“We know what kind of paper we want—we’ve grown into our
niche,” Patterson says. “You kind of have the PAéz representing
W&L news, and the 77dent representing W&L life.” As for
the P#i, Allen adds: “Fran has raised a fine staff from nothing—
that’s to her credit, and that’s to W&L’s credit. They publish
every week, and they’re good journalists over there.”

“There was probably some tension spring term,” Fran
Kefalas admits, “but as it turned out, especially this year, we’re
doing a lot of different stories. ‘There’s a place for both, I think.
Sometimes we hear comments like, ‘You guys are too serious.
You're trying to be to much like the Post.’ But we’re supposed to
report the news.”

(As for the Spectator, survival seems likely—as long as the
financial support exists, as well as the students to staff it. “I
think it provides a forum for concerned students who are inter-
ested in preserving the history and traditions of the school in
times of change,” says Paul Lagarde. “Any time students are
interested in this sort of thing, the Spectator will be there.”)

,

The most visible confrontation between the PAi and the
Trident was arranged by dean of students David Howison (a
contributor to both papers) on the Lee-Jackson lawn last
September. “Dean Howison had these bocci tournaments, like
the dorm counselors vs. RAs, and the Trident vs. the Phi,”
Kefalas explains. Heckling was encouraged, and the attacks
became “a little personal” at times, she says, but the out
manned Pi staff, eyes bleary from putting out the paper the
previous night, won the contest by a score of 18 to negative-
1—“the largest margin of victory in the entire tournament.”

Leigh Allen shakes his head. “Tom Hespos [an editor and
columnist for the P4/] is an exceptional bocci player,” he says:
“We weren’t on our best bocci game that day, but I'll guaran-
tee you that we had more fun.”

The victory was trumpeted in the P47 in a small ad that read,
“18 to -I—’Nuff said,” and the contest continues to be a great
joke in the Pdi offices, according to Kefalas: “Our sports editor
made up these signs that said, ‘Catch the Fever: The Ring-tum
Phi. Journalism. Integrity. Bocci.’

“We're like, Oh, cool. We should get T-shirts.” @

He is 88 now, but the twinkle is still

Nothing delighted Judge John Minor
Wisdom °25 more about receiving the
Presidential Medal of Freedom in
December than President Clinton’s not-
ing that he was the only one of the five
honorees “who was once a member of
the Republican National Committee.”

What Clinton also said at the emo-
tion-packed White House ceremony was
that Judge Wisdom and his colleagues
on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals did
the whole nation and especially the
South a signal service by the courage
with which they carried out the civil
rights revolution from the 1950s through
the 1970s, when so many of the elected
officials in the region were dragging
their feet.

Judge Wisdom and the other Eisen-
hower appointees to the 5th Circuit—
covering Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi, and ‘Texas—had
the fearful responsibility of enforcing
the historic Supreme Court school
desegregation decision and the later
judicial and legislative actions opening
the polling place, the jury box, and pub-
lic accommodations to blacks.

Wisdom and his colleagues on the
bench were deeply imbued in the tradi-
tions of the Old South; as Clinton noted,
Wisdom’s father marched in the funeral
Procession of Robert E. Lee. They
understood why their region fiercely
resisted change. But instead of taking a
Narrow and crabbed view of their duties,
the judges of the 5th Circuit used all of
their authority—and, critics said, even
appropriated power—to move the South
through and beyond that awesome tran-
Sition to what they clearly saw as its
bright destiny.

Wisdom for the Ages

A Medal of Freedom for Judge Minor Wisdom ‘25

Clinton was giving the judgment of
his own generation that benefited from
their courage when he said, “I don’t
think the South could have made it
through those trying times without lead-
ers like Judge Wisdom.”

Veteran journalist Jack Bass has told
the story of these judges in his 1981
book, Un/ikely Heroes, recounting the
personal abuse, the threats, and the vili-
fication their neighbors poured down on
them and their families.

But the man who was sipping a pre-
dinner cocktail with his wife and daugh-
ter and a few invited guests a couple
days after receiving his medal was any-
thing but a self-appointed martyr. His
knees are stiff but his mind is supple,
and, though officially retired to “senior”
status, he carries his share of the work-
load of the court on which he has sat for
36 years.

As he flipped through his store of
anecdotes—from the 1952 Republican
convention to December’s White House
ceremony, spinning out the yarns in his
rich New Orleans accent and pumping
his visitors for current political gossip—
Judge Wisdom was a man awash in the
pleasures of life.

There is an irony to his career. Before
he and his friend Elbert P. Tuttle of
Atlanta were named judges on the 5th
Circuit, they forced open the door to
today’s two-party South. They and a
handful of others led the Eisenhower
forces that in 1952 seized control of the
Dixie GOP organization from the “regu-
lars” (supporting Robert Taft), who had
deliberately stifled Republican growth
in order to keep personal control of any
federal patronage that might come to
their states from a Republican presi-
dent.

Wisdom was on the bench when
Barry Goldwater and later Richard
Nixon established their own version of a
Republican “Southern strategy,”
appealing directly or by coded messages
to the very Southerners most aggrieved
by the desegregation policies those
Eisenhower judges were enforcing.

 

trying times as

lppeals.

Wisdom roars with laughter, untaint-
ed by any show of bitterness, when he
recalls how John N. Mitchell, Nixon’s
attorney general, dismissed a 1969 sug-
gestion that Wisdom belonged on the
Supreme Court by saying, “He’s a
damned left-winger. He’d be as bad as
Earl Warren.”

‘Though officially out of politics, the
judge cannot conceal his interest in see-
ing the kind of Republicanism that
attracted him to Eisenhower restored to
the White House. After assuring himself
that Clinton would not take offense,
Wisdom invited Alexander, the former
‘Tennessee governor and education sec-
retary, who is planning to seek the 1996
Republican presidential nomination, to
the Medal of Freedom ceremony.

Alexander clerked for Wisdom after
finishing law school, and the judge and
his wife, Bonnie, glow when they talk of
the young man who supplemented his
meager pay by playing honky-tonk
piano on Saturday nights at My Father’s
Moustache on Bourbon Street, then got
up on Sunday mornings to teach
Presbyterian Sunday school.

When President Clinton gave Judge
Wisdom permission to invite a prospec-
tive 1996 opponent to the ceremony, he
gave him a gift almost as much appreci-
ated as the Medal of Freedom itself.

For the Washington and Lee ath-
letic teams, the fall season provided
the usual highlights, some lowlights,

some record-breaking performances,

and some pleasant surprises.
Sophomore Josephine Schaeffer ran
into All-American honors for a sec-
ond straight year; Tom Mason ran
into the football record books; the
water polo team won its second

straight Eastern title; and the volley-

ball team surprised everyone with a
15-win season.

The Generals endured a season of
frustration, losing six games by a touch-
down or less—four of them after leading
in the final period—to finish 2-8. Even

Mason broke three rushing records
against Bridgewater. Mason ran for 230
yards and five touchdowns while scoring
32 points—all school records—in the 41.
16 win. Mason’s dream season ended
with a 191-yard, two-touchdown perfor-
mance in the Bermuda Bowl (see page
16) to push him over the 1,000-yard
mark for the season. He finished with
1,004 yards on the season and finished
his brief career as a running back with
1,522 yards, sixth on the all-time list.

W&L also got big games from senior
fullback Wilson Moore, who ran for 115
yards and two touchdowns in a 34-0 win
over Catholic. W&L’s defense scored
two touchdowns at Sewanee on fumble
returns by Rich Achee and Jon Wagner.

On defense, sophomore Robert Hull
put together one of the best seasons in
recent history. He led the team in tack-
les (111), sacks (10), tackles for loss (8),
forced fumbles (5), fumble recoveries
(5), and blocked kicks (2). He was one
of two Generals to make first team All-
ODAC, alongside senior offensive line-
man John Surface.

Four W&L players were named sec-
ond team All-ODAC, including sopho-
more offensive lineman Robert Turner
and kicker Drew Thomas; and junior
nose guard Jason Chartrand and safety
Marc Newman.

Women’s Cross Country

For the second straight year, sopho-
more Josephine Schaeffer earned All-
American honors, finishing eighth at the
NCAA Championships, improving on
last year’s 12th-place finish.

Schaeffer won nine of 10 races on the
season and posted one of the best times
in the nation when she won the
South/Southeast Regional at Methodist.
Schaeffer broke a course record for the
seventh time on the season with het
school-record time of 16:46. Among her
wins were the Old Dominion Athlete
Conference title and the Division II]
South/Southeast title.

Joining Schaeffer at the NCAA
Championships was sophomore Amy
Mears, marking the first time that two

W&L runners had run in the NCAA
Championship meet. Mears finished
fourth at the South/Southeast regional to
earn the trip to Grinnell, lowa, for the
meet. She was consistently W&L’s sec-
ond runner.

W&L also got All-ODAC seasons
from juniors Kim Herring and Sue
Deutsch. Herring earned All-ODAC
honors for the third time, a first for a
W&L runner, and Deutsch finished in
the top seven at the ODAC for the first
time, giving W&L four All-ODAC run-
ners including Schaeffer and Mears.

Men's Cross Country

The men’s cross country team bat-
tled its opponents, its own inexperience,
and a rash of injuries to a number of run-
ners. Despite the injuries, the Generals
put together a solid season using a line-
up almost entirely of freshmen and
sophomores.

Led by the consistency of sophomore
Tom Fink, W&L finished sixth at the
Lebanon Valley Invitational and had
third-place finishes at the ODAC
Championship, the Virginia State
Championship, and the Christopher
Newport Invitational.

W&L got strong showings on the
season from sophomores Brad Paye and
Jeff Zeiger. Paye was an all-state runner
and finished in 27:12, W&L’s top time
on the season. Zeiger was W&L’s top
ODAC finisher.

Two freshmen also had solid seasons.
Alvin ‘Vownley finished in the top three
for the Generals five times and finished
in 28:11 at Christopher Newport. Sandy
Hooper overcame foot problems and
was W&L’s top finisher at the NCAA
Division III South/Southeast regional.

Men’s Soccer

W&L’s young soccer team made a
mid-season run that it couldn’t sustain,
Winning five of eight games before fin-
ishing the season with a 5-13 record.

That eight-game run included over-
time wins over Dickinson (3-2) and
Guilford (1-0) and a 3-1 win over ODAC
rival Hampden-Sydney. Eventual
NCAA Division III quarterfinalist
Roanoke beat W&L 1-0 on a first-half
Penalty kick.

Mainstays for the Generals were
junior Alan Christensen, senior Dan
Rhodes, and sophomore Shag Drewry.
Despite missing several games with a
knee injury, Christensen was named
first team All-ODAC, W&L’s only rep-
resentative on the team, as a defender.
Rhodes finished his career with 16 goals,
while Drewry led the team in scoring
with seven goals and three assists.

Women’s Soccer

‘The women’s soccer team enjoyed
one of the best turnarounds in recent
years at W&L. The Generals finished
the year 9-7-1 after going 5-11 last year

and contended for the ODAC regular
season title.

W&L was unbeaten and untied in
the league before tying arch-rival
Roanoke 0-0 on Oct. 13. Freshman
goalie Beth Mozena made 15 saves to
preserve the tie. W&L was still in con-
tention for the regular season title but
was shut out twice in the final week. In
the ODAC Tournament, the Generals
earned a rematch with Roanoke follow-
ing a 2-0 win over Guilford, but
Roanoke prevailed 4-1 to end W&L’s
season.

Freshman Michelle Bauman’s six
goals and one assist led a balanced
attack for W&L, followed by seniors
Kate Stimeling (five goals and two

assists) and Corinda Hankins (five goals
and one assist) The team set a school!
record with 36 goals. Mozena made 141
saves and had eight shutouts, just one

_ shy of the school record.

Three Generals earned second-team
All-ODAC honors: Angie Carrington,
Hankins, and Aspen Yawars. Hankins
finished her career second on W&L’s
scoring list and was also named third
team All-South and honorable mention
all-state. Carrington wrapped her career
tied for third on the scoring list.

Volleyball

Like the women’s soccer team, the

 

Junior Alan Christensen earned first-team All-ODAC honors for the men’s soccer team.

volleyball team had a pleasantly surpris-
ing season. W&L won 15 matches on
the season to better last year’s mark of
13 and finished the season with six
ODAC wins, all despite losing its top
three players from last year.

Senior co-captain Tara Burns led the
way with her stable play, guiding the
Generals to a school-record six-match
win streak toward the end of the season
for first year coach ‘Terri Dadio. Burns
led the team in kills with 150 and was
named second team All-ODAC.

W&L also set two individual records.
Sophomore setter Cheryl Taurassi
dished out 526 assists, besting Lisa Jay’s
mark. Freshman Virginia Yoerg shat-
tered the school blocking record with 91

35

blocks, including 67 solo. Yoerg was also
second on the team in kills, and fresh-
man Elizabeth Bahn was third in kills.

Water Polo

W&L won its second straight Eastern
Division III championship by beating
Johns Hopkins. The Generals closed
the season with seven wins in eight
games to finish with a 14-11 record.

W&L had some memorable wins
during the season, none more so than a
12-11 victory over arch-rival Richmond
in the Twombly Pool. A full house
watched as freshman Pete Sorensen
broke a 10-10 tie in the final minute
with a two-point goal to give the
Generals the win. W&L also beat
George Washington 14-13 by scoring the
final eight goals of the game.

In a season that took them from
Lexington to Boston to Annapolis, Md.,
to Kings Point, N.Y., the Generals’ most
unforgettable trip sent them to Califor-
nia to play in the Pomona-Pitzer tourna-
ment and to dedicate Claremont’s new
pool. On that trip, W&L won a thriller
over Loyola-Marymount 12-11 on Greg
Golub’s backhand goal as time expired.

Golub finished the season with 75
goals, giving the 1992 All-American and
first team All-East pick 200 for his
career. Joining him on this year’s All-
East team was junior captain Reuben
Munger.

Fancy Dress South
250 Turn Out in Atlanta for a Night on the Silver Screen

 

Somewhere right now, Annie Jo White must be smiling. In a year
that saw more than 200 W&L alumni gatherings nationwide, there
were get-togethers—and then there were get-togethers. And, judging by
the overwhelming success of the biggest ball of them all, Fancy Dress
South in Atlanta, the only real
mystery is why someone hadn’t
thought of it sooner.

“It was an idea that came from
an alumni board meeting,” recalls
B. Dallas Hagewood ’90, one of
the event’s primary organizers.
“We were looking for an event
that would cater to all age groups.
We were finding that younger
alumni were coming to the soft-
ball games and rafting trips, and
older people were coming to hear
Southern Comfort.”

Vobley 93, and his date, Cynthia. the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead was dressed in a Hollywood motif, com-

plete with an oversized Oscar and even Marilyn Monroe (“She came
with the decorations,” Hagewood explains). Slides from past Fancy
Dress Weekends at W&L filled the big silver screen while guests

 

Uembers of the host committee included (1-r) Frank Bazzel’72, Stanley Brading Jr. 79L,

‘The most unusual aspect of the event
may well have been the geographic

“That was probably the best-known

 

 

chapter event we have ever had,” says
Rob Mish ’76, associate director of
alumni programs, who was among those
present. “It was obvious there was a lot

W&L Open Scheduled
(Give or Take 18 Holes)

The second annual Washington and
Lee Open will be held this summer, but
at presstime we cannot say where or
when.

Last year’s event was held at The
Cascades Course at The Homestead.
Participants stayed at The Cascades
Inn. We reserved the course and the inn
for the 1994 event, but since we made
the reservations ‘The Homestead has
been acquired by new owners, Club
Resorts Inc. One of the first decisions
made by the new owners was to close
the Cascades Inn for an indefinite time.

We are working with Club Resorts to
reserve space in the main hotel at The
Homestead and to reserve starting times
at The Cascades Course, but we are also
looking at options for holding the event
at other nearby resorts, such as The
Greenbrier and Wintergreen.

A brochure will be sent out to the
W&L Open mailing list once we have
established the location and dates for
the event. If you wish to be included on

 

this list or would like to be notified as

soon as we have determined the location

and date for the Open, please contact
the Alumni Office at (703) 463-8464.

Tyndall’s Law

‘Traveling the country for Washington and Lee can be a dis-
tinctly pleasurable experience, especially when you find your-
self in Little Rock and in the company of Carrie and Tyndall
Dickinson °39, °41L. This charm-
ing couple truly live life to the
fullest and bring joy to all who
are lucky enough to meet them.

‘Tyndall’s wry sense of humor
is matched only by that of Carrie,
sister of his boyhood (and still
closest) friend, Rollie Remmel,
who attended W&L from 1935 to
1937. A young alumnus remarked

 

to me that a person always leaves
with a smile after talking with
the Dickinsons—an observation

Tyndall Dickinson 39, °41L:
Young at heart in Arkansas.

with which [| heartily concur.
They have a special talent for
making new friends, and to get to know them is to understand
the University through their bright eyes and warm hearts.

Tyndall has given himself to countless worthy causes and
charitable organizations. He has served on the boards of the
University of Arkansas, Culver Military Academy, and Hendrix
College in addition to his service as a member of W&L’s alum-
ni board. He has also played a pivotal role in strengthening his
church, First United Methodist of Little Rock, and in helping
children through the Easter Seal Society, the Boy Scouts of
America, and the Arkansas Children’s Hospital. He and Carrie
are perenially young at heart.

While at Washington and Lee, Tyndall honed his leadership
skills on the football field and at the Sigma Chi fraternity and
was inducted into ODK. Although he never practiced law, he
certainly used the knowledge garnered from the beloved
(albeit eccentric) law faculty of his day in a long and distin-
guished business career, culminating with his current service as
chief executive of McGeorge Contracting Co. The Dickinsons
raised three children and still found the time to improve the
quality of life in their community. They are forward-thinking
people who take General Lee’s call to service very seriously.

It is not surprising, therefore, that the Dickinsons have
devised a plan that will offer significant estate-oriented advan-
tages to themselves while also establishing one of the largest
scholarship funds at the University’s School of Law, the
Dickinson Scholarship Endowment. Their legacy here as well
as in Arkansas is one of love and concern for others. ‘Their self-
lessness marks them as modern-day giants on whose shoulders
we as a University family stand confidently.

Chinese Arithmetic

What happens when 400 million Chinese buy a bar of chocolate
at the same time?

To find out, seasoned political pollster V. Lance Tarrance 63
will soon have statisticians, survey researchers, and all the resources
of the famed Gallup Organization at his disposal. In a joint venture
arrangement between Gallup and the government of the People’s
Republic of China, ‘Tarrance will be the point man in a project of
unprecedented size and scope. Gallup China will become the first
foreign survey research group licensed to do business in the world’s
most populous country—and one of the few foreign majority-owned
companies in the People’s Republic. As president and managing
director, T'arrance will be in charge of conducting marketing, adver-
tising, media and audience, and social research for a host of clients
eager to invest in China’s economic boom.

‘Tarrance, who recently returned to campus as a participant in
the Commerce School’s Executive-in-Residence program, is no
stranger to fact-gather-
ing. He was director of
research at the Repub-
lican National Commit-
tee in Washington,
D.C., in 1969, special
assistant to the director
of the U.S. Bureau of
the Census in 1970, and
vice president of Dect-
sion/Making/Informa-
tion Inc., a nationally
respected polling firm,
until moving to [Texas
in 1977 to establish his

 

own firm, lTarrance &

Associates.
“The Western mind can learn much from

exposure to the East,” says Tarrance.

‘The China venture,
however, will lead ‘lar-
rance into uncharted ter-
ritory. Gallup China will cover the entire People’s Republic from its
main office in Beijing and through 18 satellite offices around the
country. “We are concentrating on the east coast, since the highest
population concentrations are there,” he says. “In China, you have
400 million people live within 150 miles of the coast, and another
800 million in the interior.” That’s nearly five times the U.S. popu-
lation in an area roughly the same size.

Tarrance’s research will be strictly consumer-based, primarily for
clients looking to break into the huge Chinese market. “At this
time, no extensive market research has been conducted on the
habits of all these potential consumers,” he says. “For the first time,
foreign companies interested in China will have quality research on
Chinese consumer tastes, preferences, dislikes, and habits.”

This is sweet news to the Chocolate Manufacturers Association,
who recently asked Gallup China to find out the answer to the
question: Do the Chinese like chocolate? As one might expect, the
answer is yes, but an answer from the folks at Gallup is never simple.
The researchers revealed some interesting tidbits about the
Chinese market, including these facts: ‘The average Chinese pur-
chases candy approximately every 20 days; 27 percent of Chinese
who snack regularly prefer chocolate; and chocolate is the most pop-
ular candy in China, and the No. 3 snack food—preceded by crack-
ers and ice cream.

Happy Meals to You

There aren’t many honest-to-gosh cowboys on the W&L
ranch, so when you come across a fellow like Joel Bernstein
57, you might be inclined to ask, What’s cooking? Good ques-

 

Ranch Dressing: Joel Bernstein ’57 looks for cooks on the range.

tion. Bernstein and his writing (and sometimes riding) partner,
Tom Bryant, visited 37 ranches between Alberta, Canada, and
the Mexican border over the course of about a year, taking
down stories and recipes to boot. The result is a volume titled
A Taste of Ranching: Cooks and Cowboys—and, in addition to
containing more than three dozen recipes (from “Beckie’s
Baked Slug” and “Creamed Kidneys on Toast” to “Montana
Kid Sourdough Pancakes” and “Sheila’s Sloppy Joe Bubble
Burgers”), the book is also a meditation on a lifestyle that’s
alive and kicking in the North American West.

“All I ever wanted to be was a cowboy,” Bernstein told
Albuquerque Journal columnist Slim Randles. As a child growing
up in Maryland, he listened to and watched the likes of
Hopalong Cassidy and ‘Tom Mix. So by the fourth grade he’s
decided he was going to be a cowboy, a quest his father helped
along with riding lessons—“twice a week for two years.”

After graduating from W&L (which then, as now, is decid-
edly lacking in the riding-and-roping curriculum) he and some
friends journeyed to Alaska, coming back by way of Montana.
Since moving out West in 1961, Bernstein has rodeoed profes-
sionally (he even “ramrodded” the rodeo team at the Univer-
sity of Montana) and raised quarter horses on ranches in
Montana and Peralta, N.M., where he and his companion of
eight years, Julie King, have lived since 1990.

Bernstein and Bryant plan six volumes in all in their Cooks
and Cowboys series, and even now he’s on the trail working on
the second one, featuring the ranches of ‘Texas. “America is
about cowboys,” Bernstein told the Jourmna/. “It’s about cow-
boys and Roy Rogers.” And ranching, he says, “is not about
dollars and cattle and land. It’s about a heritage, a way of life.”

American Gladiatrix

If you've ever watched “American Gladiators”—that larger-
than-life athletic competition featuring larger-than-life athletes

with names like ‘Turbo, Rebel, and Klektra—you have doubt-

-

ats ‘ON

 

The Best of the Best: Loretta Vandenberg ’91 and fellow Marine
Freddie Thompson enjoy that winning “Gladiators” feeling.

less imagined what it would be like to do battle in the Assault:
to take on the Wall: to face the ultimate challenge of the Elim-
inator (and if all this “Gladiators” jargon means nothing to you,
check your local weekend IV listings).

Kew of us—at least those of us in Lexington—are even up
to the challenge physically. But among the few, the proud—the
Marines—Loretta Vandenberg ’91 proved herself a worthy par-
ticipant in the Armed Forces Challenge of Champions this past
fall. Vandenberg, a Ist lieutenant and detachment commander
in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, did her service—and her a@/ma mater—
proud as half of a coed team with Corporal Freddie Thompson.

Vandenberg (dubbed “Ret” by the show’s on-air announc-
ers, Mike Adamle and Lisa Malosky) and ‘Thompson took an
early lead in the Atlasphere (which looks like it sounds), and
she then notched another six points in the Assault, running
from station to station while dodging the “relentless” tennis-
ball barrage of Jazz, and scored another five points by simply
keeping her balance atop a balancing beam while absorbing the
punishing blows of Siren in the women’s joust. She wasn’t so
fortunate on the Wall, becoming easy prey for her pursuer,
Elektra, and she appeared winded in her final event, the Elim-
inator, where her competition from the Army took the lead.

In the end, though, thanks to a truly amazing comeback by
tCammate ‘Thompson, the Marines emerged victorious. Win
ning $2,500 in the Challenge. Oh, and if you’re ever fortunate
enough to follow in Vandenberg’s footsteps into Gladiator
Arena, you’d do well to remember her words of advice on how

to tackle the Eliminator: “Run like hell.”

SHAKESPEARE FOR THE
‘90s: TWo PLAYS

A reflection on some of the
most provocative social, politi-
cal, and moral issues of our time
through two of Shakespeare’s
finest plays, The Merchant of
Venice and Antony and
Cleopatra. Both contain memo-
rable characters and famous
speeches, but Shakespeare’s
greatest genius lies in his rich
consideration of such conflicts
of justice and mercy, love and
duty, power and wit. In addition
to talks, discussions, and perfor-
mances, our week includes an
optional acting class and a
Continuing Legal Education pro-
gram on ethics. W&L faculty
include David Caudell, Joseph
Martinez, Brian Murchison, and

July 3-9: ON THE
THRESHOLD OF CHANGE:
THE AMERICAN 1890S

The most pivotal decade in our
nation’s history-years that
brought the end of the frontier,
the gathering of great cities, and
the birth of big business-pro-
duced a legacy of promise and
hazard that defined us as a peo-
ple, a legacy that both chal-
lenges and inspires us to this
day. The age also found vivid
expression in the arts as well as
popular culture: art nouveau
and the beginnings of mod-
ernism, the writings of Mark
Twain and Stephen Crane, and
the great Chicago Explosion of
1893. W&L faculty include Pam
Simpson, Jim Warren, and

July 17-23:
THE AINGDOMS OF
THE MAYA

A week on the most magnificent
yet most mysterious of the Pre-
Columbian civilizations, the
Maya, who flourished in Central
America from 600 B.C. to 1200
A.D. Who they were, what they
believed in, and how they came
to build such impressive cities

in the midst of the jungles of
Guatemala and the arid plains of
Yucatan will be the central ques-
tions, along with speculations on
the factors of their evenual col-
lapse. Faculty include W&L‘s
David Parker; David Freidel,
author of Maya Cosmos and A
Forest of Kings, from SMU; and
Dorie Reents-Buget, Curator of
Pre-Columbian art at the Duke
University Museum of Art. A
tour program of Mayan sites in
Yucatan will follow in January

of 1995.
